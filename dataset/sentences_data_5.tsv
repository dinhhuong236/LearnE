5693981	eng	Silk is soft and smooth.
5693992	eng	The dog follows me everywhere.
5694331	eng	Tom finally discovered the truth.
5695040	eng	Tom doesn't regret that decision.

5695968	eng	I drank too much again.
5695986	eng	I've actually never seen it.
5696014	eng	Tom didn't want anyone panicking.
5696018	eng	Tom didn't recognize his ex-wife.

5696237	eng	She died in the bed.
5696239	eng	She died in her bed.
5696455	eng	I am Ji Sung Park.

5698933	eng	Pterosaurs were not actually dinosaurs.
5699075	eng	Put your thinking cap on!
5699102	eng	You've lost weight haven't you?
5699125	eng	The doctor cauterised the wound.
5699129	eng	Tom is a mathematical genius.
5699152	eng	Get away from it all!
5699158	eng	I'll get even with him!
5699159	eng	I'm trying to get fit.
5699163	eng	I'm getting kind of hungry.
5699200	eng	Have you gotten paid yet?
5699770	eng	Jesus Christ is my saviour.
5699809	eng	I really like the Sun.
5699815	eng	He already went to bed.
5699816	eng	He already went to sleep.
5700081	eng	I'd hate to disappoint Tom.
5700089	eng	Tom almost always wins arguments.
5700116	eng	She sat on a bench.
5700980	eng	I think Tom knows already.
5700986	eng	Tom is interested in basketball.
5700990	eng	I know Tom appreciates it.
5701002	eng	Tom is a freelance photographer.
5701006	eng	Tom heard a helicopter overhead.
5701023	eng	His first answer was laudable.
5701192	eng	I know nothing about Tom.
5701198	eng	I consider Tom my friend.
5701200	eng	Tom has been appointed chairman.
5701822	eng	Tom explained the situation superbly.
5701845	eng	Tom eats an incredible amount.
5701929	eng	Is Tom always like this?
5701931	eng	Tom insisted on going alone.
5701933	eng	Tom is sleeping, isn't he?
5701935	eng	I thought Tom was wrong.
5702171	eng	Tom hasn't promised us anything.
5702173	eng	I expect Tom will win.
5702175	eng	Tom has started making mistakes.
5702330	eng	He goes overseas every year.
5703564	eng	My uncle lives in Tashkent.
5704954	eng	I knew Tom would ask.
5705362	eng	What's your favorite Christmas carol?
5707133	eng	My brother is a doctor.
5707153	eng	He answered with a smile.
5707160	eng	Did Tom yell at you?
5707164	eng	Did you yell at Tom?
5707234	eng	It wasn't a real kiss.
5707235	eng	It wasn't my first kiss.
5707236	eng	I shouldn't have kissed you.
5707240	eng	I asked Tom to sing.
5707244	eng	I knew Tom would go.
5707856	eng	He is under the chair.
5707860	eng	She is under the chair.
5707901	eng	This laptop is very thin.
5707904	eng	Have you washed your hands?
5707923	eng	John has a Japanese car.
5708232	eng	I bet Tom could help.
5708275	eng	I really enjoy playing putt-putt.
5708385	eng	I knew Tom would win.
5708389	eng	I lent Tom my camera.
5708392	eng	Don't ask me to help.
5708700	eng	Where is your son now?
5708701	eng	Where is your daughter now?
5710016	eng	Did Tom say he helped?
5710159	eng	"What's the time?" "It's 2:30."
5710161	eng	Does Tom have to help?
5710165	eng	Good luck to you, Tom.
5710169	eng	I doubt Tom will sing.
5710202	eng	A beer for me, please!
5710871	eng	None of us are happy.
5710872	eng	I lent Tom my bicycle.
5710876	eng	I'm sure Tom can swim.
5711368	eng	Everyone had a good year.
5711582	eng	This is the starting point.
5711598	eng	Tell Tom I won't sing.
5711602	eng	We agreed to meet Tom.
5711606	eng	Who did Tom sing with?
5711964	eng	How could you help Tom?
5712830	eng	She's selling an old-fashioned hat.
5712871	eng	Did Tom really help you?
5713281	eng	I am on the current.
5713338	eng	Her work is also valuable.
5713478	eng	Will you sing for me?
5713479	eng	I didn't dance with Tom.
5715087	eng	I like singing with Tom.
5715091	eng	I really don't know Tom.
5715095	eng	I'm sure Tom can't swim.
5715221	eng	We can't let Tom escape.
5715612	eng	With his arms, he dances.
5715656	eng	No one called for you!
5715671	eng	Such a thing often happens.
5715686	eng	Tom had to do it.
5715783	eng	Do you recognise this writing?
5715806	eng	Tom is afraid of escalators.
5715819	eng	Now, the last sprint begins.
5715833	eng	Well, it doesn't bother me!
5715838	eng	Don't be shy, go ahead!
5715924	eng	Herbalists are indispensable to botanists.
5715925	eng	You don't like this game.
5715966	eng	Life is too short, really!
5715984	eng	We need people like Tom.
5715988	eng	Did Tom really kiss Mary?
5716194	eng	We agonized over this decision.
5716294	eng	We can't survive without water.
5716357	eng	Do you like this music?
5716367	eng	Oh, how I miss you!
5716761	eng	Come to lunch with us.
5716762	eng	Good luck with that, Tom.
5716767	eng	We're extremely concerned about that.
5717403	eng	How much did this cost?
5717982	eng	Don't act like a jerk.
5718073	eng	Have you ever been happy?
5719356	eng	Santa Claus has many reindeer.
5720589	eng	I've never heard Tom cry.
5720593	eng	Is Tom really happy here?
5720597	eng	That farm belongs to Tom.
5720739	eng	Did Tom really drink that?
5720740	eng	We understand each other perfectly.
5720765	eng	Why is this computer here?
5720793	eng	Pride cometh before a fall.
5720794	eng	That ain't going to happen.
5721180	eng	Beauty can do strange things.
5722481	eng	This is Greek to me.
5723147	eng	This book changed my life.
5724907	eng	So, what was it like?
5725174	eng	He has got a job.
5725265	eng	Obviously, such arguments are preposterous.
5725282	eng	Our relationship is entirely professional.
5725288	eng	I'll never understand Australian politics.
5725291	eng	Everybody deserves affordable health care.
5725292	eng	Driver's license and registration, please.
5725302	eng	The discussions were always constructive.
5725303	eng	The children were running helter-skelter.
5725304	eng	That's a completely different phenomenon.
5725306	eng	Stereotypes are confusing and misleading.
5725307	eng	Some actions have permanent consequences.
5725309	eng	Our technology has advanced dramatically.
5725321	eng	Address issues rather than personalities.
5725322	eng	You're being ignorant and disrespectful.
5725329	eng	We disagreed without being disagreeable.
5725330	eng	Those guys were absolutely unbelievable.
5725332	eng	These containers are pretty inexpensive.
5725335	eng	The changes are absolutely mind-blowing.
5725337	eng	Our population is growing exponentially.
5725338	eng	Our influence has diminished enormously.
5725347	eng	Everyone benefited from the arrangement.
5725349	eng	Construction has fallen behind schedule.
5725350	eng	Both injuries aren't considered serious.
5725351	eng	Applications are already being accepted.
5725353	eng	Your support is overwhelmingly awesome.
5725354	eng	You've gotten everything you've wanted.
5725356	eng	You're doing something they appreciate.
5725360	eng	We've had our little misunderstandings.
5725362	eng	We've done an exhaustive investigation.
5725370	eng	We certainly didn't underestimate them.
5725373	eng	They're absolutely guilty of something.
5725374	eng	They had pretty realistic expectations.
5725375	eng	There were no mitigating circumstances.
5725376	eng	The suspect reportedly stole computers.
5725377	eng	The papers contained false information.
5725378	eng	The man surrendered without resistance.
5725380	eng	The discussions were very constructive.
5725381	eng	The current situation is unsustainable.
5725382	eng	The competition was absolutely amazing.
5725383	eng	That number has increased dramatically.
5725384	eng	Special events require additional fees.
5725386	eng	Other companies offer similar programs.
5725387	eng	Numerous other enhancements were added.
5725389	eng	Mentioning someone's race isn't racist.
5725395	eng	Just one member expressed disagreement.
5725397	eng	It's completely and utterly disgusting.
5725402	eng	I'm very uncomfortable around children.
5725412	eng	Eligible applicants are being notified.
5725413	eng	Drastic times require drastic measures.
5725415	eng	Contributors can also remain anonymous.
5725416	eng	Closing arguments will continue Monday.
5725417	eng	Americans want their borders protected.
5725418	eng	Absolutely nothing came easy yesterday.
5725420	eng	You're only postponing the inevitable.
5725423	eng	What's preventing this from happening?
5725425	eng	What happened next changed everything.
5725426	eng	We've been exploring the alternatives.
5725427	eng	We're providing an affordable service.
5725435	eng	Truck drivers face obvious challenges.
5725436	eng	Three attackers were confirmed killed.
5725437	eng	Those fears probably aren't justified.
5725438	eng	They're paying really close attention.
5725440	eng	There's always something that's wrong.
5725441	eng	There was no independent confirmation.
5725442	eng	The turnout exceeded our expectations.
5725443	eng	The findings are downright depressing.
5725444	eng	The facts weren't properly understood.
5725445	eng	The criminal investigation is ongoing.
5725447	eng	The boy wasn't immediately identified.
5725448	eng	The White House denied responsibility.
5725450	eng	That's nearly impossible to determine.
5725451	eng	That's essentially what happened here.
5725453	eng	Spending money stimulates the economy.
5725454	eng	Responsibility has to start somewhere.
5725455	eng	Registration for programs is required.
5725456	eng	Reduce administrative costs and waste.
5725457	eng	Malpractice suits are down nationally.
5725458	eng	Logging is another important industry.
5725459	eng	Linux didn't become popular overnight.
5725462	eng	Laughter rippled through the audience.
5725464	eng	I've included a visitor's application.
5725465	eng	I'll fight anybody, anywhere, anytime.
5725480	eng	Closing arguments are expected Monday.
5725486	eng	Your hypocrisy is absolutely amazing.
5725487	eng	Young people are very impressionable.
5725491	eng	We're looking at those possibilities.
5725492	eng	We're going to scrutinize everything.
5725503	eng	Usually, that's exactly what happens.
5725504	eng	Use new technologies when applicable.
5725505	eng	Unfortunately, I'm a little strapped.
5725506	eng	Twelve million people are unemployed.
5725508	eng	This shouting isn't helping anything.
5725509	eng	This product is available everywhere.
5725512	eng	Things are definitely going downhill.
5725513	eng	They're actually quite decent people.
5725515	eng	They handled this situation terribly.
5725517	eng	These mistakes are hardly surprising.
5725518	eng	These concepts are illustrated below.
5725520	eng	There's definitely a double standard.
5725521	eng	Their maintenance costs are enormous.
5725522	eng	The shooting occurred Monday morning.
5725523	eng	The result is tragically predictable.
5725525	eng	The perpetrator was obviously insane.
5725526	eng	The people's fears aren't groundless.
5725527	eng	The government hasn't been listening.
5725528	eng	The evidence is still circumstantial.
5725529	eng	The entire prison's been quarantined.
5725531	eng	The decision was eventually reversed.
5725532	eng	The decision caused widespread anger.
5725533	eng	That's an extremely helpful attitude.
5725534	eng	Several new activities are scheduled.
5725535	eng	Search operations are still underway.
5725536	eng	Sea-sickness wasn't the only problem.
5725538	eng	Other research shows similar results.
5725539	eng	Old assumptions are being challenged.
5725540	eng	No individual's rights were violated.
5725541	eng	Long-term interest rates have surged.
5725546	eng	Let's address the fundamental issues.
5725548	eng	It's definitely been pretty exciting.
5725549	eng	It's a pretty unbeatable combination.
5725551	eng	Introductions have already been made.
5725552	eng	Ignorance is destroying this country.
5725553	eng	I'm definitely more comfortable here.
5725562	eng	Giggles rippled through the audience.
5725563	eng	Everything will blow over eventually.
5725564	eng	Everyone's asking for you downstairs.
5725567	eng	Dancing will continue until midnight.
5725568	eng	Children should always be encouraged.
5725571	eng	Are steroids actually killing people?
5725572	eng	Any surgical procedure carries risks.
5725575	eng	You're really stupid, you know?
5725576	eng	You're just delaying the inevitable.
5725577	eng	You're completely missing the point.
5725578	eng	Whatever happens after this happens.
5725579	eng	We've changed our approach entirely.
5725589	eng	We're excited about the opportunity.
5725597	eng	This concludes the press conference.
5725599	eng	They're perfectly safe, aren't they?
5725600	eng	There's nothing uncommon about this.
5725602	eng	The purchase price wasn't disclosed.
5725603	eng	The guards laughed among themselves.
5725604	eng	The food looks positively delicious.
5725605	eng	The fiscal situation is challenging.
5725606	eng	The exact location wasn't disclosed.
5725607	eng	The conditions weren't always great.
5725608	eng	The committee approved the addition.
5725609	eng	The ceiling has partially collapsed.
5725610	eng	The building is absolutely stunning.
5725611	eng	The boys look horribly disappointed.
5725613	eng	The atmosphere here is unbelievable.
5725614	eng	The American public deserves better.
5725615	eng	That's what unimaginative people do.
5725616	eng	That's my new favorite catch-phrase.
5725619	eng	Such opportunities should be seized.
5725620	eng	Still, many investors remained wary.
5725621	eng	Sometimes my questions are answered.
5725623	eng	Something eventually will get built.
5725624	eng	Several students raised their hands.
5725626	eng	Please don't send email attachments.
5725627	eng	People are partying and celebrating.
5725628	eng	People are looking for alternatives.
5725629	eng	Our holidays are pretty traditional.
5725631	eng	Numerous other lawsuits are pending.
5725632	eng	Nobody suspected anything like this.
5725633	eng	No group has claimed responsibility.
5725634	eng	My parents are conservative Mormons.
5725635	eng	My husband's situation is different.
5725636	eng	Most criminals are repeat offenders.
5725637	eng	Monetary donations are also welcome.
5725638	eng	Millions of Americans were watching.
5725640	eng	Living standards are also improving.
5725643	eng	It's ridiculous to assume otherwise.
5725645	eng	It's been an eye-opening experience.
5725646	eng	It's always somebody else's problem.
5725647	eng	It's a difficult, complex challenge.
5725648	eng	It wasn't a friendly acknowledgment.
5725650	eng	It was just absolutely unbelievable.
5725652	eng	I've been given great opportunities.
5725655	eng	I'm concerned about that concussion.
5725656	eng	I work under challenging conditions.
5725665	eng	I find that completely mind-blowing.
5725666	eng	I finally ate something substantial.
5725672	eng	Here's where things get interesting.
5725674	eng	Excessive honesty can be disastrous.
5725675	eng	Everybody keeps looking for answers.
5725676	eng	Eventually, bleachers will be added.
5725677	eng	Elections are scheduled for October.
5725678	eng	Each language has its peculiarities.
5725681	eng	Could you describe those procedures?
5725682	eng	Children are normally very positive.
5725685	eng	Analysts were expecting an increase.
5725686	eng	Analysts don't expect any surprises.
5725687	eng	A helicopter buzzed around overhead.
5725688	eng	Your claim is totally unacceptable.
5725690	eng	You should've attended the wedding.
5725692	eng	You ignorance is truly frightening.
5725694	eng	Where were the building inspectors?
5725695	eng	What's your total household income?
5725696	eng	What's your social security number?
5725702	eng	We've got good, experienced people.
5725704	eng	We're taking this matter seriously.
5725705	eng	We're running a statewide campaign.
5725716	eng	We're always waiting for something.
5725717	eng	We were just playing hide-and-seek.
5725719	eng	We shouldn't lose this opportunity.
5725720	eng	We shouldn't act surprised, though.
5725723	eng	We began catching fish immediately.
5725724	eng	Those are pretty amazing dividends.
5725725	eng	Those answers will eventually come.
5725727	eng	This isn't a subjective assessment.
5725731	eng	This divorce is ruining everything.
5725732	eng	Things happened quickly after that.
5725733	eng	Things couldn't be more ship-shape.
5725734	eng	They've become suspicious about it.
5725735	eng	They're falling through the cracks.
5725736	eng	They were talking about themselves.
5725737	eng	These aren't for human consumption.
5725738	eng	These are all unanswered questions.
5725739	eng	There's nothing illegal about that.
5725741	eng	There just aren't enough customers.
5725742	eng	The whole thing sounded suspicious.
5725744	eng	The technology is still developing.
5725745	eng	The shooting occurred early Monday.
5725746	eng	The quarterback played pretty well.
5725747	eng	The police are still investigating.
5725748	eng	The girls weren't dressed properly.
5725749	eng	The excitement is already building.
5725751	eng	The consequences would be enormous.
5725752	eng	The company never really recovered.
5725753	eng	The committee lifted the sanctions.
5725754	eng	The assault was poorly coordinated.
5725755	eng	The announcement is very deceiving.
5725756	eng	The analogy is essentially correct.
5725757	eng	The Constitution may need updating.
5725758	eng	The American people deserve better.
5725759	eng	That's the problem with statistics.
5725760	eng	That's the most practical approach.
5725761	eng	That doesn't inspire my confidence.
5725762	eng	Squalls are expected later tonight.
5725764	eng	Snow is predicted Monday afternoon.
5725766	eng	Sentencing is scheduled for Monday.
5725767	eng	Prisoners aren't required to speak.
5725770	eng	Our performance wasn't good enough.
5725771	eng	Our curriculum is very streamlined.
5725772	eng	Other cities have similar problems.
5725773	eng	Opportunity is around every corner.
5725774	eng	Offshore drilling costs are rising.
5725776	eng	Neither victim has been identified.
5725777	eng	Many doctors don't accept Medicare.
5725778	eng	Limited financial aid is available.
5725783	eng	It's something we're excited about.
5725785	eng	It's not an unintended consequence.
5725787	eng	It's been exciting and stimulating.
5725789	eng	It's a markedly different approach.
5725791	eng	It would appear they're compatible.
5725792	eng	It doesn't surprise anyone anymore.
5725793	eng	Isn't that every filmmaker's dream?
5725795	eng	Investors lost billions of dollars.
5725810	eng	I succeeded beyond my expectations.

5725836	eng	You should've learned your lesson.
5725839	eng	You don't understand these things.
5725844	eng	Where's everyone's sense of humor?
5725845	eng	Wheelchair access is very limited.
5725847	eng	What makes this project different?
5725850	eng	We've learned some lessons, right?
5725854	eng	We're trying to generate business.
5725856	eng	We're stronger and safer together.
5725858	eng	We're still looking for donations.
5725864	eng	We're not being properly informed.
5725866	eng	We're never getting back together.
5725867	eng	We're looking at that possibility.
5725881	eng	We're always trying something new.
5725883	eng	We truly appreciate your business.
5725884	eng	We really appreciate their effort.
5725891	eng	We did some unconventional things.
5725892	eng	Tomorrow might be quite different.
5725893	eng	Those changes were very important.
5725895	eng	This isn't the government's fault.
5725899	eng	This honestly doesn't surprise me.
5725900	eng	This didn't just happen overnight.
5725901	eng	This article is partially correct.
5725902	eng	This article doesn't explain much.
5725904	eng	Things always work themselves out.
5725905	eng	They've already grown so attached.
5725906	eng	They're still just friends, right?
5725907	eng	They're keeping their dream alive.
5725908	eng	They're a really wonderful couple.
5725909	eng	They're a bunch of contradictions.
5725910	eng	They were always good competition.
5725913	eng	They greeted each other cordially.
5725914	eng	They found their home burglarized.
5725915	eng	They face more serious challenges.
5725916	eng	They drink like nobody's business.
5725917	eng	They appreciate the little things.
5725918	eng	These people have lost everything.
5725919	eng	There was always that possibility.
5725920	eng	There are other possible problems.
5725921	eng	Their support has been invaluable.
5725922	eng	Their efforts didn't go unnoticed.
5725925	eng	The victim's name wasn't released.
5725926	eng	The victim hasn't been identified.

5725929	eng	The storm eventually blew through.
5725930	eng	The slippery slope is unavoidable.
5725931	eng	The situation is changing rapidly.
5725932	eng	The school was meticulously clean.
5725933	eng	The menu looks absolutely amazing.
5725934	eng	The meeting quickly became heated.
5725935	eng	The industry isn't well regulated.

5725937	eng	The crowd was really appreciative.
5725938	eng	The community support was amazing.
5725939	eng	The church offered them sanctuary.

5725941	eng	The assessment is being contested.
5725942	eng	The American people aren't stupid.
5725944	eng	That would explain your dizziness.
5725946	eng	That doesn't make good television.
5725947	eng	Thanks for the added information.
5725948	eng	Talk like that isn't constructive.
5725949	eng	Strange things happen in baseball.
5725950	eng	Stand by for further instructions.
5725951	eng	Sometimes I believe in fairytales.
5725952	eng	Something drastic needs to happen.
5725953	eng	Someone is making money somewhere.

5725963	eng	Perhaps somebody can enlighten me.
5725965	eng	Operations were resumed on Monday.
5725966	eng	Obviously the adjustment was hard.
5725969	eng	Nothing could be more fundamental.
5725970	eng	Nothing could be more frightening.
5725971	eng	No publication date was announced.
5725972	eng	No outside employment was allowed.
5725974	eng	Neighbors said they heard yelling.
5725977	eng	Mistakes have obviously been made.
5725984	eng	Let's consider a concrete example.
5725987	eng	Knee replacement is major surgery.
5725988	eng	It's very advanced and futuristic.
5725991	eng	It's considered an aggressive act.
5725992	eng	It's clearly a challenging market.
5725993	eng	It's an interesting business plan.
5725994	eng	It's almost impossible to achieve.
5725995	eng	It's a requirement for graduation.
5725997	eng	It was an understandable decision.
5725998	eng	It depends upon several variables.
5726002	eng	I'm not worried about comparisons.
5726009	eng	I never understood their argument.
5726013	eng	I didn't feel totally comfortable.
5726014	eng	I couldn't imagine anything worse.
5726020	eng	Hopefully, that's about to change.

5726030	eng	Does it contain recycled material?
5726036	eng	Clearly, I make you uncomfortable.

5726042	eng	Are you convinced it's economical?
5726044	eng	Adults are welcome to participate.
5726045	eng	Your commitment helps your cause.
5726046	eng	You're the authority figure here.
5726047	eng	You'll feel a tingling sensation.
5726048	eng	You weren't answering your phone.
5726049	eng	You people can't help yourselves.
5726050	eng	You can't make broad assumptions.
5726051	eng	You aren't answering my question.
5726052	eng	Will this affect foreign tourism?
5726057	eng	What you're asking is impossible.
5726058	eng	What really counts is friendship.
5726061	eng	What exactly is money laundering?
5726062	eng	What ever happened to innovation?
5726072	eng	We've become much more selective.
5726075	eng	We're trying to compete globally.
5726076	eng	We're the ones who're different.
5726083	eng	We're people like everybody else.
5726092	eng	We're not expecting any handouts.
5726101	eng	We're getting ahead of ourselves.
5726102	eng	We're destroying our own country.
5726112	eng	We'll provide drinks and dessert.
5726130	eng	We think it's pretty significant.
5726135	eng	We regret you've become involved.
5726157	eng	We haven't thought of everything.
5726160	eng	We haven't been properly trained.
5726178	eng	We all had different assignments.
5726179	eng	Was anything different this time?
5726180	eng	Victory won't be achieved easily.
5726181	eng	Unfortunately, this news is true.
5726182	eng	Too much power causes corruption.
5726183	eng	Tomorrow it'll be something else.
5726184	eng	Those chips aren't yet available.
5726186	eng	This would be our recommendation.
5726188	eng	This isn't our final destination.
5726190	eng	They're pretty much in agreement.
5726192	eng	They were evicted without notice.
5726193	eng	They said they would investigate.
5726194	eng	They keep making that allegation.
5726196	eng	There's always plenty of trouble.
5726197	eng	There was severe property damage.
5726198	eng	There was no explanation offered.
5726200	eng	Their marriage was falling apart.
5726201	eng	The zombies attacked the joggers.
5726202	eng	The world is constantly changing.
5726203	eng	The whole thing is contradictory.
5726204	eng	The violence doesn't surprise me.
5726205	eng	The training was never completed.
5726207	eng	The store was immediately closed.
5726208	eng	The smoke was unbelievably thick.
5726209	eng	The sign was immediately removed.
5726210	eng	The results could be devastating.
5726211	eng	The purchase was perfectly legal.
5726212	eng	The price jump was unprecedented.
5726213	eng	The premise is relatively simple.
5726214	eng	The physical demands are extreme.
5726215	eng	The movie was absolutely amazing.
5726216	eng	The man was immediately arrested.
5726217	eng	The letter was postmarked Boston.
5726219	eng	The kids showed great enthusiasm.
5726220	eng	The judgment isn't entirely fair.
5726221	eng	The introductions are being made.
5726222	eng	The fundamental premise is wrong.
5726223	eng	The festival starts October 20th.
5726224	eng	The excitement level is building.
5726227	eng	The deliberations took three days.
5726229	eng	The crowd waited in anticipation.
5726230	eng	The crowd roared in anticipation.
5726232	eng	The crowd immediately grew quiet.
5726233	eng	The attraction is obvious enough.
5726235	eng	That's what makes us exceptional.
5726236	eng	That's the difference between us.
5726238	eng	That's the challenge for parents.
5726239	eng	That's something people can hide.
5726241	eng	That's simple breach of contract.
5726242	eng	That's a truly interesting story.
5726244	eng	That's a pretty horrible thought.
5726247	eng	That wasn't entirely an accident.
5726248	eng	That makes things more difficult.
5726251	eng	That complicated the whole thing.
5726253	eng	Take-out meals will be available.
5726256	eng	Speak only when you're addressed.
5726257	eng	Sometimes it's just the opposite.
5726259	eng	Sometimes even that isn't enough.
5726260	eng	Something about this concerns me.
5726262	eng	Some people were downright nasty.
5726263	eng	Some Americans are being cheated.
5726265	eng	Republicans oppose any new taxes.
5726266	eng	Reports of injuries are mounting.
5726268	eng	Report to the captain's quarters.
5726272	eng	People are friendly in Australia.
5726274	eng	People are beginning to perspire.
5726275	eng	Participants should bring a gift.
5726277	eng	Our confidence is extremely high.
5726280	eng	Now it's illegal to discriminate.
5726281	eng	Nothing much really frightens me.
5726285	eng	No one watching was disappointed.
5726288	eng	Neither was wearing a lifejacket.
5726290	eng	Neither report cited any sources.
5726293	eng	Maybe we're connected by destiny.
5726294	eng	Many people disliked that change.
5726296	eng	Malaria is a preventable disease.
5726299	eng	Lower taxes don't cause deficits.
5726306	eng	Let's not overstate matters here.
5726312	eng	Let's consider my alternate plan.
5726314	eng	Leaving is simply not acceptable.
5726315	eng	It's unfortunate, but it happens.
5726317	eng	It's not a governmental question.
5726318	eng	It's currently located in Boston.
5726320	eng	It's always someone else's fault.
5726321	eng	It's a good challenge, obviously.
5726323	eng	It's a beautifully designed boat.
5726326	eng	It created an unsafe environment.
5726329	eng	Isn't that what management wants?
5726330	eng	Is your grandmother really dying?
5726333	eng	Instead of fretting, take action.
5726339	eng	I'm absolutely convinced of that.
5726341	eng	I'll never forget their kindness.
5726342	eng	I wouldn't do anything different.
5726350	eng	I was discriminated against once.
5726352	eng	Tom's appointment takes effect immediately.
5726355	eng	Tom's appointment is effective immediately.
5726371	eng	I think we're being shortsighted.
5726372	eng	I think Australia is fascinating.
5726450	eng	Tom's treatment may require transfusions.
5726451	eng	I have an incredible opportunity.
5726453	eng	Tom's survival was considered miraculous.
5726456	eng	Tom's reputation isn't exactly untainted.
5726458	eng	I found that absolutely shocking.
5726466	eng	I don't want anybody celebrating.
5726470	eng	I don't like violence whatsoever.
5726509	eng	I appreciate your prompt payment.
5726510	eng	Tom's resignation was effective Monday.
5726511	eng	I always felt emotionally abused.
5726512	eng	I agree wholeheartedly with that.
5726513	eng	Tom's petition was eventually accepted.
5726516	eng	Tom's funeral arrangements are pending.
5726517	eng	How would you introduce yourself?
5726521	eng	How did you express disagreement?
5726523	eng	How common are meteorite strikes?
5726524	eng	How about building more outposts?
5726526	eng	High school students are welcome.
5726527	eng	Here are the latest developments.
5726529	eng	Gold futures were sharply higher.
5726530	eng	Foxes have few natural predators.
5726532	eng	Fireflies flash to attract mates.
5726533	eng	Failure is a temporary condition.
5726536	eng	Don't take anything from anybody.
5726538	eng	Don't forget your spending money.
5726539	eng	Doctors make such lousy patients.
5726545	eng	Cost estimates have been refined.
5726548	eng	Cleaning actually makes us happy.
5726550	eng	Cicadas aren't harmful to humans.
5726551	eng	Childhood obesity is an epidemic.
5726552	eng	Tom didn't recommend specific measures.
5726557	eng	Bad government is bad government.
5726559	eng	Attendance has hit record levels.
5726560	eng	Are you still politically active?
5726562	eng	Are you questioning my character?
5726563	eng	Any insight would be appreciated.
5726565	eng	Actually, I meant something else.
5726566	eng	Your support has been wonderful.
5726568	eng	You've been keeping pretty busy.
5726569	eng	You're the most obvious suspect.
5726572	eng	You're making a good impression.
5726573	eng	Tom's studies soon attracted interest.
5726574	eng	You're looking a little flushed.
5726575	eng	You're keeping busy, aren't you?
5726576	eng	Tom's present whereabouts are unknown.
5726577	eng	You're getting balder every day.
5726578	eng	You're dragging me down already.
5726579	eng	Tom's current whereabouts are unknown.
5726580	eng	You're cute when you're annoyed.
5726581	eng	You'll never succeed without me.
5726583	eng	You need an attitude adjustment.
5726587	eng	You certainly couldn't do worse.
5726589	eng	Words can't describe this place.
5726590	eng	Why must everything be personal?
5726592	eng	Why are you suddenly aggressive?
5726593	eng	Which should be addressed first?
5726595	eng	Where is the government funding?
5726596	eng	Where did such rumors originate?
5726598	eng	What's your favorite comic book?
5726599	eng	What's so concerning about that?
5726600	eng	Tom quit attending university classes.
5726602	eng	What was your relationship like?
5726603	eng	Tom made many important contributions.
5726604	eng	What are your favorite pastimes?
5726614	eng	We've got to have determination.
5726618	eng	Tom has non-life threatening injuries.
5726625	eng	We're waiting for the all-clear.
5726629	eng	We're trying to build something.
5726635	eng	We're pleased with the decision.
5726638	eng	We're on unfamiliar ground here.
5726639	eng	Tom's brother, John, predeceased him.
5726640	eng	We're not just football players.
5726641	eng	We're not holding anything back.
5726642	eng	Tom's approach is somewhat different.
5726644	eng	We're not experts in psychology.
5726648	eng	Tom was extremely aggressive tonight.
5726664	eng	We're determined to get answers.
5726667	eng	We're coming to your assistance.
5726689	eng	We won't condone any corruption.
5726706	eng	We think the government's wrong.
5726716	eng	We practically grew up together.
5726726	eng	Tom's injuries are considered minor.
5726729	eng	Tom's death was confirmed yesterday.
5726732	eng	Tom's behavior isn't harming anyone.
5726735	eng	Tom wouldn't discuss the allegation.
5726736	eng	We just have differing opinions.
5728383	eng	Tom is a prolific reader.
5728519	eng	Tom is a girly boy.
5728813	eng	We haven't really done anything.
5728816	eng	We haven't changed our position.
5728818	eng	Tom takes himself awfully seriously.
5728819	eng	We haven't actually tested that.
5728833	eng	Tom offered a different perspective.
5728835	eng	We certainly don't endorse that.
5728838	eng	Was there any physical evidence?
5728840	eng	Visitors and guests are welcome.
5728841	eng	Unfortunately, I agree with you.
5728842	eng	Tom is attending Harvard University.
5728843	eng	This reasoning is really insane.
5728844	eng	This program isn't for everyone.
5728846	eng	This place really is immaculate.
5728852	eng	This exploitation needs to stop.
5728853	eng	This experiment is worth trying.
5728854	eng	Tom has many underworld connections.
5728855	eng	This challenge must be overcome.
5728856	eng	This can't be emphasized enough.
5728858	eng	This book is highly recommended.
5728859	eng	Things wind down about midnight.
5728861	eng	Things weren't what they seemed.
5728862	eng	Things were looking rather good.
5728864	eng	They're now making minimum wage.
5728865	eng	They're heading straight for us.
5728867	eng	They're extremely busy up there.
5728868	eng	They're already being cared for.
5728870	eng	They're all expected to recover.
5728871	eng	They're acting out of character.
5728873	eng	They'll probably be calling you.
5728874	eng	They'll make their own decision.
5728876	eng	They were probably drunk anyway.
5728877	eng	They were being very optimistic.
5728880	eng	They seriously deserve an award.
5728882	eng	They exchanged looks of concern.
5728883	eng	These people are exploiting you.
5728885	eng	These issues must be confronted.
5728886	eng	There's some collusion going on.
5728888	eng	There's going to be competition.
5728889	eng	There will be ugly consequences.
5728890	eng	Tom's remains were never recovered.
5728893	eng	Tom's nomination had been expected.
5728895	eng	The third option is unthinkable.
5728896	eng	Tom's murder has remained unsolved.
5728897	eng	The subject was never addressed.
5728898	eng	The sidewalk is well maintained.
5728900	eng	The shame was almost unbearable.
5728901	eng	The road is closed indefinitely.
5728903	eng	The restoration is long overdue.
5728904	eng	The recovery has been lethargic.
5728907	eng	The public is really responding.
5728909	eng	The public already distrusts us.
5728910	eng	The process has already started.
5728912	eng	The police wouldn't do anything.
5728913	eng	The noise is becoming deafening.
5728915	eng	The loss was really devastating.
5728918	eng	The interior was completely new.
5728919	eng	The interface isn't fast enough.
5728922	eng	The house isn't completely done.
5728924	eng	The guy looks slightly confused.
5728925	eng	The gunmen robbed the travelers.
5728928	eng	The government isn't helping us.
5728930	eng	The government has abandoned us.
5728931	eng	The gift is greatly appreciated.
5728933	eng	The general public can't attend.
5728934	eng	The firm is under investigation.
5728936	eng	The entire program needs reform.
5728937	eng	The defendants will please rise.
5728939	eng	The crowds here are spectacular.
5728940	eng	The crowd erupted with laughter.
5728942	eng	The crowd begins to disassemble.
5728943	eng	The consequences are well known.
5728944	eng	Tom showered Mary with compliments.
5728945	eng	The coaches kept encouraging me.
5728946	eng	The charges have been dismissed.
5728949	eng	The boys look very disappointed.
5728951	eng	The book received mixed reviews.
5728952	eng	The atmosphere is very informal.
5728955	eng	The American people have spoken.
5728957	eng	That's when things became tense.
5728958	eng	That's what we call consistency.
5728960	eng	That's what they're counting on.
5728961	eng	That's the difference this year.
5728963	eng	That's never stopped you before.
5728964	eng	That's how our government works.
5728965	eng	Tom said he's entirely self-taught.
5728966	eng	That's exactly what we're doing.
5728967	eng	That would probably help people.
5728972	eng	That problem still exists today.
5728973	eng	That has become painfully clear.
5728975	eng	That drives me absolutely crazy.
5728976	eng	Structurally it's in good shape.
5728978	eng	Sometimes you have to surrender.
5728979	eng	Some might call that convenient.
5728982	eng	Set learning goals for yourself.
5728984	eng	Rest assured that we'll respond.
5728987	eng	Purple carrots would be strange.
5728988	eng	Protests are likely to increase.
5728989	eng	Tom practiced rowing every morning.
5728990	eng	Proper management is the answer.
5728992	eng	Tom politely rejected the proposal.
5728994	eng	Please don't ask for statistics.
5728996	eng	People aren't watching the game.
5728997	eng	People aren't prepared for this.
5728998	eng	Tom pleaded guilty to manslaughter.
5728999	eng	People are looking for sympathy.
5729000	eng	Our situation is very fortunate.
5729001	eng	Tom pleaded guilty to embezzlement.
5729002	eng	Opossums aren't related to rats.
5729003	eng	Numbers speak louder than words.
5729005	eng	Nothing else would be plausible.
5729006	eng	Nothing could be more misguided.
5729007	eng	Tom nearly missed that opportunity.
5729008	eng	Nobody will need an explanation.
5729009	eng	Nobody is comfortable with that.
5729010	eng	Tom loved bringing people together.
5729011	eng	Nobody is being refused service.
5729012	eng	No one sought medical treatment.
5729014	eng	No one has taken responsibility.
5729015	eng	Millions were affected that day.
5729017	eng	Many young people feel hopeless.
5729029	eng	Let's all go tomorrow afternoon.
5729030	eng	Last night was particularly hot.
5729032	eng	Last night was particularly bad.
5729033	eng	Keep religion out of government.
5729039	eng	It's unclear when that occurred.
5729041	eng	It's still a difficult decision.
5729042	eng	It's definitely a full-time job.
5729045	eng	It's been a learning experience.
5729046	eng	Tom is currently attending college.
5729047	eng	It's a very humbling experience.
5729048	eng	It wasn't immediately clear why.
5729050	eng	It wasn't a comfortable feeling.
5729051	eng	It was everything I anticipated.
5729053	eng	It was an inappropriate analogy.
5729054	eng	It should be avoided completely.
5729056	eng	It has actually been beneficial.
5729059	eng	It allegedly cost them billions.
5729060	eng	Is that something you recommend?
5729061	eng	Tom immediately sprang into action.
5729064	eng	Tom immediately reported the crime.
5729071	eng	I've liked everything I've seen.
5729082	eng	Tom examined all the possibilities.
5729085	eng	Tom doesn't take himself seriously.
5729092	eng	I'm really angry and frustrated.
5729094	eng	Tom didn't follow stage directions.
5729096	eng	I'm not running for re-election.
5729097	eng	Tom didn't face serious opposition.
5729098	eng	I'm not prepared for retirement.
5729102	eng	I'm not advocating deadly force.
5729103	eng	Tom can't stand being disrespected.
5729104	eng	I'm learning something of value.
5729111	eng	I'm hoping it's not significant.
5729202	eng	Detectives believe Tom acted alone.
5729204	eng	I'm excited about the challenge.
5729409	eng	I'm concerned about this merger.
5729410	eng	I'm absolutely sickened by this.
5729417	eng	Violence isn't Tom's only concern.
5729420	eng	Tom's speech was slightly slurred.
5729423	eng	Tom's job description has changed.
5729432	eng	Tom's approval rating is dropping.
5729458	eng	I think that's really appealing.
5729462	eng	Tom usually travels by motorcycle.
5729474	eng	Tom took the suggestion seriously.
5729498	eng	Tom pledged his continued support.
5729503	eng	I don't recommend this approach.
5729507	eng	Tom passed out almost immediately.
5729513	eng	Tom mysteriously vanished in 2013.
5729516	eng	Tom must be absolutely devastated.
5729517	eng	I didn't walk away disappointed.
5729527	eng	I can't believe you're grounded.
5729531	eng	Tom isn't your typical bureaucrat.
5729534	eng	Tom isn't your average politician.
5729538	eng	I assume that you're reasonable.
5729541	eng	How would your classmates react?
5729547	eng	Hopefully that clears things up.
5729548	eng	Has anyone requested a briefing?
5729550	eng	Give me till tomorrow afternoon.
5729551	eng	Fossil fuels are being depleted.
5729553	eng	Firefighters came to the rescue.
5729555	eng	Tom has no credibility whatsoever.
5729556	eng	Everyone learns from each other.
5729557	eng	Everyone knows who started this.
5729558	eng	Tom has concerns about everything.
5729559	eng	Everyone has challenges in life.
5729560	eng	Everybody has been so wonderful.
5729561	eng	Tom has already undergone surgery.
5729562	eng	Double nothing is still nothing.
5729563	eng	Don't get caught clock watching.
5729565	eng	Dead men can accomplish nothing.
5729570	eng	Tom had severe emotional problems.
5729572	eng	Braces aren't just for children.
5729574	eng	Both things are closely related.
5729578	eng	You've covered your bases well.
5729580	eng	You're under arrest for murder.
5729583	eng	You're really dense, aren't you?
5729584	eng	You still haven't explained it.
5729586	eng	You just might learn something.
5729587	eng	You have this completely wrong.
5729589	eng	Would you expect anything else?
5729590	eng	Would that be called recycling?
5729591	eng	Tom didn't particularly like Mary.
5729592	eng	Winter will arrive soon enough.
5729593	eng	Will raccoons hurt my chickens?
5729594	eng	Tom didn't accelerate soon enough.
5729595	eng	Why wouldn't they be delighted?
5729596	eng	Where's the creativity in that?
5729599	eng	Where are your favorite places?
5729601	eng	What's this stock really worth?
5729602	eng	What're you standing there for?
5729604	eng	What'll appeal to our audience?
5729605	eng	What you're feeling isn't real.
5729607	eng	What might the consequences be?
5729608	eng	What makes this time different?
5729616	eng	Were there any other customers?
5729618	eng	Tom announced the decision Monday.
5729620	eng	We've seen this pattern before.
5729621	eng	Tom also had some disappointments.
5729627	eng	Several weeks later, Tom resigned.
5729633	eng	It definitely got Tom's attention.
5729635	eng	We're trying to plan something.
5729636	eng	Investigators say Tom acted alone.
5729644	eng	We're open to more suggestions.
5729646	eng	We're not turning anybody down.
5729649	eng	We're not looking for converts.
5729654	eng	A noise attracted Tom's attention.
5729659	eng	We're in a miserable situation.
5729661	eng	We're happy everybody is alive.
5729665	eng	We're going to lose everything.
5729666	eng	Water isn't Tom's favorite drink.
5729669	eng	Tom's voice cracked with emotion.
5729670	eng	We're going out again tomorrow.
5729672	eng	Tom's problems didn't stop there.
5729673	eng	We're giving them the go-ahead.
5729674	eng	We're facing a profound change.
5729676	eng	We're exceedingly proud of you.
5729677	eng	We're children compared to you.
5729678	eng	Tom's design was highly original.
5729682	eng	We're always thinking about it.
5729685	eng	We're almost like best friends.
5729690	eng	Tom's approach will be different.
5729693	eng	Tom's answer took everyone aback.
5729696	eng	Tom's accusations were on target.
5729707	eng	We sustained some minor damage.
5729723	eng	Tom suffered only minor injuries.
5729726	eng	Tom still attends those meetings.
5729728	eng	We know there'll be challenges.
5729736	eng	We haven't yet determined that.
5729741	eng	Tom repeatedly revved his engine.
5729750	eng	Tom pleaded guilty to harassment.
5729752	eng	We can't anticipate the future.
5729754	eng	We ask everyone to participate.
5729755	eng	Was there an assessment rubric?
5729756	eng	Tom never fully appreciated that.
5729759	eng	Tom needs to take responsibility.
5729760	eng	Tourism is very important here.
5729761	eng	Thousands of kids were adopted.
5729762	eng	Tom meets all those requirements.
5729763	eng	Thousands of jobs were created.
5729764	eng	This wasn't an intentional act.
5729766	eng	This was a learning experience.
5729772	eng	This is totally achievable now.
5729774	eng	Tom listened with rapt attention.
5729778	eng	This is an illegal transaction.
5729779	eng	This is a learning opportunity.
5729783	eng	Tom isn't your typical executive.
5729784	eng	This continues to be maddening.
5729785	eng	This can be extremely damaging.
5729786	eng	Tom isn't entitled to protection.
5729787	eng	This book was a disappointment.
5729788	eng	Think globally but act locally.
5729790	eng	They're expected to dress well.
5729791	eng	They're doing some good things.
5729793	eng	They're all in there somewhere.
5729796	eng	They were stopped and arrested.
5729797	eng	They were holding their ground.
5729798	eng	Tom is dangerous, very dangerous.
5729799	eng	They have found several bodies.
5729800	eng	They didn't know what happened.
5729801	eng	Tom is charged with manslaughter.
5729802	eng	They could make the difference.
5729803	eng	They clearly know it's serious.
5729804	eng	Tom is an independent-minded guy.
5729807	eng	Tom is always planning something.
5729808	eng	These sinkholes are time bombs.
5729810	eng	Tom is against same-sex marriage.
5729811	eng	These playing cards are marked.
5729813	eng	Tom heard a bloodcurdling scream.
5729815	eng	There's a double standard here.
5729817	eng	There was an adjustment period.
5729818	eng	There ought to be consequences.
5729820	eng	There must be an investigation.
5729821	eng	There just wasn't enough money.
5729822	eng	Tom has three surviving children.
5729823	eng	There haven't been any arrests.
5729826	eng	There are grounds for optimism.
5729827	eng	Their customer service is poor.
5729828	eng	Tom has no diplomatic experience.
5729830	eng	The two robberies were related.
5729834	eng	Tom has exceeded my expectations.
5729835	eng	The result is easily predicted.
5729836	eng	The rest is purely speculation.
5729838	eng	The quarterback is really good.
5729839	eng	The process took several weeks.
5729840	eng	Tom has congestive heart failure.
5729841	eng	The policy was quickly changed.
5729842	eng	The place is practically empty.
5729843	eng	Tom has attended many ceremonies.
5729844	eng	The natives are restless today.
5729845	eng	The lawsuit isn't yet resolved.
5729847	eng	The law wasn't always enforced.
5729848	eng	The judgment is being appealed.
5729850	eng	The judgment has been appealed.
5729852	eng	Tom has always been professional.
5729853	eng	The gunmen had several demands.
5729854	eng	The group entered the building.
5729855	eng	Tom eventually turned himself in.
5729856	eng	The government wants your guns.
5729857	eng	The filing deadline was Monday.
5729859	eng	The feeling is probably mutual.
5729860	eng	The entire country was shocked.
5729861	eng	Tom didn't retract his statement.
5729862	eng	The electrical cord is missing.
5729863	eng	The demand has been incredible.
5729864	eng	Tom didn't attack you personally.
5729865	eng	The defense has requested bail.
5729866	eng	The defendant will please rise.
5729868	eng	The day was largely uneventful.
5729870	eng	Tom collapsed and died instantly.
5729871	eng	The contract lasts three years.
5729872	eng	The conference room was silent.
5729874	eng	The conditions were very rough.
5729875	eng	The attack came after midnight.
5729878	eng	That's what makes them special.
5729879	eng	Tom accepted the position Monday.
5729881	eng	That's going to help everybody.
5729882	eng	This is Tom's greatest challenge.
5729883	eng	That's a very generous gesture.
5729884	eng	That was basically my question.
5729888	eng	That's clearly what Tom suspects.
5729889	eng	Teach your children about them.
5729890	eng	Surprisingly, I felt very safe.
5729892	eng	Start living within your means.
5729893	eng	Somebody tipped off the police.
5729895	eng	Somebody needs a good spanking.
5729898	eng	Soldiers are human beings, too.
5729899	eng	Skin color makes no difference.
5729902	eng	Retirement is becoming a worry.
5729904	eng	Rest assured they're out there.
5729907	eng	Promise them whatever you want.
5729908	eng	Prices for Treasury bonds fell.
5729911	eng	Pesticides could be one answer.
5729913	eng	Perhaps you could enlighten us.
5729914	eng	Our reputation will be sullied.
5729916	eng	Our performance was a disaster.
5729917	eng	Our freedoms are being limited.
5729918	eng	What happened next startled Tom.
5729919	eng	Our fans were absolutely crazy.
5729920	eng	Obesity is a problem worldwide.
5729922	eng	Now you're piquing my interest.
5729923	eng	Nothing's wrong with my French.
5729925	eng	Nobody did anything after that.
5729926	eng	No wonder you're so indecisive.
5729928	eng	No suspects have been arrested.
5729929	eng	No major violence was reported.
5729930	eng	Tom's second language is French.
5729931	eng	No cost estimate was available.
5729932	eng	Neither was wearing a seatbelt.
5729933	eng	Tom's not making any guarantees.
5729934	eng	My children attend that school.
5729935	eng	Move carefully to avoid injury.
5729937	eng	Most people don't realize this.
5729938	eng	Many attacks may go unreported.
5729939	eng	Tom's decision caused an uproar.
5729940	eng	Major surgery isn't the answer.
5729947	eng	Let's enjoy this beautiful day.
5729948	eng	Tom was reported missing Monday.
5729949	eng	Let's assume that won't happen.
5729952	eng	It's very difficult to acquire.
5729953	eng	It's too complicated to answer.
5729954	eng	Tom was later released unharmed.
5729956	eng	It's something you dream about.
5729959	eng	It's not as depressing anymore.
5729961	eng	It's like a double-edged sword.
5729962	eng	It's interesting that you lost.
5729963	eng	Tom was found brutally murdered.
5729964	eng	It's getting better every week.
5729967	eng	It's been a remarkable journey.
5729968	eng	It's always the parents' fault.
5729970	eng	It's a very dangerous strategy.
5729971	eng	It'll be a wonderful adventure.
5729972	eng	Tom was appointed shortly after.
5729973	eng	It was helpful and interesting.
5729974	eng	It was an intriguing situation.
5729975	eng	Tom was always so unpredictable.
5729976	eng	It was an extraordinary moment.
5729977	eng	It was an embarrassing episode.
5729982	eng	It could be hugely significant.
5729983	eng	It apparently no longer exists.
5730810	eng	Is that what you're thinking?
5730813	eng	Is it difficult to concentrate?
5730815	eng	Investigators say it was arson.
5730816	eng	Injuries can happen to anybody.
5730820	eng	Tom started to behave strangely.
5730822	eng	I've made a catastrophic error.
5730823	eng	Tom stabbed Mary multiple times.
5730824	eng	I've had martial arts training.
5730825	eng	I've got three young daughters.
5730828	eng	I'm very comfortable with that.
5730829	eng	I'm surprised, but not shocked.
5730834	eng	I'm responsible for my conduct.
5730845	eng	Tom runs a landscaping business.
5730846	eng	I'm not Canadian. I'm Japanese.
5730849	eng	I'm just getting the runaround.
5730853	eng	I'm appalled by such ignorance.
5730859	eng	I'll complete my training soon.
5730863	eng	Tom needs to resign immediately.
5730869	eng	Tom may have been disoriented.
5730872	eng	Tom made friends with everybody.
5730875	eng	Tom made Mary's life impossible.
5730877	eng	I wasn't charged with anything.
5730884	eng	Tom later denied the allegation.
5730890	eng	Tom just shrugged his shoulders.
5730895	eng	I think you're seriously wrong.
5730912	eng	I think it's clearly justified.
5730916	eng	I take responsibility for that.
5730918	eng	I suddenly felt really strange.
5730926	eng	Tom is breathing really heavily.
5730937	eng	I love everything you're doing.
5730947	eng	Tom has never lacked confidence.
5730953	eng	Tom has it completely backwards.
5730959	eng	Tom has an impressive portfolio.
5730962	eng	Tom has accepted his punishment.
5730968	eng	Tom hadn't planned on returning.
5730984	eng	I had been incarcerated before.
5730986	eng	Tom escaped with minor injuries.
5730990	eng	I find that terribly troubling.
5730994	eng	I don't understand the context.
5730996	eng	I don't understand some people.
5731013	eng	Tom consulted with his attorney.
5731016	eng	Tom clearly has the credentials.
5731017	eng	I don't anticipate it stopping.
5731023	eng	I didn't have any expectations.
5731027	eng	I deserve a relaxing afternoon.
5731028	eng	Tom called the sheriff's office.
5731034	eng	Tom called Mary after breakfast.
5731041	eng	I believe we're moving forward.
5731043	eng	Tom began to behave erratically.
5731045	eng	How many crimes were committed?
5731047	eng	How common are surgical errors?
5731048	eng	How addictive is crack cocaine?
5731050	eng	Hopefully they don't overdo it.
5731051	eng	Have you checked their pockets?
5731052	eng	Tom amassed an enormous fortune.
5731054	eng	Fighting poverty is the answer.
5731056	eng	Fear quickly turned into anger.
5731057	eng	Everything was about to change.
5731061	eng	The police searched Tom's house.
5731062	eng	Everyone had each other's back.
5731063	eng	Everybody is trying to improve.
5731065	eng	Even notebooks can be recycled.
5731067	eng	Only Tom's valuables were taken.
5731069	eng	Don't expect a coherent answer.
5731071	eng	Don't blame me for complaining.
5731072	eng	Do your parents ever interfere?
5731074	eng	Do you consider yourself black?
5731075	eng	Do they have contingency plans?
5731078	eng	Do I understand this correctly?
5731080	eng	Did these things really happen?
5731084	eng	Deflation is almost always bad.
5731086	eng	Consider adopting an older pet.
5731087	eng	Cholesterol is a silent killer.
5731089	eng	Censoring won't hide the truth.
5731090	eng	Can you explain that statement?
5731092	eng	Bow hunting season opens today.
5731093	eng	Boston wasn't built over night.
5731095	eng	Blue jeans are also acceptable.
5731096	eng	Beware of the double standards.
5731099	eng	Aspirin comes from willow bark.
5731101	eng	Are you following my reasoning?
5731104	eng	Anything you've got would help.
5731105	eng	All was forgiven and forgotten.
5731106	eng	I couldn't believe Tom resigned.
5731107	eng	You've got to love technology.
5731108	eng	You're turning into a chicken.
5731720	eng	Something's not right with Tom.
5731732	eng	Here's another question for Tom.
5731734	eng	You're not very well informed.
5731736	eng	You're bound to be discovered.
5731737	eng	You're blinded by your hatred.
5731740	eng	You're a horrible human being.
5731742	eng	You'll have your own bathroom.
5731743	eng	You'll have to choose quickly.
5731744	eng	Can Tom bring everyone together?
5731748	eng	You should learn to proofread.
5731749	eng	You passed with flying colors.
5731751	eng	You needn't say anything more.
5731753	eng	With Tom, anything is possible.
5731755	eng	You haven't understood at all.
5731756	eng	What's Tom reading this summer?
5731757	eng	You have an excellent analyst.
5731759	eng	What was your inspiration, Tom?
5731760	eng	You can't choose your masters.
5731762	eng	What punishment should Tom get?
5731763	eng	Write something nice about it.
5731766	eng	Will insurance premiums go up?
5731768	eng	We're extremely happy with Tom.
5731770	eng	Who was the arresting officer?
5731771	eng	Tom's trial started in October.
5731773	eng	When's the next hunger strike?
5731775	eng	What's wrong with the picture?
5731776	eng	What's up with our government?
5731777	eng	Tom's resume speaks for itself.
5731778	eng	What's the reason behind this?
5731779	eng	What's the real priority here?
5731780	eng	Tom's record speaks for itself.
5731781	eng	What's the big occasion today?
5731782	eng	What's changed over the years?
5731783	eng	Tom's position isn't yet clear.
5731785	eng	What most defines a community?
5731786	eng	Tom's parents weren't so lucky.
5731787	eng	What happened to that project?
5731792	eng	Tom's family is very religious.
5731794	eng	What challenges might we face?
5731795	eng	Tom's enthusiasm has caught on.
5731796	eng	Were you doing something else?
5731799	eng	We've had a long relationship.
5731801	eng	Tom's body was found yesterday.
5731806	eng	We're waiting for our lawyers.
5731810	eng	Tom will get re-elected easily.
5731813	eng	Tom will accompany the singers.
5731815	eng	We're ready for the elections.
5731821	eng	We're learning how to compete.
5731828	eng	Tom was shocked and humiliated.
5731830	eng	We're here because we're poor.
5731831	eng	Tom was shocked and bewildered.
5731833	eng	We're going to need everybody.
5731837	eng	Tom was only partly successful.
5731843	eng	Tom was found mortally wounded.
5731848	eng	We'll have a delicious dinner.
5731849	eng	Tom was clearly onto something.
5731850	eng	We'll be profitable this year.
5731852	eng	Tom was captured shortly after.
5731853	eng	We wouldn't last five minutes.
5731854	eng	We were struggling to survive.
5731857	eng	We were competitive this year.
5731860	eng	We were a hard-working family.
5731863	eng	We wanted to keep celebrating.
5731872	eng	We strongly condemn such acts.
5731874	eng	We squeezed into the elevator.
5731879	eng	Tom stepped into the spotlight.
5731884	eng	We must be extremely vigilant.
5731888	eng	Tom should count his blessings.
5731891	eng	Tom served exactly three years.
5731894	eng	Tom searched Mary's room again.
5731903	eng	Tom said he couldn't elaborate.
5731913	eng	We don't condone your actions.
5731914	eng	We didn't create the problems.
5731916	eng	We can eliminate parking fees.
5731917	eng	Was this an arranged marriage?
5731918	eng	Tom really couldn't believe it.
5731920	eng	Torpedoes are armed and ready.
5731922	eng	Too many people are uninsured.
5731923	eng	This was a major contribution.
5731925	eng	This storm is getting serious.
5731929	eng	This is of particular concern.
5731933	eng	Tom never doubted Mary's story.
5731934	eng	This could've been a disaster.
5731935	eng	This could push prices higher.
5731938	eng	They've cleared out the place.
5731940	eng	They're calling off the fight.
5731941	eng	They're calling it a homicide.
5731943	eng	They'll think we cheated them.
5731944	eng	They were never seen together.
5731946	eng	They shouldn't be allowed out.
5731947	eng	They said changes were coming.
5731948	eng	Tom makes an interesting point.
5731949	eng	They may feel some resentment.
5731950	eng	They just couldn't grasp that.
5731951	eng	Tom made a surprising decision.
5731952	eng	They couldn't find that plane.
5731953	eng	They become exuberant as well.
5731956	eng	There's plenty of stuff there.
5731957	eng	Tom likes to complicate things.
5731958	eng	There's not enough jail space.
5731959	eng	There's more talk than action.
5731961	eng	There's a place for everybody.
5731962	eng	There were some growing pains.
5731964	eng	There were screams and groans.
5731970	eng	There was absolutely no doubt.
5731971	eng	There just wasn't enough time.
5731972	eng	Tom knows he's vulnerable here.
5731973	eng	There aren't really any rules.
5731976	eng	There are plenty of obstacles.
5731977	eng	There are other costs, though.
5731979	eng	There are no strings attached.
5731980	eng	There are many other examples.
5731981	eng	Tom kept screaming Mary's name.
5731983	eng	Their bodies were never found.
5731984	eng	Tom isn't running for governor.
5731985	eng	The wolves are getting closer.
5731986	eng	The truth is more complicated.
5731987	eng	Tom isn't exactly welcome here.
5731989	eng	The surgery is very expensive.
5731990	eng	Tom isn't a seasoned performer.
5731992	eng	The strain is clearly showing.
5731994	eng	The solutions aren't so clear.
5731995	eng	The room exploded in laughter.
5731997	eng	The response time was amazing.
5731998	eng	The response has been amazing.
5732000	eng	The real answer is surprising.
5732004	eng	The police have been informed.
5732005	eng	Tom is damaging his reputation.
5732006	eng	The plot isn't that important.
5732007	eng	The owner couldn't be located.
5732008	eng	Tom is cunning and calculating.
5732009	eng	The opposite is actually true.
5732012	eng	The museum is open year-round.
5732013	eng	The military is always hiring.
5732015	eng	The meeting is obviously over.
5732018	eng	The firing pin's been removed.
5732025	eng	The dance is pretty hilarious.
5732026	eng	Tom is an extraordinary jumper.
5732029	eng	Tom is an excellent ambassador.
5732575	eng	Tom is always so unpredictable.
5732576	eng	The charges have been dropped.
5732578	eng	Tom is a tremendous competitor.
5732579	eng	The battle was virtually over.
5732581	eng	Tom is a cold-blooded murderer.
5732583	eng	That's what they're all about.
5732584	eng	Tom instigated the whole thing.
5732585	eng	That's what the country needs.
5732586	eng	That's what really angered me.
5732588	eng	That's starting to change now.
5732589	eng	That's really the only reason.
5732590	eng	Tom hasn't lost his confidence.
5732595	eng	That's better than we thought.
5732596	eng	Tom has suffered head injuries.
5732597	eng	That's all anyone ever wanted.
5732598	eng	That's a lot more interesting.
5732601	eng	That's a battle worth winning.
5732603	eng	That would just be ridiculous.
5732604	eng	That won't be necessary today.
5732606	eng	That was enough for everybody.
5732607	eng	That was an incredible battle.
5732609	eng	That was a conscious decision.
5732612	eng	That much is completely clear.
5732614	eng	Tom has co-written three books.
5732615	eng	That clearly isn't true today.
5732616	eng	That changed suddenly in 2013.
5732618	eng	Sugar comes from many sources.
5732620	eng	Tom has been really consistent.
5732621	eng	Sorry for the stupid question.
5732624	eng	Some were pretty badly burned.
5732666	eng	I don't like long journeys.
5732678	eng	The girl didn't say anything.
5732783	eng	Some people can understand me.
5732786	eng	Security was also a challenge.
5732787	eng	Tom had something to celebrate.
5732793	eng	Tom gripped Mary's arm tightly.
5732794	eng	Piracy is a problem worldwide.
5732795	eng	People will always be unhappy.
5732798	eng	People are starting to notice.
5732801	eng	People are losing their homes.
5732802	eng	Tom found himself a girlfriend.
5732803	eng	People are creatures of habit.
5732808	eng	Tom felt no remorse whatsoever.
5732813	eng	Nothing will ever change that.
5732814	eng	Tom eventually moved to Boston.
5732815	eng	Nothing will ever change here.
5732818	eng	No other arrests are expected.
5732819	eng	No doubt they feel threatened.
5732821	eng	Milk allergies are quite rare.
5732822	eng	Many were injured, some badly.
5732824	eng	Many states have similar laws.
5732825	eng	Little has changed since then.
5732826	eng	Tom doesn't speak for everyone.
5732827	eng	Listen closely to the options.
5732828	eng	Life is all about adjustments.
5732829	eng	Tom doesn't believe in doctors.
5732832	eng	Tom does just about everything.
5732837	eng	Let's hope that changes today.
5732838	eng	Tom didn't report Mary missing.
5732841	eng	Tom didn't leave any witnesses.
5732845	eng	Just talking really does help.
5732846	eng	It's time to change direction.
5732848	eng	It's not about cost reduction.
5732849	eng	It's not a volunteer position.
5732851	eng	It's just a great opportunity.
5732854	eng	It's a very rewarding feeling.
5732855	eng	It's a very comfortable house.
5732857	eng	It would have been unbearable.
5732858	eng	It wasn't an isolated problem.
5732859	eng	Tom didn't complete his degree.
5732860	eng	It was like Christmas morning.
5732861	eng	It was clearly something else.
5732863	eng	It was an overnight sensation.
5732864	eng	It was an excellent editorial.
5732865	eng	Tom didn't come entirely clean.
5732867	eng	It was a life-changing moment.
5732868	eng	Tom didn't buy those arguments.
5732870	eng	It helped me out tremendously.
5732872	eng	It hasn't been widely adopted.
5732873	eng	It gave me great satisfaction.
5732875	eng	It ended up being unnecessary.
5732876	eng	It didn't seem very effective.
5732877	eng	Tom couldn't live without Mary.
5732878	eng	It couldn't be more different.
5732879	eng	It could trigger a depression.
5732880	eng	Tom couldn't cope with failure.
5732881	eng	It completely changed my life.
5732882	eng	It can be extremely difficult.
5732883	eng	Tom could be available tonight.
5732884	eng	It can be extremely dangerous.
5732887	eng	Isn't that a little premature?
5732888	eng	Is your home properly insured?
5732889	eng	Tom certainly doesn't think so.
5732891	eng	Is there room for improvement?
5732895	eng	Tom barely survived the attack.
5732898	eng	Tom assumed command once again.
5732905	eng	I've been praying all morning.
5732913	eng	Tom accompanied Mary to Boston.
5732919	eng	There's nobody better than Tom.
5732924	eng	I'm not giving medical advice.
5732930	eng	I'm not afraid of electricity.
5732935	eng	I'm living the American dream.
5732937	eng	Something has caught Tom's eye.
5732938	eng	I'm just not that interesting.
5732940	eng	Somebody knocked on Tom's door.
5732950	eng	I'm focused on being governor.
5732951	eng	I'm confident we'll get there.
5732954	eng	I'm a pretty frequent shopper.
5732959	eng	I'll never forget that sunset.
5732963	eng	I'll be homeschooling my kids.
5732968	eng	I wouldn't call them veterans.
5732987	eng	I think we were well-prepared.
5732999	eng	I think that's our obligation.
5733001	eng	I think that's most important.
5733007	eng	I think it's pretty fantastic.
5733008	eng	I suspect this was deliberate.
5733013	eng	I stopped believing in myself.
5733019	eng	I sincerely hope you're vegan.
5733028	eng	I really enjoyed reading that.
5733038	eng	I made some fantastic lasagna.
5733040	eng	Has Tom even visited Australia?
5733046	eng	Guess who Tom's caseworker was?
5733058	eng	Did Tom take banned substances?
5733069	eng	I hope people understand that.
5733100	eng	Tom, however, can't act alone.
5733103	eng	Tom's wife keeps him grounded.
5733105	eng	I don't think it's convincing.
5733124	eng	Tom's first love was baseball.
5733126	eng	I didn't expect thanks anyway.
5733130	eng	Tom's facing an uphill battle.
5733131	eng	I didn't call them vigilantes.
5733136	eng	Tom's dog was found uninjured.
5733137	eng	I could hardly contain myself.
5733138	eng	I consider myself very stupid.
5733141	eng	I can't stand ignorant people.
5733142	eng	Tom's clothes are soaking wet.
5733145	eng	Tom's adoptive father is John.
5733146	eng	I can't guarantee the outcome.
5733150	eng	I can't emphasize that enough.
5733163	eng	Tom won't be easily dissuaded.
5733164	eng	How quickly can things change?
5733167	eng	How can anyone criticize this?
5733168	eng	How are other people managing?
5733169	eng	Tom will probably get charged.
5733176	eng	Everything is under the table.
5733180	eng	Everyone is invited to attend.
5733182	eng	Everyone is happy and healthy.
5733185	eng	Everyone has a breaking point.
5733186	eng	Everybody wants to be outside.
5733188	eng	Dues are collected in October.
5733189	eng	Don't become attached to them.
5733191	eng	Doing this is extremely tough.
5733192	eng	Does the government even care?
5733194	eng	Does anyone know your secrets?
5733195	eng	Does anybody notice a pattern?
5733197	eng	Do you suffer from depression?
5733198	eng	Do you share common interests?
5733201	eng	Dinner was delicious as usual.
5733206	eng	Change has to start somewhere.
5733208	eng	Tom wasn't exactly a stranger.
5733210	eng	Can someone refresh my memory?
5733213	eng	Boeing builds a fine aircraft.
5733215	eng	Blood donors are needed today.
5733216	eng	Better late than never, right?
5733218	eng	Be prepared for the rejection.
5733225	eng	Aluminum is a malleable metal.
5733229	eng	About a dozen people attended.
5733234	eng	You'll never break my spirit.
5733235	eng	You'll just be losing ground.
5733251	eng	I think you'll appreciate it.
5733259	eng	Tom was screaming and yelling.
5733260	eng	You'll find no argument here.
5733263	eng	You must enjoy the attention.
5733264	eng	You haven't changed one iota.
5733300	eng	You can't protect me forever.
5733301	eng	You can't deceive us anymore.
5733307	eng	Why are people living longer?
5733308	eng	Tom was paralyzed with terror.
5733388	eng	Who wouldn't watch that show?
5733389	eng	Tom was operated on yesterday.
5733391	eng	Who cares where it's located?
5733393	eng	Who built this thing, anyway?
5733396	eng	What's your average day like?
5733397	eng	What's wrong with being sexy?
5733432	eng	What's the concept all about?
5733433	eng	What you're feeling is wrong.
5733434	eng	Tom was later pronounced dead.
5733436	eng	What would be the motivation?
5733652	eng	Then, you can refute it.
5733659	eng	Is life beautiful or not?
5733687	eng	Give birth in a tree.
5733705	eng	I think you are crazy.
5733724	eng	What has brought this change?
5733725	eng	What exactly are the charges?
5733730	eng	Wear boots to avoid slipping.
5733755	eng	We've changed so many things.
5733792	eng	Tom was clearly the aggressor.
5733794	eng	We've been through it before.
5733802	eng	Tom was arrested within hours.
5733929	eng	We're still working that out.
5733932	eng	We're still clearing that up.
5733937	eng	Tom was arrested that evening.
5734008	eng	Tom was arrested early Monday.
5734009	eng	We're losing too much ground.
5734013	eng	We're just like best friends.
5734014	eng	Tom was apprehended in Boston.
5734016	eng	We're in this thing together.
5734251	eng	We're here to demand justice.
5734253	eng	Tom wants to remain anonymous.
5734281	eng	Tom wanted to write something.
5734283	eng	We're expecting a busy night.
5734286	eng	We're covering all our bases.
5734298	eng	We'll try again next weekend.
5734300	eng	We'll take whatever you have.
5734478	eng	We three will stick together.
5734479	eng	Tom thought he'd forgotten it.
5734482	eng	Tom thought Mary was pregnant.
5734605	eng	Tom suffered from bone cancer.
5734615	eng	We haven't been informed yet.
5734622	eng	We have that opportunity now.
5734623	eng	Tom still gets very emotional.
5734625	eng	We have more information now.
5734626	eng	Tom still couldn't believe it.
5734628	eng	We have a leadership problem.
5734630	eng	We feel good about ourselves.
5734631	eng	We dreamed of this happening.
5734643	eng	We clearly won that argument.
5734644	eng	We all understood the stakes.
5734645	eng	Tom soon became healthy again.
5734646	eng	We all understand the stakes.
5734647	eng	We agree with that sentiment.
5734649	eng	We absolutely love this town.
5734650	eng	Water clarity is fairly good.
5734651	eng	Tom signed the divorce papers.
5734659	eng	Today is definitely your day.
5734660	eng	Tom should get an application.
5734661	eng	To answer your question, yes.
5734664	eng	This would be more realistic.
5734665	eng	This was your decision alone.
5734668	eng	This was a successful attack.
5734671	eng	This rule should be followed.
5734674	eng	This isn't a secret document.
5734676	eng	This isn't a laughing matter.
5734677	eng	This is the obvious solution.
5734681	eng	Tom saw Mary's true potential.
5734685	eng	This is even more disgusting.
5734688	eng	This is definitely a concern.
5734691	eng	This is better than expected.
5734692	eng	This is a terrible injustice.
5734694	eng	This is a remarkable finding.
5734696	eng	Tom said he wasn't handcuffed.
5734698	eng	This envelope has no address.
5734701	eng	Things are going pretty well.
5734703	eng	They're not coming after you.
5734704	eng	They're going to execute you.
5734706	eng	They take care of themselves.
5734707	eng	They knew they were cheating.
5734709	eng	They could be going anywhere.
5734710	eng	They called each other names.
5734711	eng	Tom resigned after his arrest.
5734712	eng	They both pleaded not guilty.
5734713	eng	They attacked me from behind.
5734714	eng	Tom reiterated what Mary said.
5734715	eng	They aren't involved in this.
5734716	eng	They approach the front desk.
5734719	eng	These are high quality tires.
5734721	eng	There's plenty of work there.
5734722	eng	There's nothing in the works.
5734723	eng	Tom refrained from doing that.
5734724	eng	There's no right answer here.
5734727	eng	There's more funding to come.
5734728	eng	There's good reason for that.
5734730	eng	There's barely enough for me.
5734731	eng	There will be more surprises.
5734763	eng	There were no easy decisions.
5734765	eng	There was no immediate panic.
5734766	eng	Tom realized he couldn't talk.
5734768	eng	There could be no compromise.
5734770	eng	There are problems with this.
5734771	eng	There are other changes, too.
5734773	eng	There are no obvious answers.
5734774	eng	The whole family is stressed.
5734776	eng	The video quality is amazing.
5734777	eng	The victim hasn't been named.
5734779	eng	The verdict has been reached.
5734780	eng	The trend isn't looking good.
5734783	eng	The temptation is too strong.
5734784	eng	Tom pointed out one exception.
5734786	eng	The stock market has crashed.
5734788	eng	The solution here is complex.
5734790	eng	Tom pitched really well today.
5734791	eng	The shelves were pretty bare.
5734947	eng	Tom pitched an excellent game.
5734948	eng	The secret is officially out.
5734950	eng	Tom owns a high-powered rifle.
5734951	eng	The scene was really amazing.
5734953	eng	Tom overdosed three years ago.
5734954	eng	The request simply amazed me.
5734955	eng	The reason now seems obvious.
5734957	eng	The radiation would kill you.
5734958	eng	The pump was left unattended.
5734960	eng	The project is still ongoing.
5734961	eng	The process was pretty clear.
5734962	eng	Tom now faces another dilemma.
5734963	eng	The potential market is huge.
5734964	eng	The police have been alerted.
5734966	eng	The police fired three shots.
5734967	eng	The police can't do anything.
5734972	eng	The money isn't being wasted.
5734973	eng	The meeting went really well.
5734974	eng	Tom needs a new dermatologist.
5734976	eng	The mattress felt like rocks.
5734986	eng	The meeting went pretty well.
5734987	eng	Tom may have some competition.
5734988	eng	The main lobby appears empty.
5734989	eng	The kids didn't see anything.
5734990	eng	Tom makes us feel comfortable.
5734991	eng	The jury is now deliberating.
5734993	eng	Tom makes light of everything.
5734994	eng	The judge refused the appeal.
5734999	eng	Tom made one serious omission.
5735000	eng	The initial report was wrong.
5735001	eng	The group is extremely tight.
5735003	eng	The government can't do that.
5735004	eng	The girls continued to fight.
5735005	eng	Tom made a terrible discovery.
5735006	eng	The fire smoldered for hours.
5735007	eng	The fire continues to spread.
5735008	eng	Tom made a shocking statement.
5735009	eng	The experience has been good.
5735010	eng	The entire family is shocked.
5735011	eng	Tom made a horrible discovery.
5735012	eng	The driver had been drinking.
5735013	eng	The difference could be huge.
5735014	eng	Tom loves being around people.
5735019	eng	Tom loved his children dearly.
5735020	eng	The crowd began to dissipate.
5735021	eng	The council meets on Mondays.
5735024	eng	The confusion only got worse.
5735025	eng	Tom looked through his wallet.
5735028	eng	Tom looked completely at home.
5735029	eng	The children don't know that.
5735030	eng	The biggest problem is water.
5735031	eng	Tom liked everything he heard.
5735032	eng	That's why you're in college.
5735033	eng	That's why we're really here.
5735035	eng	That's what the show's about.
5735036	eng	That's what the law dictates.
5735038	eng	That's what many people said.
5735039	eng	That's what makes you strong.
5735041	eng	That's unusual on two counts.
5735042	eng	That's too close for comfort.
5735044	eng	That's super important to me.
5735045	eng	That's something to build on.
5735047	eng	That's something I aspire to.
5735048	eng	That's really why we're here.
5735439	eng	Do you always travel first-class?
5735558	eng	That's how we'll approach it.
5735560	eng	That's how these things work.
5735561	eng	That's how it normally works.
5735563	eng	That's definitely part of it.
5735564	eng	That's a huge problem really.
5735566	eng	That's a good starting point.
5735567	eng	That's a challenge in itself.
5735570	eng	That'll be your top priority.
5735573	eng	That was never our intention.
5735574	eng	Tom just seems lost sometimes.
5735576	eng	That was definitely sad news.
5735578	eng	That was a fundamental error.
5735580	eng	Tom isn't your typical pastor.
5735582	eng	That in itself isn't unusual.
5735585	eng	That could mean real trouble.
5735586	eng	Tom isn't thinking about that.
5735589	eng	Tom isn't an elected official.
5735590	eng	Slow down to avoid accidents.
5735591	eng	Share this with your friends.
5735598	eng	Tom is the official spokesman.
5735599	eng	Please be fair and impartial.
5735602	eng	People let their guards down.
5735603	eng	People die in different ways.
5735606	eng	Our veterans deserve no less.
5735607	eng	Tom is the alleged ringleader.
5735608	eng	Our children deserve no less.
5735609	eng	Our children aren't to blame.
5735612	eng	Obviously, it's a big relief.
5735614	eng	Now, the situation is better.
5735615	eng	Now that's not very friendly.
5735617	eng	Now that's a retirement plan.
5735618	eng	Now that's a different story.
5735620	eng	Now that will be interesting.
5735621	eng	Now open your fortune cookie.
5735623	eng	Nothing worked for very long.
5735627	eng	Nothing is beyond your power.
5735629	eng	Nothing could be more absurd.
5735630	eng	Nothing can survive in there.
5735632	eng	None were wearing seat belts.
5735633	eng	None of us are indispensable.
5735635	eng	Nobody's in favor of torture.
5735636	eng	No credit cards are accepted.
5735637	eng	Tom is disgusted with himself.
5735638	eng	No charges were ever brought.
5735639	eng	Neither was wearing a helmet.
5735640	eng	Tom is destroying Mary's life.
5735641	eng	My worst nightmare came true.
5735642	eng	My teammates have been great.
5735644	eng	My sources are very reliable.
5735647	eng	My dancing career isn't over.
5735648	eng	Music isn't really a science.
5735653	eng	Mondays are open mike nights.
5735656	eng	Many Americans feel this way.
5735657	eng	Make sure you have insurance.
5735661	eng	Tom is already thinking ahead.
5735663	eng	Let's keep it in perspective.
5735665	eng	Let's give them more support.
5735668	eng	Just an apology isn't enough.
5735670	eng	Tom is acting program manager.
5735672	eng	It's survival of the fittest.
5735674	eng	It's simply cause and effect.
5735675	eng	It's really different for me.
5735680	eng	It's more realistic that way.
5735681	eng	It's funny because it's true.
5735683	eng	It's easy to get cooperation.
5735684	eng	It's cause for major concern.
5735687	eng	It's always important to win.
5735689	eng	It's a pretty amazing script.
5735690	eng	It's a lot of responsibility.
5735692	eng	It's a cause for celebration.
5735693	eng	It wasn't a happy experience.
5735695	eng	It was reconstructed in 2013.
5735696	eng	It was approved last October.
5735702	eng	It started right on schedule.
5735705	eng	It must be almost unbearable.
5735707	eng	It makes good business sense.
5735708	eng	It makes a little difference.
5735711	eng	It happened three more times.
5735713	eng	It doesn't require a battery.
5735714	eng	It depends on the conditions.
5735715	eng	Tom has suffered many losses.
5735716	eng	It definitely freaked me out.
5735717	eng	It couldn't be anything else.
5735718	eng	Tom hasn't been proven guilty.
5735719	eng	It could go either direction.
5735720	eng	It certainly makes me wonder.
5735722	eng	Isn't that at least possible?
5735723	eng	Is this really your position?
5735725	eng	Is this a conscious decision?
5735727	eng	Tom has played extremely well.
5735730	eng	Tom has nothing to contribute.
5735735	eng	I've enjoyed college a lot.
5735738	eng	I've been doing that forever.
5735739	eng	Tom has no political ambition.
5735746	eng	I'm very comfortable with it.
5735749	eng	I'm terribly ashamed of this.
5735753	eng	I'm offended by your apology.
5735755	eng	I'm not very chatty, usually.
5735770	eng	I'm fairly convinced of that.
5735773	eng	I'm doing everything for you.
5735776	eng	I'm already a senior citizen.
5735783	eng	I'll change your tires later.
5735785	eng	I'd probably agree with that.
5735793	eng	Tom has admitted killing Mary.
5735803	eng	I was really happy, actually.
5735814	eng	Tom had three lovely children.
5735821	eng	I thought everybody did that.
5735825	eng	I think we're just beginning.
5735827	eng	I think we're getting closer.
5735836	eng	I think that's stretching it.
5735837	eng	I think people are delighted.
5735839	eng	I think it's really immature.
5735842	eng	I think everyone wishes that.
5735848	eng	I remember that time vividly.
5735849	eng	I never stopped making music.
5735859	eng	Tom gave an acceptance speech.
5735880	eng	Tom finally reached the hotel.
5735884	eng	I have a strange premonition.
5735892	eng	Tom felt a little intimidated.
5735897	eng	I feel like we're connecting.
5735898	eng	Tom failed the polygraph test.
5735900	eng	I don't worry about mistakes.
5735902	eng	I don't worry about anything.
5735919	eng	Tom doesn't like his contract.
5735929	eng	I disagree with your premise.
5735934	eng	Tom disappeared into thin air.
5735942	eng	I didn't care about anything.
5735945	eng	I cried frantically for help.
5735947	eng	I couldn't thank them enough.
5735948	eng	I couldn't compete with that.
5735950	eng	I certainly don't claim that.
5735952	eng	Tom didn't want Mary murdered.
5735956	eng	I can't explain that feeling.
5735957	eng	I can't drive long distances.
5735958	eng	Tom didn't violate his parole.
5735967	eng	Tom didn't leave the hospital.
5735969	eng	I believe in personal choice.
5735971	eng	I arrived in Boston recently.
5735972	eng	I always feel very supported.
5735975	eng	Hunger is the best appetizer.
5735979	eng	Tom deserves the firing squad.
5735981	eng	How can you protect yourself?
5735982	eng	Tom definitely won the debate.
5735984	eng	How can malaria be contained?
5735985	eng	Tom couldn't have agreed more.
5735986	eng	How are these decisions made?
5735987	eng	Have somebody check that out.
5735988	eng	Tom could offer no assurances.
5735989	eng	Has this not happened before?
5735993	eng	God has answered our prayers.
5735995	eng	Go ahead with your questions.
5735999	eng	Everyone was talking at once.
5736001	eng	Everyone wants to get better.
5736003	eng	Tom conferred with his lawyer.
5736005	eng	Everyone is looking for that.
5736006	eng	Tom can't run for re-election.
5736009	eng	Tom can definitely get better.
5736011	eng	Europe is our biggest market.
5736014	eng	Each session lasts two hours.
5736015	eng	Tom called the situation dire.
5736017	eng	Don't be flippant about this.
5736019	eng	Does this bother anyone else?
5736024	eng	Tom believed Mary would leave.
5736025	eng	Cops are asking me questions.
5736029	eng	Common sense isn't so common.
5736030	eng	Tom became a surrogate parent.
5736032	eng	Coffee is a popular beverage.
5736033	eng	Tom attended school in Boston.
5736035	eng	Clearly the game has changed.
5736036	eng	Tom appeared to be inebriated.
5736040	eng	Canoes can be rented locally.
5736041	eng	Can you trust the weatherman?
5736042	eng	Tom always wears dark glasses.
5736045	eng	Tom also witnessed the attack.
5736047	eng	Can they handle the pressure?
5736048	eng	Tom admits he was overwhelmed.
5736049	eng	Can that happen in Australia?
5736053	eng	Bring your own picnic basket.
5736056	eng	Auditions will start at 2:30.
5736057	eng	They haven't found Tom's body.
5736058	eng	Are you taking the challenge?
5736059	eng	Are you ready for retirement?
5736061	eng	Are they afraid of something?
5736062	eng	Are there really such people?
5736063	eng	The accused was Tom's brother.
5736064	eng	Appreciate what you have now.
5736065	eng	Anger is a defense mechanism.
5736066	eng	That's what's great about Tom.
5736067	eng	An inquest will be conducted.
5736068	eng	An autopsy will be performed.
5736070	eng	An autopsy will be conducted.
5736072	eng	That wasn't Tom's only secret.
5736073	eng	All our systems were damaged.
5736078	eng	Sometimes Tom is really crazy.
5736079	eng	Your age doesn't concern me.
5736080	eng	You're the cook, aren't you?
5736081	eng	The police were interrogating Tom.
5736082	eng	You're not your normal self.
5736085	eng	You won't believe the price.
5736086	eng	You should get out sometime.
5736088	eng	You should ask yourself why.
5736089	eng	You remember all that stuff?
5736091	eng	You may still owe something.
5736094	eng	You have to remain detached.
5736095	eng	You have everything to gain.
5736098	eng	You can't complain too much.
5736100	eng	Won't it keep till tomorrow?
5736101	eng	Women are smarter than that.
5736103	eng	Will this game be televised?
5736104	eng	Why would things change now?
5736106	eng	Why would they subpoena you?
5736109	eng	Why start your own business?
5736110	eng	Why are these women whining?
5736114	eng	I thought Tom was outstanding.
5736115	eng	Who was the target audience?
5736116	eng	Who was the injured cyclist?
5736119	eng	Who dreams up these surveys?
5736121	eng	When was the last explosion?
5736124	eng	What's wrong with the water?
5736125	eng	What's there to blush about?
5736127	eng	What's the solution to this?
5736128	eng	What were they motivated by?
5736130	eng	What the heck happened here?
5736133	eng	What problem did you notice?
5736134	eng	What on earth was happening?
5736136	eng	What made this so different?
5736137	eng	What game were you watching?
5736139	eng	What does this program cost?
5736140	eng	What could turn this around?
5736142	eng	What are you people smoking?
5736145	eng	What actions are you taking?
5736146	eng	Well, that's pretty much it.
5736148	eng	Well, that's it for tonight.
5736149	eng	Well, that's a little crazy.
5736151	eng	Well, isn't this just great.
5736154	eng	We've never had this before.
5736155	eng	We've never had that before.
5736157	eng	We've looked at every angle.
5736160	eng	We've got to think positive.
5736169	eng	We're working on this issue.
5736172	eng	We're upset about this loss.
5736173	eng	We're trying to assess that.
5736176	eng	We're still not safe enough.
5736179	eng	We're short-handed as it is.
5736181	eng	We're really lucky for that.
5736187	eng	We're not convinced of this.
5736190	eng	We're much better than this.
5736191	eng	We're making too much money.
5736195	eng	Everyone knows you killed Tom.
5736208	eng	Call Tom for more information.
5736209	eng	We're determined to push on.
5736211	eng	Wouldn't that be lovely, Tom?
5736213	eng	We're cleaning up this area.
5736221	eng	We'll bring them to justice.
5736225	eng	We were unlucky, that's all.
5736228	eng	We were pretty good tonight.
5736230	eng	We were doing the housework.
5736232	eng	We'll do everything with Tom.
5736233	eng	We were a little complacent.
5736240	eng	We should get back upstairs.
5736242	eng	We should expect some chaos.
5736243	eng	We see each other regularly.
5736244	eng	Tom's wife was a cheerleader.
5736248	eng	We only accept cash payment.
5736249	eng	We need your expert opinion.
5736251	eng	We need this issue resolved.
5736252	eng	We need more brave soldiers.
5736253	eng	Tom's solution was no better.
5736257	eng	We must keep moving forward.
5736260	eng	We might miss something big.
5736261	eng	We make everything to order.
5736262	eng	Tom's record was wiped clean.
5736263	eng	We made the necessary moves.
5736265	eng	Tom's reaction was very calm.
5736268	eng	Tom's prognosis is very good.
5736274	eng	Tom's heart was beating fast.
5736282	eng	We have to have limitations.
5736283	eng	Tom's function was to advise.
5736289	eng	Tom's eyes blazed with anger.
5736290	eng	We have the funds available.
5736291	eng	We have safeguards in place.
5736294	eng	We have everything in order.
5736295	eng	Tom's crash was very serious.
5736296	eng	We have a simple philosophy.
5736297	eng	We have a great opportunity.
5736298	eng	Tom's car was parked outside.
5736299	eng	We have a disadvantage here.
5736300	eng	We have a beautiful country.
5736301	eng	Tom's body hasn't been found.
5736302	eng	We had to adjust everything.
5736306	eng	We don't need your services.
5736311	eng	We don't apologize for this.
5736312	eng	We created our own problems.
5736313	eng	Tom worked in intensive care.
5736314	eng	We couldn't be more excited.
5736315	eng	We can't work without tools.
5736317	eng	We can never change history.
5736318	eng	We both smiled in amazement.
5736319	eng	Tom will never sanction this.
5736321	eng	We actually talked about it.
5736323	eng	Watch out for stupid people.
5736324	eng	Was it guilt by association?
5736326	eng	Wake up, guys. It's morning.
5736327	eng	Wait until after the season.
5736329	eng	Violence is the only answer.
5736331	eng	Tom will deliver the address.
5736332	eng	Try looking in your pockets.
5736333	eng	Today's game won't be close.
5736334	eng	Tom will be sentenced Monday.
5736338	eng	This time, it was different.
5736341	eng	This makes it sound amazing.
5736342	eng	This issue isn't going away.
5736343	eng	Tom will appeal the judgment.
5736345	eng	This isn't a trivial number.
5736346	eng	Tom will administer the oath.
5736350	eng	This is definitely more fun.
5736351	eng	This is an unbelievable day.
5736352	eng	Tom went missing last Monday.
5736353	eng	This is a sensible approach.
5736354	eng	This is a problem worldwide.
5736356	eng	This hardly makes any sense.
5736360	eng	This choice wasn't too hard.
5736361	eng	Tom wasn't just being polite.
5736362	eng	This car is really powerful.
5736363	eng	This can only cause trouble.
5736366	eng	They're waiting for my call.
5736367	eng	Tom was treated and released.
5736368	eng	They're trying to reach you.
5736369	eng	They're not coming after us.
5736371	eng	They're going to torture us.
5736372	eng	They're entitled to do that.
5736374	eng	They're coming for you next.
5736375	eng	They're all covered in dust.
5736377	eng	They'll come looking for me.
5736378	eng	They'll be coming after you.
5736379	eng	Tom was screaming and crying.
5736380	eng	They were the perfect match.
5736382	eng	Tom was scared but uninjured.
5736383	eng	They stayed where they were.
5736389	eng	They look like best friends.
5736390	eng	They have their own demands.
5736395	eng	They don't answer to anyone.
5736396	eng	They clearly pose no threat.
5736398	eng	They can't track us anymore.
5736399	eng	They always manage to adapt.
5736401	eng	These things can't be cheap.
5736402	eng	There's plenty to go around.
5736404	eng	There's nothing you can say.
5736411	eng	There's never a dull moment.
5736413	eng	There will be some adapting.
5736414	eng	There will be no extensions.
5736417	eng	There was lots of screaming.
5736420	eng	There is a good explanation.
5736422	eng	There have been no setbacks.
5736425	eng	There are no second chances.
5736428	eng	The world changes every day.
5736429	eng	The whole world is laughing.
5736430	eng	Tom was feeling pretty cocky.
5736431	eng	The whole place has changed.
5736432	eng	The threat no longer exists.
5736434	eng	The test came back negative.
5736435	eng	The suspects fled the scene.
5736438	eng	The story doesn't end there.
5736439	eng	Tom was charged with robbery.
5736440	eng	The school is taking action.
5736442	eng	Tom was charged with assault.
5736444	eng	The reason is pretty simple.
5736446	eng	The profits can be enormous.
5736449	eng	The pools have been drained.
5736452	eng	The phone call was recorded.
5736455	eng	The night is just beginning.
5736456	eng	The nagging question is why.
5736458	eng	The monks continued to pray.
5736461	eng	The job market is improving.
5736464	eng	The game wasn't fun anymore.
5736465	eng	The facts will surprise you.
5736468	eng	The doctors didn't know why.
5736472	eng	Tom was an extraordinary man.
5736473	eng	The definitive answer is no.
5736474	eng	The damage is too extensive.
5736475	eng	Tom was an accomplished poet.
5736476	eng	The crowd continued to jeer.
5736477	eng	The court denied the appeal.
5736484	eng	Tom was absent without leave.
5736485	eng	The compensation is too low.
5736487	eng	Tom was a little disgruntled.
5736489	eng	The case hasn't been solved.
5736491	eng	The campaign ends on Monday.
5736492	eng	The briefing will start now.
5736494	eng	The blood test was negative.
5736496	eng	Tom wants to improve himself.
5736498	eng	That's what this city needs.
5736500	eng	That's what the world needs.
5736501	eng	That's what the fans wanted.
5736503	eng	That's what makes them good.
5736504	eng	That's what I'm praying for.
5736505	eng	Tom wanted his children back.
5736506	eng	That's the point I'm making.
5736507	eng	That's not the case anymore.
5736509	eng	That's not hard to envision.
5736512	eng	That's not a trick question.
5736513	eng	That's in our best interest.
5736515	eng	That's how the system works.
5736516	eng	That's how our system works.
5736518	eng	That's how I started boxing.
5736519	eng	That's all a little strange.
5736521	eng	That would've been too much.
5736522	eng	That would definitely do it.
5736524	eng	That wasn't the best answer.
5736525	eng	That wasn't always the case.
5736527	eng	That was your first mistake.
5736528	eng	That was very well executed.
5736529	eng	Tom survived the plane crash.
5736531	eng	That was my major complaint.
5736533	eng	That was my first challenge.
5736534	eng	That was difficult at first.
5736535	eng	Tom speaks without an accent.
5736536	eng	That was an awesome feeling.
5736537	eng	That was an amazing feeling.
5736540	eng	That was a unique situation.
5736542	eng	That was a lost opportunity.
5736543	eng	That moment changed my life.
5736545	eng	That isn't a terrible thing.
5736546	eng	That has since been changed.
5736549	eng	Thanks very much in advance.
5736550	eng	Tom screamed out Mary's name.
5736551	eng	Thanks for all your insight.
5736552	eng	Thanks for all the memories.
5736554	eng	Taxation is a serious issue.
5736555	eng	Take care of your customers.
5736557	eng	Surely, you can't mean that.
5736558	eng	Such people must be stopped.
5736561	eng	Step away from the controls.
5736564	eng	Some are better than others.
5736566	eng	So, is everyone happier now?
5736567	eng	So who is more conservative?
5736569	eng	Sleep came many hours later.
5736570	eng	See you for dinner tomorrow.
5736575	eng	Racism today isn't so overt.
5736579	eng	Please switch off the light.
5736580	eng	Tom refused to accept defeat.
5736581	eng	Please give us some insight.
5736582	eng	Please excuse my bad French.
5736584	eng	Please always wear a helmet.
5736585	eng	People will lose their jobs.
5736586	eng	Tom quit smoking cold turkey.
5736589	eng	Tom pulled the curtain aside.
5736593	eng	People are too stressed out.
5736594	eng	People are talking about it.
5736597	eng	People are starting to look.
5736599	eng	Participate any way you can.
5736601	eng	Tom pitched the third inning.
5736602	eng	Our original plan will work.
5736603	eng	Our laws have been violated.
5736605	eng	Only one answer makes sense.
5736608	eng	OK, you've got my attention.
5736609	eng	OK, take your blindfold off.
5736611	eng	Now you've got my attention.
5736612	eng	Now you're getting the idea.
5736614	eng	Now this is getting serious.
5736615	eng	Not one made the connection.
5736616	eng	Tom never returned to Boston.
5736618	eng	No one else recognized this.
5736619	eng	Tom never lost his composure.
5736621	eng	Much progress has been made.
5736623	eng	Motivation is a key element.
5736626	eng	Most people travel by train.
5736627	eng	Merry Christmas to you, too.
5736628	eng	Tom never could help himself.
5736629	eng	Mental illness is a disease.
5736630	eng	Meet me tomorrow for brunch.
5736632	eng	Maybe we should begin there.
5736633	eng	Many people support my work.
5736636	eng	Man, how times have changed.
5736637	eng	Tom needs to file bankruptcy.
5736638	eng	Makes you think, doesn't it?
5736639	eng	Life is returning to normal.
5736641	eng	Life is anything but normal.
5736642	eng	Life can be cruel sometimes.
5736643	eng	Tom must've lost his marbles.
5736644	eng	Let's make a final decision.
5736656	eng	It's very nice and peaceful.
5736657	eng	It's supposed to be natural.
5736659	eng	It's starting to smell nice.
5736660	eng	It's starting to look awful.
5736662	eng	It's sad that this happened.
5736663	eng	It's quite a dangerous road.
5736665	eng	It's nothing more than that.
5736666	eng	It's not worth the headache.
5736667	eng	Tom managed to elude capture.
5736668	eng	It's not an uncommon injury.
5736669	eng	It's never been about money.
5736671	eng	It's located on Park Street.
5736672	eng	It's like a childhood dream.
5736673	eng	Tom made Mary feel beautiful.
5736674	eng	It's just good common sense.
5736675	eng	It's just an everyday thing.
5736677	eng	It's hardly an idle concern.
5736678	eng	It's difficult to deal with.
5736679	eng	Tom looks like a millionaire.
5736680	eng	It's clearly made you angry.
5736681	eng	It's always about the money.
5736683	eng	It's also written in French.
5736684	eng	It's all been very positive.
5736686	eng	It's all been very humbling.
5736687	eng	It's all about your choices.
5736689	eng	It's a very traumatic thing.
5736690	eng	It's a very quiet community.
5736691	eng	Tom looked at Mary's drawing.
5736692	eng	It's a much better approach.
5736693	eng	It'll be good for everybody.
5736695	eng	It'll be an impossible task.
5736696	eng	It'll be a little different.
5736698	eng	It'll also help create jobs.
5736699	eng	It wasn't possible to study.
5736701	eng	It wasn't a rushed decision.
5736702	eng	It was very touching indeed.
5736703	eng	Tom left the box unprotected.
5736704	eng	It was my final performance.
5736706	eng	Tom left no witnesses behind.
5736707	eng	It was an incredible moment.
5736713	eng	It was a justified shooting.
5736714	eng	It was a frustrating ordeal.
5736716	eng	It took place around midday.
5736718	eng	Tom leaves nothing to chance.
5736719	eng	It has always been accepted.
5736720	eng	It feels good to contribute.
5736721	eng	Tom later returned to Boston.
5736722	eng	It does get their attention.
5736725	eng	It becomes a vicious circle.
5736727	eng	Tom lacks empathy for others.
5736728	eng	Is that a reasonable number?
5736729	eng	Is any money changing hands?
5736733	eng	Tom knows something about it.
5736737	eng	I've never missed a payment.
5736743	eng	I've cut back on everything.
5736745	eng	Tom knocked his opponent out.
5736751	eng	Tom just kept challenging me.
5736756	eng	I'm sticking to the routine.
5737057	eng	Tom isn't up for re-election.
5737064	eng	I'm open to any opportunity.
5737066	eng	Tom isn't making any excuses.
5737067	eng	I'm not the best songwriter.
5737069	eng	Tom isn't facing any charges.
5737071	eng	I'm new to the neighborhood.
5737072	eng	Tom isn't a diligent student.
5737073	eng	I'm marrying my best friend.
5737075	eng	Tom isn't a Democrat anymore.
5737080	eng	I'm here to play basketball.
5737090	eng	Tom is roasting coffee beans.
5737091	eng	I'm getting better each day.
5737092	eng	I'm getting a second chance.
5737094	eng	I'm feeling a little frisky.
5737096	eng	Tom is preparing for college.
5737097	eng	I'm demanding, but I'm fair.
5737098	eng	I'm anything but an elitist.
5737099	eng	Tom is making good decisions.
5737101	eng	I'm a very important person.
5737104	eng	I'll take one more question.
5737109	eng	I'll never buy another Ford.
5737110	eng	I'll never ask for clemency.
5737112	eng	I'll just have tomato juice.
5737113	eng	I'll issue my own challenge.
5737114	eng	Tom is having major problems.
5737124	eng	I wouldn't guarantee it yet.
5737125	eng	I wouldn't choose this life.
5737126	eng	Tom is getting the groceries.
5737127	eng	I wouldn't call them idiots.
5737131	eng	I would definitely say that.
5737132	eng	Tom is entirely welcome here.
5737144	eng	Tom is bright and articulate.
5737145	eng	I wasn't getting any better.
5737147	eng	Tom is breathing pretty hard.
5737168	eng	Tom is an unmanageable child.
5737171	eng	Tom is an outstanding player.
5737172	eng	I understood all that stuff.
5737173	eng	I understand what they want.
5737177	eng	Tom is a world-famous writer.
5737182	eng	I think it's inevitable now.
5737198	eng	Tom is a successful novelist.
5737199	eng	I should apologize for that.
5737201	eng	Tom is a professional driver.
5737202	eng	I saw what happened clearly.
5737205	eng	I recommend it to everybody.
5737206	eng	I really think they're good.
5737208	eng	I really didn't even notice.
5737213	eng	Tom is a family psychologist.
5737214	eng	I never forgot those things.
5737216	eng	Tom is a criminal mastermind.
5737218	eng	I myself am very frustrated.
5737222	eng	Tom is a brilliant economist.
5737236	eng	I just found that offensive.
5737247	eng	I heard someone yell "Help!"
5737248	eng	I haven't the remotest idea.
5737250	eng	I haven't really been there.
5737251	eng	I haven't committed a crime.
5737254	eng	I have a permanent contract.
5737292	eng	I had a profound experience.
5737294	eng	Tom hasn't visited this year.
5737297	eng	Tom hasn't seen anything yet.
5737299	eng	I grew up watching football.
5737300	eng	Tom hasn't killed anyone yet.
5737308	eng	I found that very unnatural.
5737309	eng	Tom has three older siblings.
5737310	eng	I found that very rewarding.
5737311	eng	I found it very interesting.
5737313	eng	I focused on getting better.
5737314	eng	I find that very unsettling.
5737316	eng	I find that very refreshing.
5737317	eng	I find it highly suspicious.
5737321	eng	Tom has no permanent address.
5737329	eng	I feel exactly the opposite.
5737332	eng	I enjoy watching dog racing.
5737336	eng	Tom has more ambitious plans.
5737342	eng	Tom has just entered college.
5737344	eng	I don't like American music.
5737345	eng	Tom has been very consistent.
5737357	eng	Tom has a comfortable income.
5737372	eng	Tom had no apparent injuries.
5737373	eng	I couldn't have imagined it.
5737377	eng	I can't take this seriously.
5737382	eng	I can't describe my sadness.
5737384	eng	Tom had a similar experience.
5737387	eng	Tom had a different strategy.
5737389	eng	I came here seeking justice.
5737390	eng	Tom grew up playing baseball.
5737409	eng	I absolutely love this song.
5737410	eng	How's the weather right now?
5737412	eng	How is this still happening?
5737413	eng	How embarrassing for us all.
5737415	eng	How does one celebrate that?
5737416	eng	How dangerous would this be?
5737418	eng	How can anyone be satisfied?
5737419	eng	Here's where you went wrong.
5737421	eng	Have you worked hard enough?
5737422	eng	Have you ever been deported?
5737423	eng	Tom failed the entrance exam.
5737424	eng	Have a great weekend, folks.
5737425	eng	Has this tactic ever worked?
5737426	eng	Tom emerged from the shadows.
5737427	eng	Grades are a necessary evil.
5737428	eng	Give people a second chance.
5737429	eng	Tom emerged from the kitchen.
5737430	eng	Girls walk sooner than boys.
5737433	eng	For me, it's not acceptable.
5737434	eng	Football is a violent sport.
5737435	eng	Tom drives me totally insane.
5737436	eng	Food will also be available.
5737440	eng	Everything is give and take.
5737442	eng	Everyone is welcome to join.
5737443	eng	Everyone is looking to help.
5737444	eng	Tom doesn't have that luxury.
5737445	eng	Everyone has been so lovely.
5737448	eng	Every little bit has helped.
5737451	eng	Don't throw away your money.
5737458	eng	Do you remember this bridge?
5737462	eng	Tom didn't turn anybody down.
5737464	eng	Diplomas used to have value.
5737466	eng	Did anybody see this coming?
5737469	eng	Costs were through the roof.
5737471	eng	Tom didn't reveal his secret.
5737473	eng	Come to your own conclusion.
5737474	eng	Tom didn't provide an answer.
5737475	eng	Come to my quarters tonight.
5737476	eng	Come on, somebody answer me.
5737479	eng	Caviar is an acquired taste.
5737481	eng	Can you suggest some titles?
5737485	eng	Can we expect anything else?
5737486	eng	Tom didn't express any anger.
5737487	eng	CBS should cancel this show.
5737488	eng	Boy, how times have changed.
5737489	eng	Tom didn't earn those awards.
5737490	eng	Both teams are very similar.
5737494	eng	Ask someone else besides me.
5737496	eng	Are you getting the picture?
5737497	eng	Are you a religious fanatic?
5737498	eng	Tom didn't admit to anything.
5737502	eng	Are racist comments ever OK?
5737509	eng	A girl was attacked tonight.
5737510	eng	Tom developed his own theory.
5737511	eng	Your argument has no merit.
5737512	eng	You're so young and pretty.
5737513	eng	Tom destroyed his own family.
5737514	eng	You're so behind the times.
5737517	eng	You're making us all proud.
5737518	eng	You're going to be pleased.
5737520	eng	You're a real stand-up guy.
5737523	eng	You probably know the rest.
5737524	eng	You people are so ignorant.
5737526	eng	You people are really mean.
5737527	eng	You must've hurt your foot.
5737530	eng	You made the best decision.
5737533	eng	You know that's just wrong.
5737534	eng	Tom definitely helped us win.
5737535	eng	You don't have to struggle.
5737536	eng	You can't argue against it.
5737537	eng	Tom declined to confirm that.
5737539	eng	You aren't smarter than us.
5737541	eng	You ain't seen nothin' yet.
5737544	eng	Will there be side effects?
5737545	eng	Why would I feel different?
5737547	eng	Why would I bother working?
5737548	eng	Why should it be dangerous?
5737550	eng	Why is this time different?
5737551	eng	Why is that sometimes hard?
5737554	eng	Who's looking out for them?
5737555	eng	Tom could have other worries.
5737557	eng	Who will ask the questions?
5737559	eng	Who was behind the attacks?
5737560	eng	Who didn't see this coming?
5737562	eng	Where does bacon come from?
5737563	eng	When will enough be enough?
5737566	eng	What's with all the bricks?
5737567	eng	Tom confessed to both crimes.
5737568	eng	What's the world coming to?
5737569	eng	What's it like there today?
5737570	eng	Tom complained of a headache.
5737571	eng	What's happened to my baby?
5737572	eng	What's broken can be fixed.
5737574	eng	What you lack is technique.
5737575	eng	What would be the surprise?
5737577	eng	What were they thinking of?
5737578	eng	What was the priest's name?
5737581	eng	What happened to the goats?
5737584	eng	What converter did you get?
5737587	eng	What are you responding to?
5737589	eng	What are you implying here?
5737590	eng	What are you curious about?
5737592	eng	Well, I'm just checking in.
5737593	eng	We've worked hard for this.
5737595	eng	We've never made any money.
5737601	eng	We've got a situation here.
5737602	eng	We've come to a standstill.
5737603	eng	Tom calls himself a hobbyist.
5737605	eng	We're very happy with that.
5737609	eng	Tom built his own motorcycle.
5737612	eng	Tom bought cocaine from Mary.
5737614	eng	We're still sorting it out.
5737615	eng	Tom bludgeoned Mary to death.
5737621	eng	Tom began to breathe heavily.
5737622	eng	We're not happy about this.
5737624	eng	Tom became unsure and afraid.
5737629	eng	We're hoping to avoid that.
5737632	eng	We're doing more with less.
5737636	eng	Tom approached them for help.
5737642	eng	Tom and Mary were victorious.
5737644	eng	We'll return to this later.
5737653	eng	We wouldn't bet against it.
5737658	eng	We were doing it backwards.
5737660	eng	Tom always plans the attacks.
5737667	eng	We understand what we need.
5737669	eng	Tom always knows what's what.
5737670	eng	We simply don't believe it.
5737676	eng	We provided them with food.
5737678	eng	Tom accused me of negligence.
5737682	eng	We need those three things.
5737684	eng	Those were Tom's final words.
5737696	eng	The three girls followed Tom.
5737699	eng	The shot fatally wounded Tom.
5737705	eng	That's Tom in the background.
5737706	eng	We have too much inventory.
5737711	eng	Nothing else mattered to Tom.
5737716	eng	We have everything to gain.
5737717	eng	Mary said she isn't pregnant.
5737718	eng	We do have some challenges.
5737721	eng	We didn't bother going out.
5737724	eng	We can manage without that.
5737725	eng	We can change this country.
5737730	eng	Wait until the dust clears.
5737731	eng	Visits are by appointment only.
5737734	eng	Those were very good times.
5737736	eng	This year is quite unusual.
5737739	eng	This will remain a problem.
5737740	eng	This will make us stronger.
5737743	eng	This really helps our kids.
5737746	eng	This problem won't go away.
5737748	eng	This isn't a trivial point.
5737749	eng	This isn't a paid position.
5737751	eng	This is the absolute truth.
5737757	eng	This is getting really old.
5737758	eng	This is an unexpected turn.
5737760	eng	This is an ongoing process.
5737761	eng	This is an amazing feeling.
5737762	eng	Is Tom different than before?
5737763	eng	This is an absurd decision.
5737764	eng	This is a direct challenge.
5737765	eng	I've avoided speaking to Tom.
5737766	eng	This is a curious argument.
5737767	eng	This is a crucial question.
5737769	eng	This is a constant problem.
5737770	eng	This could've been my life.
5737773	eng	This caught us by surprise.
5737776	eng	Things were kind of freaky.
5737778	eng	Things need to settle down.
5737779	eng	Things like this are great.
5737781	eng	Things are tough out there.
5737782	eng	Things are pretty grim now.
5737785	eng	They're trying to steal it.
5737787	eng	They're there for a reason.
5737788	eng	They're not the same thing.
5737790	eng	They're armed to the teeth.
5737791	eng	They're a good hockey team.
5737792	eng	I would absolutely trust Tom.
5737793	eng	They'll help us get better.
5737794	eng	They were yelling for help.
5737797	eng	They were looking for jobs.
5737800	eng	They were covered in blood.
5737801	eng	I thought Tom was unbeatable.
5737803	eng	They were all good stories.
5737805	eng	They waited for a decision.
5737806	eng	They succeeded for a while.
5737807	eng	I think Tom looks incredible.
5737809	eng	They never got that chance.
5737811	eng	They need to cancel school.
5737812	eng	They kept that thing quiet.
5737814	eng	They have an open marriage.
5737815	eng	They have a strong program.
5737821	eng	These are the simple rules.
5737824	eng	There's no way around that.
5737826	eng	There's no secret about it.
5737827	eng	There's no reason for that.
5737829	eng	There's no free lunch here.
5737830	eng	There's a lot of potential.
5737832	eng	There will be traffic jams.
5737833	eng	There will be no surprises.
5737835	eng	There will be no ambiguity.
5737838	eng	There were no side effects.
5737841	eng	There wasn't any room left.
5737842	eng	There was obviously a need.
5737844	eng	There was nothing at stake.
5737845	eng	There was a child involved.
5737847	eng	There is no short-term fix.
5737848	eng	There is no fixed calendar.
5737854	eng	Their gang color is purple.
5737857	eng	The wounds are still fresh.
5737859	eng	The world will be watching.
5737860	eng	The war can't last forever.
5737865	eng	The suspense is killing us.
5737866	eng	The suspense is killing me.
5737868	eng	The strategy is paying off.
5737871	eng	The stock market is insane.
5737874	eng	The snow continued to fall.
5737877	eng	The shelf is jammed packed.
5737878	eng	The season isn't over with.
5737880	eng	The process can take years.
5737881	eng	The problem is the economy.
5737883	eng	The press will be watching.
5737884	eng	The precedent has been set.
5737885	eng	You'd probably vote for Tom.
5737886	eng	The police have taken over.
5737887	eng	The police can't stop this.
5737889	eng	The plane has touched down.
5737893	eng	The opposite is often true.
5737894	eng	Why is Tom challenging Mary?
5737896	eng	The new iPads look amazing.
5737898	eng	The majority is against it.
5737900	eng	What's Tom's golf game like?
5737901	eng	The law isn't always right.
5737902	eng	The law is perfectly clear.
5737903	eng	What were Tom's exact words?
5737905	eng	The jury had three options.
5737906	eng	What makes Tom's so awesome?
5737907	eng	The innkeeper is very nice.
5737910	eng	The idea was simple enough.
5737911	eng	The guards are in position.
5737912	eng	What Tom found was shocking.
5737915	eng	We're really upset with Tom.
5737917	eng	The fans have been amazing.
5737919	eng	The evening's not over yet.
5737920	eng	The enemy just kept coming.
5737927	eng	We couldn't leave Tom there.
5737929	eng	The deadline came and went.
5737933	eng	Tom's stuff was really good.
5737934	eng	The damage control is easy.
5737935	eng	The country needs a change.
5737938	eng	The challenge now is clear.
5737940	eng	The boys continued to fish.
5737941	eng	The big day is approaching.
5737942	eng	Tom's shoes can't be filled.
5737943	eng	The band continued to play.
5737944	eng	The answer is a no-brainer.
5737946	eng	The analysis is very clear.
5737949	eng	That's usually how it goes.
5737952	eng	That's the worst I've seen.
5737953	eng	That's the real need there.
5737955	eng	That's the gamble you take.
5737956	eng	That's not really worth it.
5737958	eng	That would shake things up.
5737967	eng	That teacher isn't too bad.
5737968	eng	That task hasn't been easy.
5737973	eng	That made my decision easy.
5737976	eng	That has now been achieved.
5737979	eng	That danger can be averted.
5737981	eng	Tom's body was found Monday.
5737982	eng	Thank you for your insight.
5737984	eng	Tom's back isn't doing well.
5737988	eng	Step away from the vehicle.
5737989	eng	Stay away from sick people.
5737991	eng	Tom works in the laboratory.
5737993	eng	Sometimes you need a break.
5737995	eng	Something else is going on.
5737998	eng	Some people are so uptight.
5737999	eng	So, what were the problems?
5738001	eng	So much has happened there.
5738003	eng	Tom works across the border.
5738006	eng	Tom worked until he dropped.
5738007	eng	Racists come in all colors.
5738008	eng	Please stick to the issues.
5738009	eng	Tom worked harder than ever.
5738012	eng	Tom worked hard this winter.
5738013	eng	Please give me some advice.
5738016	eng	Perhaps we can be forgiven.
5738017	eng	People took to the streets.
5738018	eng	Tom won't make that mistake.
5738020	eng	People ran for their lives.
5738021	eng	Tom won't go into specifics.
5738023	eng	People are going to notice.
5738033	eng	Tom will be released Monday.
5738035	eng	Now who is being dishonest?
5738038	eng	No questions will be asked.
5738040	eng	No one was above suspicion.
5738041	eng	No formal action was taken.
5738043	eng	No dogs or alcohol allowed.
5738044	eng	New housing is being built.
5738046	eng	My, how times have changed.
5738047	eng	My children are growing up.
5738049	eng	My children are adults now.
5738054	eng	Tom watched the whole thing.
5738060	eng	Tom wasn't feeling too good.
5738062	eng	Let's get the ball rolling.
5738065	eng	Just be careful down there.
5738066	eng	Tom wasn't always like that.
5738067	eng	It's the best feeling ever.
5738068	eng	It's simply out of control.
5738070	eng	It's only been three years.
5738071	eng	It's not easy getting here.
5738073	eng	It's not attractive at all.
5738074	eng	It's not a debatable issue.
5738075	eng	Tom was waiting for someone.
5738076	eng	It's going very, very well.
5738077	eng	It's always the same story.
5738078	eng	Tom was unwilling to change.
5738079	eng	It's a very well-made film.
5738080	eng	It's a tough balancing act.
5738082	eng	It would never be condoned.
5738084	eng	Tom was tried and convicted.
5738085	eng	It was constructed in 2013.
5738087	eng	Tom was tried and acquitted.
5738090	eng	Tom was trembling with fear.
5738091	eng	It just can't happen again.
5738092	eng	It hasn't changed one iota.
5738097	eng	It always starts like this.
5738100	eng	Is that what you're saying?
5738101	eng	Is such an attack possible?
5738102	eng	Tom was stunned, but elated.
5738103	eng	I've heard of it happening.
5738104	eng	I've got some great photos.
5738106	eng	I've given you your orders.
5738107	eng	I've been puzzling over it.
5738108	eng	Tom was shot multiple times.
5738114	eng	Tom was reluctant to answer.
5738116	eng	I'm very thankful for this.
5738117	eng	Tom was relieved of command.
5738121	eng	I'm up for any suggestions.
5738124	eng	I'm still kind of unnerved.
5738128	eng	I'm serious about this one.
5738130	eng	I'm really thankful for it.
5738131	eng	I'm not offended by anyone.
5738132	eng	Tom was much more pragmatic.
5738133	eng	I'm not making any excuses.
5738135	eng	Tom was more than intrigued.
5738138	eng	Tom was looking quite happy.
5738139	eng	I'm just sorry it happened.
5738143	eng	I'm investing in my future.
5738144	eng	Tom was like that sometimes.
5738147	eng	Tom was less than convinced.
5738148	eng	I'm happy it happened here.
5738157	eng	I'm doing a school project.
5738159	eng	Tom was indicted last month.
5738160	eng	I'm counting down the days.
5738164	eng	I'm attempting to win here.
5738166	eng	I'm also thinking about us.
5738168	eng	Tom was executed soon after.
5738171	eng	Tom was elected three times.
5738177	eng	Tom was convicted of murder.
5738184	eng	I'd like to celebrate that.
5738185	eng	I wonder what started this.
5738186	eng	Tom was against hiring Mary.
5738189	eng	Tom was accompanied by Mary.
5738192	eng	Tom was absorbed in thought.
5738194	eng	I was riding my motorcycle.
5738201	eng	Tom was a true professional.
5738202	eng	I was hoping they'd forget.
5738204	eng	Tom was a spiritual adviser.
5738207	eng	Tom was a consensus builder.
5738231	eng	Tom walked along the street.
5738236	eng	I stand by that commitment.
5738237	eng	Tom turned pale with fright.
5738239	eng	I see it quite differently.
5738240	eng	Tom turned down my proposal.
5738241	eng	I saw the building burning.
5738242	eng	I regard that as necessary.
5738248	eng	I played really well today.
5738251	eng	I never regretted doing it.
5738253	eng	I mean that very sincerely.
5738254	eng	I make allowances for that.
5738257	eng	I love everything about it.
5738259	eng	I looked around the garage.
5738260	eng	I like to repurpose things.
5738261	eng	Tom took a courageous stand.
5738262	eng	I like having a girlfriend.
5738268	eng	I knew it wasn't fireworks.
5738271	eng	I just want a championship.
5738276	eng	Tom struggled to break free.
5738279	eng	Tom stopped talking to Mary.
5738280	eng	I hope they're found alive.
5738284	eng	I haven't heard that story.
5738285	eng	Tom stood behind his mother.
5738288	eng	Tom started to speak French.
5738292	eng	I had nightmares for weeks.
5738295	eng	I guess times are changing.
5738303	eng	Tom showed signs of fatigue.
5738304	eng	I found that very alarming.
5738305	eng	I find it very stimulating.
5738307	eng	I find it very encouraging.
5738324	eng	Tom returned safe and sound.
5738329	eng	I don't think it's serious.
5738331	eng	I don't recognize that bum.
5738333	eng	Tom refused to believe Mary.
5738335	eng	I don't know what's coming.
5738338	eng	I don't blame anybody else.
5738347	eng	I didn't have any training.
5738348	eng	Tom proposed giving a party.
5738351	eng	Tom pressed the brake pedal.
5738352	eng	I definitely needed a plan.
5738353	eng	I deeply care about people.
5738355	eng	I couldn't choose just one.
5738356	eng	I could've caught that bus.
5738357	eng	Tom owns lots of properties.
5738358	eng	I could see that happening.
5738359	eng	I consider myself an idiot.
5738361	eng	I can't stress this enough.
5738362	eng	I can't stress that enough.
5738363	eng	Tom obviously wants to play.
5738369	eng	I beg for your forgiveness.
5738372	eng	I already knew the outcome.
5738376	eng	How would define this word?
5738378	eng	How will the markets react?
5738379	eng	How much will surgery cost?
5738380	eng	Tom must've retired or died.
5738381	eng	How do you define progress?
5738383	eng	Tom must've been tipped off.
5738384	eng	How did your journey begin?
5738385	eng	How could I feign surprise?
5738387	eng	How are they all connected?
5738388	eng	Have you ever smoked crack?
5738390	eng	Have they lost their minds?
5738393	eng	Get yourself taken care of.
5738394	eng	Gee, what a novel approach.
5738399	eng	Excuse us a moment, please.
5738407	eng	Tom may be very intelligent.
5738408	eng	Early detection is the key.
5738409	eng	Don't allow it to escalate.
5738410	eng	Tom may be better qualified.
5738411	eng	Do you think you're clever?
5738412	eng	Do you like being pampered?
5738415	eng	Did you witness the attack?
5738417	eng	Did everyone agree with it?
5738418	eng	Denial is a terrible thing.
5738419	eng	Tom made it look effortless.
5738421	eng	Could you be more concrete?
5738425	eng	Tom made Mary his secretary.
5738431	eng	Tom loved his mother dearly.
5738432	eng	Can you provide an example?
5738434	eng	Tom lost all his belongings.
5738435	eng	Can they compete next year?
5738436	eng	Both suspects fled on foot.
5738437	eng	Tom looked at Mary sideways.
5738440	eng	Tom lives beyond his income.
5738442	eng	Are your children grown up?
5738443	eng	Tom lived with the Jacksons.
5738444	eng	Are you an aspiring writer?
5738445	eng	Are there too many options?
5738446	eng	Tom lived a remarkable life.
5738448	eng	Allow at least three hours.
5738452	eng	Tom lifted his hat politely.
5738456	eng	You've had a great career.
5738461	eng	Tom knows that feeling well.
5738464	eng	Tom knows Boston inside out.
5738466	eng	You make some good points.
5738468	eng	You make many good points.
5738469	eng	You have it exactly right.
5738470	eng	Tom just wants some answers.
5738472	eng	Wow, what a vicious cycle.
5738474	eng	Would you care to expound?
5738476	eng	Tom just sat there grinning.
5738477	eng	Will it ever stop raining?
5738478	eng	Will it ever stop hurting?
5738479	eng	Tom just doesn't look right.
5738480	eng	Why would we celebrate it?
5738481	eng	Why have they attacked us?
5738482	eng	Tom just can't help himself.
5738483	eng	Why aren't you moving yet?
5738484	eng	Why are they so different?
5738486	eng	Why are they attacking me?
5738487	eng	Why am I being persecuted?
5738489	eng	Who was minding the store?
5738490	eng	Who can tolerate all this?
5738492	eng	Where would you have gone?
5738493	eng	What's wrong with my legs?
5738495	eng	What's the game plan here?
5738496	eng	What's all the buzz about?
5738499	eng	What tools can you afford?
5738501	eng	What problems do you have?
5738507	eng	What do you remember most?
5738513	eng	What could this even mean?
5738514	eng	Well, that could be tough.
5738518	eng	Tom is still under contract.
5738521	eng	Tom is still awaiting trial.
5738523	eng	We've been affected a lot.
5738524	eng	Tom is running for governor.
5738525	eng	We've all had our moments.
5738527	eng	Tom is really into swimming.
5738528	eng	We're very happy about it.
5738530	eng	Tom is part Native American.
5738534	eng	We're stuck in the middle.
5738537	eng	We're still in good shape.
5738538	eng	We're still excited by it.
5738541	eng	We're part of the problem.
5738544	eng	We're not committed to it.
5738547	eng	We're looking into it, OK?
5738548	eng	Tom is just so approachable.
5738549	eng	We're in the home stretch.
5738551	eng	Tom is infatuated with Mary.
5738552	eng	We're in a tough position.
5738559	eng	We're all tired of losing.
5738560	eng	Tom is in army intelligence.
5738562	eng	We're afraid of the water.
5738564	eng	We're a very poor country.
5738570	eng	We'll know in the morning.
5738572	eng	Tom is devastated right now.
5738577	eng	We won't ever abandon you.
5738579	eng	We won't be pushed around.
5738583	eng	We were never ever hungry.
5738585	eng	We were all always hungry.
5738586	eng	We were ahead of everyone.
5738587	eng	Tom is an incredible person.
5738589	eng	We want to stick together.
5738689	eng	Tom is an exemplary husband.
5738691	eng	We want to hire Americans.
5738694	eng	We took it very seriously.
5738696	eng	We told them to surrender.
5738697	eng	We thought the same thing.
5738702	eng	We started all over again.
5738703	eng	We should lead by example.
5738704	eng	Tom is a passionate teacher.
5738714	eng	We need spending cuts now.
5738721	eng	We love each other dearly.
5738725	eng	Tom is a building inspector.
5738726	eng	We just talked last night.
5738727	eng	We judge people every day.
5738729	eng	We haven't yet hit bottom.
5738733	eng	We have learned from them.
5738736	eng	We have a three-game lead.
5738740	eng	Tom hastily packed his bags.
5738741	eng	We feel we're good enough.
5738743	eng	Tom hasn't yet been charged.
5738746	eng	Tom hasn't returned to work.
5738747	eng	We didn't play well today.
5739199	eng	We could do something big.
5739200	eng	We consider it a blessing.
5739201	eng	Tom hasn't been spotted yet.
5739204	eng	Tom hasn't been charged yet.
5739206	eng	We can't control all that.
5739209	eng	We aren't grown up enough.
5739212	eng	Waiter, bring me a double.
5739216	eng	Tom has time for everything.
5739219	eng	Tom has three mobile phones.
5739220	eng	Three weeks and we're off.
5739221	eng	Those two have a daughter.
5739223	eng	Those are pretty bad odds.
5739228	eng	Tom has such beautiful eyes.
5739229	eng	This isn't a fair boycott.
5739230	eng	This isn't a complex case.
5739232	eng	This is the basic problem.
5739235	eng	This is pure spring water.
5739239	eng	This is an immense relief.
5739242	eng	This is a double standard.
5739244	eng	Things are going good now.
5739245	eng	They're very much in love.
5739247	eng	They're pretty good at it.
5739248	eng	They're not going to quit.
5739250	eng	They're all back on track.
5739251	eng	They'll have to accept it.
5739255	eng	Tom has always been focused.
5739329	eng	They shared a unique bond.
5739335	eng	They have reason to worry.
5739337	eng	They have all the answers.
5739340	eng	They had a campsite there.
5739341	eng	They eat meat on occasion.
5739343	eng	They don't need to change.
5739344	eng	They didn't catch the bus.
5739345	eng	Tom has a great personality.
5739351	eng	Tom has a different opinion.
5739353	eng	There's no room for doubt.
5739356	eng	There's a reason for this.
5739357	eng	Tom had to politely decline.
5739361	eng	There was never a problem.
5739364	eng	There aren't enough of us.
5739365	eng	There are too many doubts.
5739367	eng	There are no winners here.
5739368	eng	There are no secrets here.
5739369	eng	Tom had one younger brother.
5739370	eng	Then the railing gave way.
5739374	eng	The years went by quickly.
5739375	eng	Tom had an exceptional year.
5739377	eng	The waves were very rough.
5739379	eng	The war is escalating now.
5739382	eng	The vaccine has no effect.
5739384	eng	Tom had a healthy childhood.
5739385	eng	The truth is the opposite.
5739517	eng	Tom grew up speaking French.
5739518	eng	The trend is clear enough.
5739523	eng	Tom gets angry quite easily.
5739525	eng	The suspects fled on foot.
5739527	eng	The suspect has dark hair.
5739528	eng	The spell has been broken.
5739529	eng	Tom finally broke the horse.
5739533	eng	The silence is killing me.
5739534	eng	The room has been trashed.
5739535	eng	Tom faces a challenging job.
5739537	eng	The question is, will you?
5739538	eng	Tom faces a burglary charge.
5739539	eng	The question is, where to?
5739540	eng	The public will accept it.
5739547	eng	Tom doesn't have a favorite.
5739549	eng	The polar bears are dying.
5739550	eng	Tom doesn't cut any corners.
5739554	eng	The park is closed Monday.
5739558	eng	The money was never found.
5739561	eng	The message is very clear.
5739562	eng	The hiring freeze is over.
5739563	eng	Tom didn't worry about that.
5739564	eng	The healing can now begin.
5739569	eng	Tom didn't return our calls.
5739571	eng	The first claim is untrue.
5739572	eng	Tom didn't quite trust Mary.
5739573	eng	The election is on Monday.
5739574	eng	The door is slightly ajar.
5739576	eng	The dog continued to bark.
5739651	eng	Tom didn't know his parents.
5739652	eng	The day started very well.
5739657	eng	Tom didn't even go upstairs.
5739658	eng	The climb took three days.
5739659	eng	The city is wasting money.
5739663	eng	Tom didn't commit the crime.
5739665	eng	The bottom line is safety.
5739668	eng	The body adapts to stress.
5739670	eng	The blast was very strong.
5739676	eng	That's when it gets tough.
5739677	eng	That's what this is about.
5739679	eng	That's what sets us apart.
5739680	eng	That's what it feels like.
5739681	eng	Tom created a terrible fuss.
5739683	eng	That's right on the money.
5739684	eng	Tom could make a difference.
5739685	eng	That's our plan right now.
5739686	eng	That's not the main issue.
5739691	eng	That's how we were raised.
5739692	eng	That's how it all started.
5739694	eng	That's exactly what I got.
5739697	eng	That's been my main focus.
5739698	eng	That's been known to work.
5739700	eng	That's a lesson I learned.
5739701	eng	That'll give us more time.
5739708	eng	Tom can't fix what's broken.
5739709	eng	That was my next question.
5739710	eng	That was far too dramatic.
5740533	eng	That was a rude awakening.
5740535	eng	That was a big difference.
5740536	eng	That seems a little shaky.
5740537	eng	Tom called for an ambulance.
5740538	eng	That scar will never heal.
5740543	eng	Tom attends school at night.
5740544	eng	That has really helped us.
5740547	eng	Thank you for not judging.
5740548	eng	Thank God everyone was OK.
5740549	eng	Tom appeared to be sleeping.
5740551	eng	Take care of your clothes.
5740552	eng	Tom appeared in court today.
5740553	eng	Take a chance on yourself.
5740557	eng	Sorry for the harsh words.
5740565	eng	Some people make me laugh.
5740566	eng	Some people are just dumb.
5740573	eng	Tom almost forgot his money.
5740574	eng	Safety is the bottom line.
5740575	eng	Riots broke out in Boston.
5740576	eng	Tom agreed on one condition.
5740579	eng	Tom accepted a plea bargain.
5740580	eng	Please show us your proof.
5740583	eng	Perhaps it can be avoided.
5740585	eng	There's no arguing with Tom.
5740587	eng	People need the money now.
5740591	eng	The gentleman's name is Tom.
5740592	eng	People are being laid off.
5740593	eng	Park Street is closed off.
5740594	eng	The food disagreed with Tom.
5740596	eng	Our doors are always open.
5740597	eng	That's the problem with Tom.
5740600	eng	Thank God Tom wasn't killed.
5740601	eng	Our car is being repaired.
5740602	eng	One year later we married.
5740605	eng	Oh, it's right over there.
5740606	eng	Put yourself in Tom's shoes.
5740608	eng	Nothing can bring me down.
5740609	eng	Mary's husband is named Tom.
5740610	eng	No, but thanks for asking.
5740611	eng	No one has been convicted.
5740613	eng	No more words were spoken.
5740614	eng	No date has been proposed.
5740620	eng	My position is very clear.
5740622	eng	My mouth was suddenly dry.
5740626	eng	My how times have changed.
5740631	eng	My eyesight must be going.
5740632	eng	My boys are my everything.
5740638	eng	Money can help, of course.
5740642	eng	I'm happy Tom survived that.
5740644	eng	Maybe you have bad breath.
5740645	eng	I'm Tom calling from Boston.
5740646	eng	Many were killed that day.
5740649	eng	Make sure you start small.
5740650	eng	Little dogs are the worst.
5740652	eng	Let's talk about the poor.
5740653	eng	Let's hope it stays there.
5740656	eng	Let's give them their due.
5740659	eng	Let's be clear about this.
5740661	eng	Let's be clear about that.
5740668	eng	Let me add my perspective.
5740670	eng	Kids make friends so fast.
5740671	eng	Just grab a seat anywhere.
5740673	eng	Jealousy is an ugly beast.
5740674	eng	It's yet to be determined.
5740676	eng	It's what I always wanted.
5740677	eng	It's very tough right now.
5740679	eng	It's such a special place.
5740680	eng	It's something new for me.
5740682	eng	It's pretty much the same.
5740683	eng	It's pretty much over now.
5740685	eng	It's not the only example.
5740686	eng	It's not an exact science.
5740688	eng	It's not an easy solution.
5740689	eng	It's not always about you.
5740691	eng	It's much better this way.
5740692	eng	It's just a weird feeling.
5740694	eng	It's hardly been a secret.
5740695	eng	It's harder than it seems.
5740697	eng	It's happening to me, too.
5740698	eng	It's going to snow Monday.
5740700	eng	It's going to get tougher.
5740703	eng	It's funny you should ask.
5740704	eng	It's easy to believe this.
5740707	eng	It's amazing how it works.
5740709	eng	It's always good to laugh.
5740710	eng	It's all about the timing.
5740712	eng	It's all about having fun.
5740713	eng	It's a whole new ballgame.
5740715	eng	It's a never ending cycle.
5740716	eng	It'll take care of itself.
5740718	eng	It'll probably be a while.
5740719	eng	It'll be a little cramped.
5740721	eng	It'll be a costly venture.
5740722	eng	It wasn't always that way.
5740723	eng	What's the latest with Tom?
5740726	eng	What'll Tom's next move be?
5740728	eng	It was purely by accident.
5740729	eng	What would Tom's motive be?
5740735	eng	What cost Tom the election?
5740736	eng	It was discovered in 2013.
5740737	eng	It was clearly off limits.
5740739	eng	It was an unjust sentence.
5740740	eng	It was an incredible shot.
5740741	eng	Were Tom and Mary together?
5740742	eng	It was an incredible game.
5740743	eng	It was all very traumatic.
5740745	eng	It was all very secretive.
5740746	eng	It was a wonderful finale.
5740747	eng	We'll always love you, Tom.
5740748	eng	It was a volunteer effort.
5740749	eng	It was a remarkable sight.
5740751	eng	It was a remarkable scene.
5740752	eng	It was a perfect location.
5740754	eng	It was a little different.
5740755	eng	It was a difficult period.
5740756	eng	Tom's work is widely cited.
5740757	eng	It was a difficult battle.
5740758	eng	It was a costly encounter.
5740759	eng	Tom's wife has been killed.
5740762	eng	Tom's throat had been slit.
5740763	eng	It rained very hard today.
5740764	eng	It proved to be effective.
5740765	eng	Tom's story is even better.
5740769	eng	It just takes one mistake.
5740770	eng	It just feels really good.
5740771	eng	Tom's real name is unknown.
5740772	eng	It hurts like the dickens.
5740773	eng	It has been life changing.
5740774	eng	Tom's last name is unknown.
5740775	eng	It has been an adjustment.
5740776	eng	It had the desired effect.
5740778	eng	It could not be otherwise.
5740782	eng	It can be exhausting work.
5740784	eng	Isn't this a serious flaw?
5740785	eng	Isn't that the whole idea?
5740786	eng	Tom's got a weight problem.
5740787	eng	Is this a common practice?
5740792	eng	Tom's death was a homicide.
5740793	eng	Is it football season yet?
5740794	eng	Is it different this time?
5740797	eng	If it happens, it happens.
5740801	eng	Tom won't last much longer.
5740803	eng	I've done that every year.
5740807	eng	Tom willingly went to jail.
5740808	eng	I've been selling my hair.
5740810	eng	Tom will remain in custody.
5740812	eng	I've always been a leader.
5740817	eng	I'm tired of hearing that.
5740820	eng	I'm sure this helped them.
5740821	eng	I'm sure that was helpful.
5740825	eng	Tom will be greatly missed.
5740826	eng	I'm retired and have time.
5740829	eng	I'm really hard on myself.
5740830	eng	I'm really happy for that.
5741119	eng	What is your personality type?
5741136	eng	I'm ready to support this.
5741137	eng	I'm ready to start Monday.
5741138	eng	Tom will be around forever.
5741139	eng	I'm quite humbled by that.
5741140	eng	I'm proud of this program.
5741141	eng	Tom will appeal the ruling.
5741142	eng	I'm proud of this country.
5741143	eng	I'm pretty hard on myself.
5741144	eng	Tom whipped out his pistol.
5741146	eng	I'm not to be interrupted.
5741147	eng	Tom went to get cigarettes.
5741149	eng	I'm not frustrated at all.
5741155	eng	I'm looking for the truth.
5741157	eng	I'm just letting you know.
5741159	eng	Tom waved in our direction.
5741160	eng	I'm in agreement with you.
5741161	eng	I'm here for the audition.
5741162	eng	Tom wasn't born a Canadian.
5741165	eng	Tom wasn't around for that.
5741166	eng	I'm going to kill someone.
5741168	eng	Tom wasn't a bit impatient.
5741172	eng	I'm glad they took action.
5741175	eng	I'm entitled to an answer.
5741179	eng	I'm ashamed to admit that.
5741181	eng	I'm an executive at heart.
5741188	eng	I'll buy a shirt tomorrow.
5741189	eng	Tom was their first choice.
5741190	eng	I'll ask you one question.
5741192	eng	Tom was the obvious choice.
5741194	eng	I wouldn't have risked it.
5741195	eng	Tom was the lone dissenter.
5741196	eng	I would totally love that.
5741197	eng	I wonder what that's like.
5741199	eng	I won't watch CNN anymore.
5741201	eng	Tom was the exact opposite.
5741209	eng	I was still feeling angry.
5741210	eng	Tom was seen stealing food.
5741213	eng	Tom was screaming for help.
5741214	eng	I was satisfied with that.
5741219	eng	Tom was raised around guns.
5741220	eng	I was just playing around.
5741222	eng	Tom was quite a ballplayer.
5741224	eng	I was frightened to death.
5741226	eng	I was forced to volunteer.
5741228	eng	Tom was open to everything.
5741229	eng	I wanted to be aggressive.
5741238	eng	I thought we were focused.
5741239	eng	I think we're pretty good.
5741243	eng	Tom was loved by everybody.
5741244	eng	I think the point's clear.
5741245	eng	I think it's coming along.
5741248	eng	I think it was terrifying.
5741255	eng	Tom was just being playful.
5741256	eng	I still can't really hear.
5741257	eng	I stayed calm and focused.
5741259	eng	I saw their wedding photo.
5741267	eng	Tom was given thirty years.
5741270	eng	Tom was educated in Boston.
5741274	eng	I need to admit something.
5741277	eng	I might go into marketing.
5741279	eng	Tom was charged with arson.
5741281	eng	I like your writing style.
5741282	eng	Tom was assigned to Boston.
5741290	eng	I know that sounds idiotic.
5741291	eng	Tom was an expert horseman.
5741295	eng	I knew we'd come back.
5741296	eng	I knew something was awry.
5741301	eng	I hope they remember this.
5741305	eng	I heard the water running.
5741306	eng	Tom was a wonderful fellow.
5741310	eng	I have three little girls.
5741311	eng	I have some health issues.
5741313	eng	I have no personal agenda.
5741314	eng	I have no obligation here.
5741323	eng	I found it very difficult.
5741327	eng	Tom walked toward the door.
5741330	eng	Tom voted for the proposal.
5741335	eng	I don't use crack cocaine.
5741336	eng	Tom turned pale with anger.
5741340	eng	I didn't choose this life.
5741345	eng	Tom tried to manipulate me.
5741347	eng	I decided to take control.
5741349	eng	I couldn't get through it.
5741350	eng	I couldn't call my family.
5741353	eng	I could tell them nothing.
5741357	eng	Tom took advantage of this.
5741358	eng	I certainly would hope so.
5741359	eng	I can't take it seriously.
5741367	eng	I can give you assurances.
5741368	eng	I can finally get married.
5741369	eng	Tom thinks outside the box.
5741517	eng	Why are we stopping here?
5741675	eng	I agreed with the verdict.
5741678	eng	How were the teams chosen?
5741680	eng	How valid are the results?
5741682	eng	Tom studies hard every day.
5741683	eng	How much are the payments?
5741684	eng	How is that any different?
5741686	eng	How happy is happy enough?
5741688	eng	Tom struck out three times.
5741689	eng	How do you not understand?
5741690	eng	How do you define success?
5741691	eng	Tom stood behind a counter.
5741692	eng	How do people afford that?
5741696	eng	How can they condone this?
5741697	eng	Tom stayed on the sideline.
5741699	eng	Here's what you should do.
5741700	eng	Tom spoke in broken French.
5741701	eng	Here's how the game works.
5742040	eng	Tom spoke directly to Mary.
5742041	eng	Here is a perfect example.
5742042	eng	Here is a general outline.
5742044	eng	Here are the exact quotes.
5742049	eng	Tom should have no regrets.
5742053	eng	Get away from the railing.
5742059	eng	Everyone was on their own.
5742060	eng	Everyone wants to beat us.
5742065	eng	Everybody likes you a lot.
5742463	eng	Do we truly love Sabah?
5742466	eng	I go anywhere I like.
5742519	eng	Don't let them bother you.
5742520	eng	Don't let down your guard.
5742521	eng	Tom seemed oblivious to it.
5742522	eng	Don't be deceived by that.
5742523	eng	Don't be caught off guard.
5742524	eng	Tom seemed in good spirits.
5742529	eng	Do you accept the premise?
5742530	eng	Tom scored the winning run.
5742532	eng	Did you order the bombing?
5742534	eng	Did you just look outside?
5742536	eng	Tom said there are options.
5742538	eng	Dancing is just plain fun.
5742540	eng	Could you hold it, please?
5742541	eng	Cost hasn't been an issue.
5742542	eng	Tom retired after 30 years.
5742545	eng	Tom refuses to accept that.
5742771	eng	Tom read the letter slowly.
5742776	eng	Can you even speak French?
5742778	eng	Can the country afford it?
5742779	eng	Call it anything you want.
5742782	eng	Bring home all the troops.
5742788	eng	Beer is an acquired taste.
5742789	eng	Tom played real well today.
5742790	eng	Be very careful out there.
5742791	eng	Be prepared to seek cover.
5742794	eng	Are you feeling the pinch?
5742795	eng	Tom objected to the change.
5742796	eng	Thank you for your indulgence.
5742800	eng	Are they not victims, too?
5742803	eng	Are all those people poor?
5742804	eng	Anyone can ask a question.
5742808	eng	Tom needs to stay involved.
5742809	eng	Any little bit would help.
5742811	eng	Tom needs to remember that.
5742812	eng	Always smile and be happy.
5742817	eng	Tom need not have bothered.
5742820	eng	Tom moved towards the door.
5742822	eng	A little nudge might help.
5742823	eng	Tom made me feel unwelcome.
5742826	eng	Tom made an illegal U-turn.
5742876	eng	They boarded the wrong plane.
5743288	eng	This frog has webbed feet.
5743492	eng	You're in charge of this.
5743493	eng	Tom made a painful mistake.
5743494	eng	You really are the worst.
5743495	eng	You need to respect that.
5743496	eng	Tom made a huge difference.
5743497	eng	You misread what I wrote.
5743498	eng	You may disagree with me.
5743499	eng	Tom made Mary feel special.
5743500	eng	You know where I'm going.
5743504	eng	You don't have to settle.
5743506	eng	You don't have to choose.
5743507	eng	Will you please stop now?
5743508	eng	Tom looks nice and healthy.
5743514	eng	Tom looked at Mary angrily.
5743515	eng	Why shouldn't I kill you?
5743516	eng	Why not make it official?
5743518	eng	Why is the train delayed?
5743519	eng	Why haven't I been fired?
5743520	eng	Tom lived a sheltered life.
5743860	eng	I have given it back.
5743871	eng	He hurt me on purpose.
5743872	eng	She hurt me on purpose.
5743905	eng	For more information, contact us.
5744117	eng	Why did you stop writing?
5744120	eng	Why are they worried now?
5744123	eng	Who's going to beat them?
5744125	eng	Tom knows nothing about us.
5744126	eng	Who wants money from you?
5744127	eng	Who doesn't want to work?
5744130	eng	Who called me last night?
5744131	eng	Tom knew something was off.
5744134	eng	Tom knew Mary was pregnant.
5744135	eng	Where else could they be?
5744136	eng	Where does this leave me?
5744140	eng	Tom just couldn't go there.
5744142	eng	When will you forgive me?
5744144	eng	What you suspect is true.
5744145	eng	What you need is clarity.
5744152	eng	What would keep us apart?
5744153	eng	What were the best parts?
5744155	eng	What was your first clue?
5744156	eng	What should we call this?
5744160	eng	Tom isn't even a contender.
5744161	eng	What haven't I asked you?
5744162	eng	What happens if it rains?
5744164	eng	What good are you people?
5744166	eng	Tom isn't a client anymore.
5744167	eng	What do you guys believe?
5744170	eng	What did your doctor say?
5744173	eng	What did they talk about?
5744174	eng	What damage did you find?
5744176	eng	What chance do they have?
5744177	eng	What brings you two here?
5744178	eng	Tom is the perfect example.
5744180	eng	What are your hours like?
5744182	eng	What are you involved in?
5744183	eng	What are we dealing with?
5744184	eng	Tom is such an inspiration.
5744185	eng	What are they wanted for?
5744190	eng	Tom is shy, but aggressive.
5744195	eng	We've waited a long time.
5744197	eng	We've moved on from that.
5744200	eng	We've got it all covered.
5744210	eng	We're not making this up.
5744212	eng	We're not going that far.
5744213	eng	We're not even that poor.
5744217	eng	Tom is married, Mary isn't.
5744223	eng	We're all still in shock.
5744224	eng	We'll take a quick break.
5744225	eng	Tom is less than impressed.
5744226	eng	We'll see what they want.
5744227	eng	We'll see how it unfolds.
5744228	eng	Tom is just obeying orders.
5744229	eng	We'll continue to use it.
5744230	eng	We'll be looking for you.
5744234	eng	Tom is feeling really good.
5744236	eng	We were just playing tag.
5744239	eng	We want to reassure them.
5744240	eng	Tom is an unbelievable kid.
5744243	eng	Tom is an outstanding poet.
5744246	eng	Tom is an exemplary father.
5744248	eng	We took care of business.
5744249	eng	Tom is an excellent choice.
5744252	eng	Tom is an excellent author.
5744253	eng	We take dirt for granted.
5744254	eng	We stayed in close touch.
5744255	eng	Tom is already really good.
5744258	eng	Tom is actually doing that.
5744261	eng	Tom is a wonderful speaker.
5744265	eng	We never dreamed of that.
5744268	eng	We need to ask questions.
5744270	eng	Tom is a mild-mannered man.
5744272	eng	We must love one another.
5744273	eng	Tom is a methodical person.
5744281	eng	We know right from wrong.
5744284	eng	We kept looking for help.
5744286	eng	We kept hanging in there.
5744288	eng	Tom hasn't had any regrets.
5744292	eng	We haven't seen that yet.
5744294	eng	Tom has taught me patience.
5744295	eng	We have great cooks here.
5744302	eng	We don't need to splurge.
5744309	eng	Tom has never been injured.
5744310	eng	We didn't play very well.
5744311	eng	We didn't have an answer.
5744313	eng	We could always use more.
5744314	eng	We choose to take action.
5744315	eng	Tom has made some progress.
5744317	eng	We can't beat the system.
5744318	eng	Tom has made an about-face.
5744322	eng	We can clearly do better.
5744323	eng	We believe in each other.
5744328	eng	War soon broke out again.
5744330	eng	Tom has broken many hearts.
5744333	eng	Tom has been elected mayor.
5744334	eng	Those who can't do, teach.
5744335	eng	Those days are long gone.
5744336	eng	Tom has been courting Mary.
5744338	eng	This will help you relax.
5744340	eng	This wasn't an easy deal.
5744342	eng	Tom has always been strong.
5744344	eng	This makes me feel dirty.
5744345	eng	Tom has a strong character.
5744346	eng	This isn't on the agenda.
5744354	eng	Tom had to be hospitalized.
5744355	eng	This is the same concept.
5744356	eng	This is the real problem.
5744363	eng	Tom had no further details.
5744364	eng	This is my favorite beer.
5744368	eng	This is all about change.
5744369	eng	Tom had a similar reaction.
5744370	eng	This has been a blessing.
5744371	eng	This comes as a surprise.
5744375	eng	Tom grew even more worried.
5744376	eng	This can't go on forever.
5744378	eng	Tom graduated a year early.
5744384	eng	They're to blame as well.
5744385	eng	Tom got married very young.
5744386	eng	They're the team to beat.
5744390	eng	They're on the same side.
5744395	eng	They're not hard to find.
5744398	eng	They're going to trap us.
5744399	eng	They're going to make it.
5744401	eng	They're going to love me.
5744402	eng	They're going to like me.
5744403	eng	Tom gave Mary an ultimatum.
5744404	eng	They're going to kill us.
5744405	eng	They're going to hear us.
5744406	eng	Tom gave Mary an allowance.
5744407	eng	They're going to find us.
5744408	eng	They're going to be here.
5744412	eng	Tom figures he's not alone.
5744413	eng	They're eager to see you.
5744414	eng	They're coming to get us.
5744419	eng	They're all going to die.
5744420	eng	They'll be tough to beat.
5744427	eng	Tom extended his right arm.
5744429	eng	They took us by surprise.
5744432	eng	They stuck to their plan.
5744433	eng	Tom escaped into the woods.
5744434	eng	They stuck to their guns.
5744444	eng	They have a clear choice.
5744446	eng	They didn't go back home.
5744447	eng	They didn't do their job.
5744449	eng	They both liked the plan.
5744451	eng	Tom died a miserable death.
5744456	eng	There's no life on Pluto.
5744458	eng	There's no cure in sight.
5744461	eng	There's a cop behind you.
5744462	eng	There's a bus stop there.
5744464	eng	There won't be much more.
5744466	eng	Tom didn't see anyone else.
5744467	eng	There was only one catch.
5744470	eng	There is reason for hope.
5744471	eng	There is no happy ending.
5744475	eng	Tom didn't like being poor.
5744482	eng	The winner gets a trophy.
5744483	eng	The wine bottle is empty.
5744484	eng	Tom deserves to be spoiled.
5744491	eng	The ship is under attack.
5744492	eng	The safest answer is yes.
5744497	eng	The public didn't buy it.
5744500	eng	The police are out there.
5744502	eng	Tom decided to close early.
5744503	eng	The party is wrapping up.
5744505	eng	Tom decided not to testify.
5744507	eng	The lesson here is clear.
5744508	eng	Tom cut across Mary's yard.
5744509	eng	The law will handle this.
5744511	eng	Tom couldn't talk about it.
5744513	eng	The door was frozen shut.
5744514	eng	Tom couldn't open his hand.
5744515	eng	The crowd is breaking up.
5744517	eng	Tom could've used the help.
5744522	eng	The coffee is weak today.
5744526	eng	Tom came into the building.
5744531	eng	The board took no action.
5744532	eng	Tom came across the street.
5744534	eng	The answer was always no.
5744536	eng	The answer is mostly yes.
5744542	eng	That's what my wife wore.
5744546	eng	That's not even an issue.
5744547	eng	Tom badly needed the money.
5744548	eng	That's not a real secret.
5744549	eng	That's my kind of action.
5744550	eng	Tom backed up Mary's story.
5744552	eng	That's just what we want.
5744554	eng	That's just not the case.
5744555	eng	That's just not my thing.
5744557	eng	That's how I feel anyway.
5744561	eng	That's a very good story.
5744563	eng	That's a priority for us.
5744564	eng	That's a pretty big hole.
5744565	eng	Tom and Mary switched cars.
5744566	eng	That would come in handy.
5744567	eng	That was the worst thing.
5744568	eng	Tom and Mary married young.
5744569	eng	That was the whole point.
5744570	eng	That was surely the plan.
5744572	eng	That was nice, wasn't it.
5744573	eng	That was important to us.
5744575	eng	That was bound to happen.
5744576	eng	That was an amazing play.
5744579	eng	That seemed to be enough.
5744582	eng	That means we can change.
5744583	eng	Tom and I have differences.
5744584	eng	That dream has come true.
5744592	eng	Tom almost lost his family.
5744595	eng	Tom admits he wasn't happy.
5744597	eng	Someone will have to pay.
5744598	eng	Tom actually tried to talk.
5744599	eng	Some people don't get it.
5744600	eng	Some chips would be nice.
5744602	eng	So what's your deal here?
5744603	eng	So what's this all about?
5744605	eng	So what were the results?
5744606	eng	So what was the solution?
5744608	eng	So what is your solution?
5744681	eng	Show me your scars again.
5744682	eng	Should you have a prenup?
5744685	eng	Share your story with us.
5744688	eng	Shall we call the police?
5744692	eng	Things didn't go Tom's way.
5744696	eng	Remember how hard it was.
5744705	eng	Please let us watch this.
5744706	eng	Perhaps now is your time.
5744708	eng	People want to live here.
5744709	eng	People said I was pretty.
5744711	eng	People are working on it.
5744713	eng	Please connect me with Tom.
5744720	eng	Our journey will be long.
5744721	eng	Our friends are in there.
5744723	eng	Our family is very happy.
5744724	eng	One accident is too many.
5744727	eng	Now they've gone too far.
5744729	eng	Now the hard work begins.
5744730	eng	Now my friends are upset.
5744736	eng	Nobody wants to admit it.
5744738	eng	Nobody gets used to that.
5744740	eng	I'm going with Tom tonight.
5744746	eng	I was just challenging Tom.
5744747	eng	My patience just ran out.
5744754	eng	My family had many debts.
5744762	eng	Most of us were veterans.
5744764	eng	I read Tom's message first.
5744765	eng	Maybe you should grow up.
5744768	eng	Maybe we should split up.
5744769	eng	Maybe we can circle back.
5744771	eng	Many things are the same.
5744774	eng	Life is full of unknowns.
5744775	eng	Let's wrap this thing up.
5744777	eng	Let's tear down the jail.
5744778	eng	Let's take a deep breath.
5744780	eng	Let's start with the why.
5744781	eng	Let's start from the top.
5744784	eng	Let's not be stupid here.
5744785	eng	I believe Tom is electable.
5744790	eng	Let me make a prediction.
5744791	eng	Here's where Tom was wrong.
5744795	eng	Leave your radio at home.
5744796	eng	Leave the rest for later.
5744798	eng	Leave the poor kid alone.
5744799	eng	Last night was a mistake.
5744801	eng	Kids don't have a choice.
5744802	eng	Keep your wits about you.
5744805	eng	Keep these facts in mind.
5744807	eng	Just humor me, all right?
5744808	eng	Jazz is not my specialty.
5744810	eng	It's what I always drink.
5744811	eng	It's time we fought back.
5744817	eng	It's really hard to stop.
5744818	eng	We've never talked to Tom.
5744819	eng	It's out of your control.
5744826	eng	It's not always my fault.
5744828	eng	It's not a simple answer.
5744829	eng	It's never going to last.
5744832	eng	It's just what you think.
5744833	eng	We always wanted Tom back.
5744834	eng	It's happening to me now.
5744835	eng	It's going to get uglier.
5744837	eng	It's going to get better.
5744838	eng	It's going to be awesome.
5744839	eng	Tom's throat had been cut.
5744840	eng	It's difficult to sum up.
5744845	eng	Tom's last day was Monday.
5744846	eng	It's been a tough winter.
5744847	eng	It's been a strange year.
5744849	eng	It's been a long process.
5744850	eng	It's been a long journey.
5744852	eng	It's been a huge success.
5744853	eng	It's been a hard journey.
5744854	eng	Tom has got some experience.
5744855	eng	It's been a great summer.
5744856	eng	It's all a great mystery.
5744860	eng	Tom's best friend is Mary.
5744862	eng	It would be an adventure.
5744864	eng	It wasn't in our control.
5744866	eng	Tom won't turn up tonight.
5744870	eng	It was the worst feeling.
5744871	eng	It was the doctor's call.
5744879	eng	It was an acquired taste.
5744880	eng	It was always very clear.
5744881	eng	Tom will continue to wait.
5744882	eng	It was a family decision.
5744883	eng	It was a family business.
5744885	eng	It was a different world.
5744890	eng	Tom will be in attendance.
5744894	eng	It nearly broke my heart.
5744895	eng	It makes you look guilty.
5744896	eng	Tom wasn't there for Mary.
5744897	eng	It helps to be connected.
5744898	eng	It hasn't happened a lot.
5744900	eng	It happened the next day.
5744903	eng	It could get really ugly.
5744904	eng	It cost them their lives.
5744907	eng	It changed in an instant.
5744909	eng	It can really affect you.
5744910	eng	Is there a return policy?
5744911	eng	Tom was still seeing Mary.
5744912	eng	Is there a middle ground?
5744914	eng	Tom was still behind bars.
5744915	eng	Is that what it's called?
5744916	eng	Is that the correct path?
5744917	eng	Tom was stabbed in Boston.
5744919	eng	Is that appealing to you?
5744920	eng	Tom was smitten with Mary.
5744922	eng	Is cost the major factor?
5744928	eng	I've lost my best friend.
5744929	eng	Tom was screaming at Mary.
5744930	eng	I've lost a great friend.
5744931	eng	I've fought a good fight.
5744933	eng	I've come to accept this.
5744938	eng	Tom was pretty much drunk.
5744939	eng	I'm tired of high school.
5744943	eng	I'm sorry for the mishap.
5744945	eng	I'm running out of steam.
5744951	eng	I'm not going home happy.
5744953	eng	Tom was given a polygraph.
5744960	eng	I'm in a unique position.
5744961	eng	I'm here for three years.
5744965	eng	Tom was elected on Monday.
5744966	eng	I'm glad it's sorted out.
5744968	eng	Tom was caught red handed.
5744969	eng	I'm fighting for my life.
5744972	eng	I'm clearly out of touch.
5744974	eng	Tom was bullied at school.
5744976	eng	I'm a very visual person.
5744977	eng	Tom was assigned the task.
5745039	eng	Tom was an absolute angel.
5745043	eng	I'll answer that for you.
5745044	eng	I wrenched open the door.
5745047	eng	I worked with those guys.
5745048	eng	Tom wanted to poison Mary.
5745049	eng	I won't turn anyone away.
5745050	eng	I won't open this letter.
5745051	eng	Tom walked away from Mary.
5745053	eng	I went there three times.
5745054	eng	Tom vaulted over the wall.
5745056	eng	I was the outsider today.
5745058	eng	I was speaking the truth.
5745060	eng	Tom turned into a fanatic.
5745063	eng	Tom tried to learn French.
5745064	eng	I was like everyone else.
5745066	eng	Tom tried to avoid arrest.
5745069	eng	Tom tried a new technique.
5745073	eng	I want to eat tortellini.
5745076	eng	I want to be competitive.
5745088	eng	I think that was extreme.
5745089	eng	I think it's very doable.
5745096	eng	Tom sued them for damages.
5745098	eng	I take it very seriously.
5745101	eng	I still needed some help.
5745105	eng	Tom stared into Mary eyes.
5745109	eng	I sat there in disbelief.
5745113	eng	I practice what I preach.
5745114	eng	Tom spoke about the issue.
5745115	eng	I play better on defense.
5745117	eng	Tom slowly raised his gun.
5745120	eng	Tom simply doesn't buy it.
5745122	eng	I know we'll bounce back.
5745123	eng	Tom shouldn't be far away.
5745124	eng	I know that I've changed.
5745125	eng	I know help is available.
5745126	eng	Tom should really do that.
5745129	eng	Tom shot Mary point blank.
5745133	eng	I kind of went overboard.
5745139	eng	I just followed my heart.
5745144	eng	Tom says he used steroids.
5745145	eng	I heard three loud bangs.
5745146	eng	I heard the kids running.
5745151	eng	I have a savings account.
5745152	eng	I have a mischievous cat.
5745164	eng	I got a little emotional.
5745165	eng	Tom really made it happen.
5745169	eng	I felt pretty ripped off.
5745171	eng	Tom proved them all wrong.
5745172	eng	I feel positive about it.
5745174	eng	Tom prefers tea to coffee.
5745176	eng	I don't need any support.
5745179	eng	I don't know your habits.
5745181	eng	I don't feel like myself.
5745185	eng	I don't believe I helped.
5745189	eng	Tom never took a vacation.
5745190	eng	I didn't plant that bomb.
5745191	eng	I did read the interview.
5745192	eng	Tom never tells the truth.
5745194	eng	I definitely need a plan.
5745195	eng	Tom never saw this coming.
5745196	eng	I decided to push myself.
5745198	eng	Tom never saw that coming.
5745200	eng	I couldn't put it better.
5745204	eng	Tom needs to be motivated.
5745205	eng	I can't honestly say why.
5745212	eng	I believe it was suicide.
5745213	eng	Tom needs a diaper change.
5745214	eng	I almost broke the chair.
5745215	eng	I absolutely love my job.
5745216	eng	Tom need not have worried.
5745217	eng	How much should you save?
5745219	eng	Tom might be really wrong.
5745220	eng	How many lives were lost?
5745226	eng	How did they manage this?
5745229	eng	How can you explain that?
5745230	eng	How can we avoid trouble?
5745232	eng	How can I reconcile this?
5745234	eng	Tom lives above his means.
5745235	eng	Hey, at least I'm honest.
5745236	eng	Help is already en route.
5745238	eng	Have another drink on me.
5745239	eng	Have I steered you wrong?
5745244	eng	French is hard, isn't it?
5745246	eng	Tom likes games of chance.
5745249	eng	Tom lied to the policeman.
5745253	eng	Everyone I know is angry.
5745257	eng	Don't stay home and mope.
5745258	eng	Tom knows how to campaign.
5745259	eng	Don't play the race card.
5745260	eng	Don't be such a sourpuss.
5745262	eng	Don't be afraid to dance.
5745265	eng	Does it affect your work?
5745268	eng	Do you want my autograph?
5745269	eng	Do you remember the code?
5745271	eng	Do you need toilet paper?
5745272	eng	Do you need medical help?
5745273	eng	Tom just might get better.
5745274	eng	Do you have five dollars?
5745275	eng	Do you have any suspects?
5745278	eng	Do you find that strange?
5745280	eng	Do you expect a backlash?
5745282	eng	Tom isn't dumber than you.
5745283	eng	Do we want to contribute?
5745284	eng	Do we know anything more?
5745285	eng	Tom isn't a normal person.
5745289	eng	Do good wherever you can.
5745291	eng	Tom is the obvious choice.
5745292	eng	Did you steal that dress?
5745293	eng	Did you just hear voices?
5745297	eng	Tom is sweet and innocent.
5745298	eng	Did you hate your mother?
5745300	eng	Tom is suspected of arson.
5745302	eng	Did you fall back asleep?
5745303	eng	Tom is stronger than John.
5745304	eng	Did you change your hair?
5745305	eng	Did the deal go smoothly?
5745307	eng	Did I hear you correctly?
5745310	eng	Could we raise the money?
5745311	eng	Could I get another shot?
5745312	eng	Tom is rich but miserable.
5745316	eng	Come off your high horse.
5745317	eng	Come by my place tonight.
5745319	eng	Cold cases do get solved.
5745320	eng	Clear cutting is so ugly.
5745323	eng	Can you buy weapons here?
5745324	eng	Tom is now awaiting trial.
5745325	eng	Can I have a replacement?
5745328	eng	Blondes do have more fun.
5745333	eng	Tom is loved by everybody.
5745334	eng	Bath salts would be nice.
5745335	eng	Bad people do bad things.
5745336	eng	Tom is lacking in courage.
5745337	eng	Are you willing to learn?
5745338	eng	Are you stark raving mad?
5745341	eng	Are you leaving so early?
5745342	eng	Tom is hopelessly in love.
5745343	eng	Are you just saying that?
5745344	eng	Are you here for tickets?
5745346	eng	Are you finished with me?
5745352	eng	Are we allowed back here?
5745353	eng	Are they messing with us?
5745354	eng	Tom is an outstanding kid.
5745355	eng	Are they coming this way?
5745356	eng	Anyone here can beat you.
5745357	eng	Tom is actually a drummer.
5745358	eng	Anyone can get head lice.
5745359	eng	A tight race is expected.
5745360	eng	Tom is a wonderful friend.
5745362	eng	A change could be coming.
5745365	eng	Your tailor is a genius.
5745366	eng	Tom is a strong candidate.
5745378	eng	Tom is a good-hearted man.
5745381	eng	Tom is a brilliant artist.
5745384	eng	Tom is Mary's new husband.
5745386	eng	You'd do the same thing.
5745388	eng	You won't do any better.
5745389	eng	You shouldn't let it go.
5745392	eng	Tom heard a train whistle.
5745394	eng	You have to accept that.
5745397	eng	You got lucky this time.
5745399	eng	You can take the credit.
5745400	eng	You can afford to relax.
5745401	eng	Tom has tons of potential.
5745402	eng	You called me a traitor.
5745403	eng	Yeah, I figured as much.
5745405	eng	Would you prefer I lied?
5745406	eng	Why would God choose me?
5745407	eng	Tom has rejected the idea.
5745408	eng	Why the change of heart?
5745409	eng	Why not join me tonight?
5745410	eng	Tom has refused the offer.
5745411	eng	Why not change the size?
5745413	eng	Tom has much higher hopes.
5745415	eng	Why is God punishing me?
5745481	eng	Where are your silk gowns?
5745563	eng	Milk is better than water.
5745596	eng	Can you talk more slowly?
5745688	eng	Better sure than a loser.
5745701	eng	Glory lasts longer than life.
5745704	eng	Shame lasts longer than anything.
5745849	eng	Why do we play football?
5745855	eng	Why can't they see that?
5745856	eng	Tom has denied the claims.
5745858	eng	Why are we so different?
5745860	eng	Who's this I see coming?
5745864	eng	Who would be doing that?
5745867	eng	Who can say for certain?
5745869	eng	Who are you calling fat?
5745870	eng	Which do you value more?
5745871	eng	Tom has a pale complexion.
5745872	eng	Where shall we go today?
5745873	eng	Where does our money go?
5745876	eng	What's your plan for me?
5745877	eng	Tom has a beautiful house.
5745878	eng	What's on tap for today?
5745879	eng	What's it going to take?
5745880	eng	Tom had the locks changed.
5745881	eng	What was your big break?
5745882	eng	What was that last part?
5745883	eng	Tom had so much potential.
5745884	eng	What tribe are you from?
5745885	eng	What should we wait for?
5745886	eng	Tom had so many interests.
5745887	eng	What other way is there?
5745888	eng	What meeting did I miss?
5745891	eng	What did you boys catch?
5745893	eng	What did that feel like?
5745894	eng	What could be out there?
5745895	eng	Tom had a hasty breakfast.
5745897	eng	What are we drinking to?
5745898	eng	Tom grew up with dyslexia.
5745901	eng	Tom grew up around racing.
5745902	eng	What I need is leverage.
5745904	eng	Tom gives a great haircut.
5745911	eng	We're unsure what to do.
5745912	eng	We're not here to judge.
5745916	eng	Tom gave Mary a fist-bump.
5745919	eng	Tom found the door closed.
5745922	eng	Tom fell into bad company.
5745924	eng	We're close to a crisis.
5745930	eng	We're a phone call away.
5745932	eng	We're a nation of sheep.
5745933	eng	We're a nation of fools.
5745934	eng	Tom disagreed at the time.
5745935	eng	We'll get you the money.
5745936	eng	We'd love to acquire it.
5745937	eng	Tom died of typhoid fever.
5745942	eng	We were going real fast.
5745943	eng	Tom didn't make any noise.
5745945	eng	We went out elk hunting.
5745946	eng	Tom didn't have an answer.
5745948	eng	We saw you driving away.
5745952	eng	Tom didn't even slow down.
5745965	eng	We knew this was coming.
5745967	eng	Tom cracked a small smile.
5745970	eng	Tom couldn't live with it.
5745972	eng	We have fun here, right?
5745975	eng	We had a delightful day.
5745977	eng	We got lucky last night.
5745978	eng	We fought a good battle.
5745981	eng	We don't need more debt.
5745982	eng	Tom came along soon after.
5745983	eng	We don't deal with that.
5745984	eng	We didn't play our best.
5745985	eng	Tom came along much later.
5745991	eng	Tom called Mary from jail.
5745992	eng	Was this a game changer?
5745993	eng	Was that the right call?
5745994	eng	Tom brought it on himself.
5745995	eng	Wait until you get home.
5745996	eng	Wait until you get here.
5745997	eng	Tom bought a plane ticket.
5745998	eng	Wait until you get back.
5745999	eng	Wait till you get there.
5746002	eng	Try to prove them wrong.
5746003	eng	Tom began to learn French.
5746004	eng	Trust me, you need this.
5746005	eng	Trust me, it's worth it.
5746006	eng	Tom became a great artist.
5746009	eng	Tom asked to be corrected.
5746011	eng	Those days are now over.
5746017	eng	This was hardly a shock.
5746020	eng	This trip was a success.
5746021	eng	Tom and I are like-minded.
5746035	eng	This is much more risky.
5746036	eng	This is what Tom deserves.
5746037	eng	This is like the movies.
5746041	eng	This is hard to justify.
5746047	eng	This is a training camp.
5746050	eng	This is a bit offensive.
5746052	eng	This is a bad precedent.
5746053	eng	This could be your year.
5746054	eng	Let's wait around for Tom.
5746055	eng	This came as a surprise.
5746059	eng	This is a developing story.
5746064	eng	They've come a long way.
5746066	eng	Is Tom nervous about that?
5746083	eng	They want to get better.
5746088	eng	They kind of adopted me.
5746091	eng	They don't need one yet.
5746092	eng	They don't listen to us.
5746093	eng	I'm best friends with Tom.
5746094	eng	There's no sign of them.
5746095	eng	There's a reason for it.
5746097	eng	There's a lot of demand.
5746101	eng	There was so much blood.
5746103	eng	There was no going back.
5746105	eng	I went into Tom's bedroom.
5746107	eng	There was a traffic jam.
5746119	eng	The world has gone nuts.
5746121	eng	The word is getting out.
5746127	eng	The school year is over.
5746130	eng	The river level is high.
5746132	eng	I dealt directly with Tom.
5746135	eng	I couldn't figure Tom out.
5746138	eng	I couldn't beat Tom today.
5746139	eng	The kid was pretty good.
5746143	eng	The fire never went out.
5746144	eng	I agree entirely with Tom.
5746145	eng	The fire alarm went off.
5746146	eng	The facts are the facts.
5746147	eng	Even Tom admitted to this.
5746148	eng	The distance is too far.
5746151	eng	The demand is very real.
5746152	eng	The death rate was high.
5746153	eng	Call Tom for more details.
5746157	eng	The concept is the same.
5746159	eng	Allow me to introduce Tom.
5746162	eng	You drove Tom to suicide.
5746164	eng	The big day has arrived.
5746166	eng	The answer should be no.
5746167	eng	That's why we oppose it.
5746169	eng	That's where we are now.
5746172	eng	That's not saying a lot.
5746173	eng	That's not at all clear.
5746175	eng	That's not a hate crime.
5746176	eng	That would only be fair.
5746177	eng	We stand behind you, Tom.
5746178	eng	That was a terrible day.
5746179	eng	That was a good meeting.
5746184	eng	That seemed like a joke.
5746185	eng	That scares us to death.
5746187	eng	That really says it all.
5746188	eng	That may not apply here.
5746189	eng	We felt sympathy for Tom.
5746190	eng	That may need to change.
5746194	eng	That could be the issue.
5746202	eng	Thank you for your call.
5746203	eng	Thank you for having us.
5746204	eng	Tom's mother was a nurse.
5746209	eng	So what's our next move?
5746216	eng	Tom's hard work paid off.
5746218	eng	Please get out and vote.
5746221	eng	Please allow me to work.
5746225	eng	Tom's got a great future.
5746226	eng	People have to be ready.
5746228	eng	Tom's eye color is green.
5746231	eng	Tom wrote to his parents.
5746239	eng	Nothing was given to me.
5746240	eng	Tom would never harm you.
5746244	eng	Nobody knows what we do.
5746246	eng	Tom won't play this year.
5746247	eng	No one will do anything.
5746248	eng	No one twisted your arm.
5746255	eng	Tom will succeed in time.
5746257	eng	My prayers are with you.
5746261	eng	Tom will be truly missed.
5746263	eng	My left arm is tingling.
5746264	eng	Tom will be sadly missed.
5746266	eng	My husband is a veteran.
5746267	eng	Tom will be proven right.
5746268	eng	My house is in disarray.
5746269	eng	My heart began to pound.
5746270	eng	Tom will be off tomorrow.
5746274	eng	My dad built that house.
5746275	eng	My business is with you.
5746276	eng	Tom went along with Mary.
5746279	eng	Tom wasn't on the flight.
5746282	eng	Tom wasn't helpful to me.
5746286	eng	Life is great right now.
5746287	eng	Let's take a sneak peek.
5746288	eng	Tom wasn't asking for it.
5746291	eng	Tom was whistling a tune.
5746292	eng	Let me get my checkbook.
5746293	eng	Last night was the best.
5746294	eng	Tom was wearing a helmet.
5746296	eng	Just how bad are things?
5746299	eng	It's what you asked for.
5746300	eng	Tom was the right choice.
5746301	eng	It's what we always say.
5746302	eng	It's tough to get there.
5746308	eng	It's part of growing up.
5746312	eng	Tom was really into that.
5746314	eng	It's not really a shock.
5746316	eng	It's not likely to work.
5746317	eng	It's not just a concept.
5746327	eng	Tom was pardoned in 2013.
5746328	eng	It's hard to keep track.
5746329	eng	It's going to take days.
5746330	eng	Tom was out with friends.
5746333	eng	Tom was never seen again.
5746334	eng	It's best you leave now.
5746335	eng	It's been kind of crazy.
5746337	eng	It's been a nice change.
5746339	eng	Tom was mentored by Mary.
5746344	eng	It'll never be the same.
5746346	eng	It would be so exciting.
5746347	eng	It won't work like that.
5746350	eng	It won't be any problem.
5746352	eng	It wasn't easy to sleep.
5746354	eng	Tom was clubbed to death.
5746355	eng	It wasn't a prison camp.
5746550	eng	Tom wants his food bland.
5746552	eng	It was driving me crazy.
5746553	eng	Tom wanted to leave Mary.
5746554	eng	It was brutal out there.
5746555	eng	It was before your time.
5746556	eng	Tom wanted his land back.
5746557	eng	It was an uphill battle.
5746559	eng	Tom walked into the bank.
5746564	eng	It was a difficult time.
5746566	eng	It was a different time.
5746567	eng	It was a big difference.
5746569	eng	It took you long enough.
5746572	eng	It seemed a perfect fit.
5746573	eng	It really was like that.
5746574	eng	Tom tried to murder Mary.
5746576	eng	It really cheered me up.
5746579	eng	It makes my life easier.
5746580	eng	Tom trembled like a leaf.
5746581	eng	It just didn't work out.
5746582	eng	It just boggles my mind.
5746583	eng	Tom took what wasn't his.
5746585	eng	It got worse from there.
5746586	eng	Tom took the first prize.
5746590	eng	It can never get better.
5746593	eng	Isn't that how it works?
5746594	eng	Is this your first time?
5746598	eng	Tom thought he was dying.
5746600	eng	Is there a pattern here?
5746603	eng	Is that a capital crime?
5746605	eng	Is it really that close?
5746606	eng	Is it different for you?
5746608	eng	Is it business as usual?
5746612	eng	I've lost sleep over it.
5746613	eng	Tom stuck to his promise.
5746614	eng	I've learned to do that.
5746620	eng	I've cut back this year.
5746621	eng	I'm the only one around.
5746622	eng	Tom stays out of trouble.
5746624	eng	I'm sorry we can't come.
5746626	eng	I'm quite happy with it.
5746627	eng	I'm proud of this award.
5746628	eng	Tom staged his own death.
5746629	eng	I'm not the victim here.
5746630	eng	I'm not an arrogant guy.
5746634	eng	Tom sneaked up behind me.
5746635	eng	I'm having too much fun.
5746637	eng	I'm going to stop there.
5746638	eng	Tom shot and killed Mary.
5746639	eng	I'm going to keep going.
5746640	eng	I'm going the next time.
5746641	eng	Tom says he doesn't swim.
5746644	eng	Tom said he would appeal.
5746647	eng	Tom said all wasn't lost.
5746648	eng	I'm always on your side.
5746651	eng	I'm a real good tracker.
5746653	eng	Tom rose early as always.
5746657	eng	I'll get some work done.
5746659	eng	Tom refuses to slow down.
5746661	eng	I'd sooner be in Boston.
5746662	eng	Tom readily agreed to it.
5746663	eng	I'd rather go to prison.
5746664	eng	I'd never marry you now.
5746665	eng	Tom ran out into traffic.
5746668	eng	Tom ran into another car.
5746673	eng	I won't be voting today.
5746676	eng	I was very well coached.
5746677	eng	Tom prefers fish to meat.
5746680	eng	Tom prefers dogs to cats.
5746682	eng	I was starting to panic.
5746683	eng	Tom prefers beer to wine.
5746686	eng	Tom poured his heart out.
5746689	eng	Tom plays his cards well.
5746691	eng	I warned you in advance.
5746692	eng	Tom played a great match.
5746700	eng	I want to become better.
5746701	eng	Tom ordered an ice cream.
5746707	eng	Tom never loses his head.
5746708	eng	I thought that was fine.
5746709	eng	I think you're off base.
5746710	eng	Tom never looked at Mary.
5746711	eng	I think we've been good.
5746712	eng	I think we're past that.
5746714	eng	I think it's very wrong.
5746715	eng	I think it's about time.
5746717	eng	I think it looks classy.
5746722	eng	Tom needed a fresh start.
5746723	eng	I started at the bottom.
5746726	eng	I smell a hidden agenda.
5746731	eng	Tom manages a shoe store.
5746732	eng	I saw men carrying guns.
5746734	eng	Tom mailed a letter home.
5746736	eng	I remember that we lost.
5746741	eng	I really can't top that.
5746743	eng	Tom lied to protect Mary.
5746744	eng	I pray for their safety.
5746752	eng	Tom learned to cook well.
5746759	eng	I know it takes courage.
5746760	eng	I know I'll feel better.
5746761	eng	Tom knows how to whistle.
5746763	eng	I just keep coming back.
5746764	eng	Tom kept on telling lies.
5746767	eng	Tom just made the change.
5746772	eng	I just enjoyed doing it.
5746773	eng	Tom jumped to the ground.
5746774	eng	I just couldn't go back.
5746776	eng	Tom isn't wearing a mask.
5746778	eng	I hope you'll pardon me.
5746779	eng	Tom is your headache now.
5746782	eng	Tom is very hard working.
5746783	eng	I haven't sold that one.
5746787	eng	I have to disagree here.
5746788	eng	Tom is the store manager.
5746789	eng	I have to choose wisely.
5746790	eng	I have to add something.
5746791	eng	Tom is the lead vocalist.
5746794	eng	Tom is the better choice.
5746797	eng	Tom is teaching here now.
5746798	eng	I had no support system.
5746799	eng	I got a little stronger.
5746800	eng	Tom is taking baby steps.
5746804	eng	I feel that's only fair.
5746806	eng	Tom is probably off duty.
5746808	eng	I feel a big difference.
5746810	eng	I don't think it's over.
5746811	eng	I don't think I'm alone.
5746814	eng	I don't see it changing.
5746815	eng	Tom is good at geography.
5746816	eng	I don't plan on dancing.
5746819	eng	I don't intend to dance.
5746824	eng	Tom is an easy target.
5746825	eng	I do everything by hand.
5746826	eng	I didn't try to respond.
5746827	eng	Tom is always winging it.
5746833	eng	Tom is accountable to me.
5746835	eng	I couldn't feel my legs.
5746838	eng	I couldn't ask for more.
5746840	eng	I could be way off-base.
5746845	eng	Tom is a tennis champion.
5746846	eng	I can't sleep all night.
5746847	eng	I can't say that enough.
5746848	eng	Tom is a police sergeant.
5746849	eng	I can't say for certain.
5746852	eng	I can't let them starve.
5746853	eng	I can't even fight back.
5746854	eng	Tom is a good campaigner.
5746855	eng	I can't even explain it.
5746856	eng	I can remember that day.
5746858	eng	I can live without them.
5746867	eng	I always was an atheist.
5746868	eng	I also want a bulldozer.
5746872	eng	Tom has seen better days.
5746874	eng	How'd you get into this?
5746876	eng	How would you like that?
5746877	eng	How was this worked out?
5746878	eng	Tom has reached his goal.
5746879	eng	How much are you making?
5746881	eng	Tom has no more strength.
5746882	eng	How many of those exist?
5746883	eng	How is that working out?
5746885	eng	How great would that be?
5746886	eng	How good is your memory?
5746887	eng	Tom has made a statement.
5746888	eng	How do you control that?
5746889	eng	How did you first react?
5746890	eng	Tom has learned a lesson.
5746891	eng	How cynical can you get?
5746892	eng	How can we protect them?
5746894	eng	How can we explain this?
5746896	eng	Tom has had an operation.
5746897	eng	How are you settling in?
5746898	eng	How are they holding up?
5746902	eng	Tom has changed his tune.
5746904	eng	Go see what's out there.
5746907	eng	Get off the golf course.
5746909	eng	Get back to your places.
5746913	eng	Find out what they said.
5746914	eng	Tom has a checkered past.
5746920	eng	Tom had to say something.
5746927	eng	Every day is a struggle.
5746929	eng	Tom had his own problems.
5746931	eng	Entry is free of charge.
5746936	eng	Don't think of it again.
5746938	eng	Tom had a weight problem.
5746939	eng	Don't give up too early.
5746940	eng	Does that appeal to you?
5746941	eng	Tom had a hard childhood.
5746942	eng	Does it ever bother you?
5746945	eng	Do you still drink milk?
5746946	eng	Do you love your family?
5746947	eng	Tom got life behind bars.
5746957	eng	Did you wash my uniform?
5746960	eng	Did you even check this?
5746961	eng	Did you clinch the deal?
5746962	eng	Tom fired into the crowd.
5746969	eng	Did anyone ask for that?
5746974	eng	Tom drives a light truck.
5746975	eng	Could it get any better?
5746976	eng	Could it almost be over?
5746977	eng	Tom dressed up as Batman.
5746979	eng	Clean out the glove box.
5746980	eng	Tom dreamed of going pro.
5746981	eng	Can you add that, please?
5746983	eng	Tom drank a sports drink.
5746984	eng	Call ahead to save time.
5746986	eng	Tom doesn't quite buy it.
5746987	eng	Boy, you sure showed me.
5746990	eng	Boston is the last stop.
5746992	eng	Tom does well in physics.
5746995	eng	Tom does nothing but cry.
5746997	eng	Are you really an alien?
5746999	eng	Are you proposing to me?
5747001	eng	Tom died by the roadside.
5747002	eng	Are you a family member?
5747003	eng	Are we together on this?
5747004	eng	Tom died at the hospital.
5747007	eng	Tom didn't take the bait.
5747008	eng	Are there guns in there?
5747009	eng	Anyway, I'm out of here.
5747010	eng	Tom didn't take a siesta.
5747011	eng	All you need is agility.
5747012	eng	All right, knock it off.
5747013	eng	Tom didn't see it coming.
5747018	eng	A patient of yours died.
5747020	eng	A friend dropped me off.
5747023	eng	You're very good to me.
5747024	eng	You're only a kid once.
5747026	eng	You're all that I have.
5747028	eng	Tom decided to head home.
5747029	eng	You must not read much.
5747031	eng	Tom decided to call Mary.
5747032	eng	You have to keep going.
5747033	eng	You have to dig deeper.
5747034	eng	Tom couldn't pull it off.
5747036	eng	Will anyone go to jail?
5747037	eng	Tom couldn't get it done.
5747038	eng	Why is this law needed?
5747042	eng	Who is really to blame?
5747044	eng	Who exactly is at risk?
5747045	eng	Who could make that up?
5747047	eng	Who could it have been?
5747048	eng	When we win, I'm happy.
5747049	eng	Tom cleared out his desk.
5747051	eng	What's up next for you?
5747052	eng	Tom chucked me the apple.
5747055	eng	Tom chose not to respond.
5747057	eng	What more need be said?
5747061	eng	Tom can't know the truth.
5747064	eng	Tom can't have heard you.
5747067	eng	Tom can surely afford it.
5747071	eng	We've lost so many men.
5747075	eng	We're not going to war.
5747076	eng	Tom blew me away tonight.
5747080	eng	We'll see how it works.
5747082	eng	Tom began to tickle Mary.
5747083	eng	We'll leave it at that.
5747084	eng	We'll have fun with it.
5747086	eng	We'll be there to help.
5747087	eng	We'll be in good shape.
5747088	eng	Tom became close to Mary.
5747089	eng	We weren't at our best.
5747090	eng	We were waiting for it.
5747091	eng	Tom became a drug dealer.
5747092	eng	We were still in shock.
5747096	eng	We were in our element.
5747108	eng	We never break the law.
5747110	eng	We need to play better.
5747117	eng	We lost a great friend.
5747119	eng	We just need to finish.
5747120	eng	We just have to adjust.
5747121	eng	The police picked Tom up.
5747122	eng	We have to accept that.
5747123	eng	We have the same agent.
5747124	eng	The choice is yours, Tom.
5747126	eng	We handle that as well.
5747127	eng	That's why I invited Tom.
5747128	eng	We got the same answer.
5747131	eng	We drove into the city.
5747133	eng	That's good to hear, Tom.
5747137	eng	We couldn't do a thing.
5747138	eng	We can't just sit back.
5747139	eng	Thanks for the note, Tom.
5747140	eng	We can't feed you here.
5747142	eng	Should we bring Tom home?
5747143	eng	Was that the only time?
5747145	eng	Should I put Tom through?
5747146	eng	Trust us to be careful.
5747153	eng	People blamed Tom for it.
5747155	eng	Time will be the judge.
5747157	eng	Those are hard to find.
5747162	eng	Let's do what Tom wishes.
5747164	eng	This isn't just for me.
5747165	eng	It was discovered by Tom.
5747166	eng	This is unusual for me.
5747171	eng	Is Tom prepared for this?
5747172	eng	This is perfect for me.
5747173	eng	This is only a preview.
5747175	eng	This is no longer true.
5747176	eng	This is just too weird.
5747178	eng	This is just pure evil.
5747179	eng	This is just an excuse.
5747181	eng	This is just a warning.
5747184	eng	This is a serious risk.
5747185	eng	This is a game changer.
5747186	eng	I'm still voting for Tom.
5747187	eng	This is a crying shame.
5747190	eng	This has been too much.
5747207	eng	I only casually know Tom.
5747210	eng	I mistook Mary for Alice.
5747217	eng	There was more to come.
5747220	eng	There is no one answer.
5747222	eng	I have recently seen Tom.
5747223	eng	The world has gone mad.
5747234	eng	I consider Tom my mentor.
5747238	eng	The men fled the scene.
5747239	eng	The law is quite clear.
5747241	eng	The house is very cold.
5747243	eng	Hand over the money, Tom.
5747245	eng	The first day was easy.
5747246	eng	Give Tom credit for that.
5747249	eng	Even Tom gave his assent.
5747254	eng	The barber cut my hair.
5747255	eng	Did Tom change his story?
5747256	eng	The answer would be no.
5747258	eng	Cookie was raised by Tom.
5747259	eng	That's what I want now.
5747260	eng	That's what I pray for.
5747262	eng	That's what I live for.
5747263	eng	That's out of my hands.
5747265	eng	That's as clear as mud.
5747267	eng	Who's going to beat Tom?
5747268	eng	That was the last time.
5747269	eng	That was a big shocker.
5747270	eng	Where did Tom come from?
5747272	eng	That might be too much.
5747273	eng	When will Tom fly again?
5747274	eng	That might be a factor.
5747275	eng	That meant a whole lot.
5747277	eng	That may not be likely.
5747278	eng	That makes three of us.
5747279	eng	We're lucky to have Tom.
5747281	eng	That just blew me away.
5747288	eng	We love having Tom back.
5747291	eng	Tom, you are 100% wrong.
5747292	eng	Thank you for any help.
5747295	eng	Stay calm and carry on.
5747299	eng	So why should you care?
5747301	eng	So who are you kidding?
5747302	eng	So what's next for you?
5747304	eng	So what should be done?
5747307	eng	Should you buy or rent?
5747308	eng	Should I eat more meat?
5747309	eng	Tom's dad has just died.
5747312	eng	Tom would go no further.
5747313	eng	Say only what you mean.
5747318	eng	Tom worked his butt off.
5747320	eng	Prison life is not fun.
5747321	eng	Tom worked as a teacher.
5747323	eng	Please give us a break.
5747324	eng	Tom worked as a laborer.
5747327	eng	Tom worked all the time.
5747330	eng	Tom won't take my calls.
5747331	eng	Place your trust in me.
5747333	eng	Tom won twice last year.
5747339	eng	Tom wiped the gun clean.
5747340	eng	One day it will happen.
5747342	eng	Tom will vouch for that.
5747348	eng	Tom will admit that now.
5747350	eng	No bomb was ever found.
5747351	eng	Tom went to Boston once.
5747353	eng	Money is a big problem.
5747354	eng	Tom went a step further.
5747356	eng	Life has changed a bit.
5747361	eng	Let's take a step back.
5747363	eng	Tom was suddenly a hero.
5747369	eng	Tom was stoned to death.
5747371	eng	Just don't count on it.
5747372	eng	Tom was paroled in 2013.
5747373	eng	It's what I love doing.
5747374	eng	It's very hard to tell.
5747376	eng	It's that time of year.
5747379	eng	It's pretty bad for us.
5747380	eng	It's one of those days.
5747381	eng	Tom was in good spirits.
5747382	eng	It's nothing new to me.
5747383	eng	It's not fun and games.
5747384	eng	Tom was happy to oblige.
5747388	eng	It's like the old days.
5747389	eng	It's like a horse race.
5747390	eng	Tom was frozen to death.
5747391	eng	It's kind of like that.
5747392	eng	It's got to be perfect.
5747394	eng	It's good to be wanted.
5747395	eng	It's flat as a pancake.
5747398	eng	It's either us or them.
5747399	eng	Tom was drunk and angry.
5747400	eng	It's better to be safe.
5747402	eng	Tom was doing just that.
5747403	eng	It's been rough for me.
5747404	eng	It's been fun to watch.
5747406	eng	It's been a great ride.
5747407	eng	It's a whole new world.
5747409	eng	It's a very tall order.
5747410	eng	It's a very good thing.
5747412	eng	It's a really good car.
5747413	eng	It's a really cool car.
5747415	eng	It's a little late now.
5747416	eng	It'll last for a while.
5747417	eng	Tom was a smooth talker.
5747419	eng	It wasn't a bad result.
5747420	eng	Tom was a real optimist.
5747425	eng	It was nice last night.
5747426	eng	Tom was a little hungry.
5747428	eng	It was just a disaster.
5747432	eng	Tom wants to come first.
5747434	eng	It was a moral victory.
5747436	eng	It was a little hectic.
5747437	eng	It was a great feeling.
5747438	eng	Tom wanted to adopt you.
5747439	eng	It was a fair argument.
5747440	eng	It was a different era.
5747441	eng	Tom vetoed his own plan.
5747442	eng	It was a crowd pleaser.
5747443	eng	It was a clear victory.
5747445	eng	It took me three years.
5747446	eng	It sure sounds like it.
5747448	eng	It sure seems that way.
5747449	eng	It sure looks that way.
5747451	eng	It sure isn't worth it.
5747452	eng	It still blows my mind.
5747456	eng	Tom turned and ran away.
5747458	eng	It never hurts to look.
5747459	eng	Tom tried to leave once.
5747461	eng	It must seem like that.
5747462	eng	Tom took out a notebook.
5747463	eng	It makes you feel good.
5747465	eng	Tom took my breath away.
5747466	eng	It makes my skin crawl.
5747469	eng	It just broke my heart.
5747470	eng	It doesn't hurt to ask.
5747471	eng	Tom told Mary to change.
5747475	eng	It can't end like this.
5747476	eng	Is this the right time?
5747479	eng	Is this a rare problem?
5747481	eng	Is this a common thing?
5747482	eng	Is that asking so much?
5747484	eng	Is it in working order?
5747485	eng	Is any of it dangerous?
5747489	eng	Tom struggled to get up.
5747492	eng	Tom stayed where he was.
5747493	eng	I've done it both ways.
5747495	eng	Tom stayed in the truck.
5747499	eng	I'm tired of this mess.
5747500	eng	I'm thrilled to see it.
5747501	eng	Tom spoke to Mary again.
5747503	eng	I'm still in your debt.
5747505	eng	I'm sort of a tightwad.
5747506	eng	I'm sitting on my cash.
5747507	eng	Tom sings like an angel.
5747508	eng	I'm ready to accept it.
5747516	eng	I'm not going for that.
5747517	eng	Tom seems a little down.
5747518	eng	I'm not getting my way.
5747520	eng	Tom says what he thinks.
5747522	eng	I'm not a vocal person.
5747525	eng	I'm here and I'm happy.
5747526	eng	Tom saw the whole thing.
5747527	eng	I'm happy for the guys.
5747530	eng	I'm glad you were born.
5747532	eng	Tom saved my son's life.
5747534	eng	I'm back in my bedroom.
5747540	eng	I'll never be the same.
5747546	eng	I'll get to that later.
5747547	eng	Tom remains out on bail.
5747551	eng	I'll be wearing a veil.
5747552	eng	I'll be strong for you.
5747555	eng	I'd say yes, of course.
5747557	eng	I'd rather not be busy.
5747558	eng	I'd rather go to sleep.
5747561	eng	I'd go along with that.
5747562	eng	Tom quickly got to work.
5747563	eng	I'd be lost without it.
5747564	eng	I write all the lyrics.
5747569	eng	I wasn't going to sing.
5747576	eng	I was praying for rain.
5747577	eng	Tom never could do that.
5747579	eng	I was led by curiosity.
5747580	eng	Tom needs to study more.
5747585	eng	I was inside the plane.
5747586	eng	Tom needs to address it.
5747592	eng	Tom may spill the beans.
5747595	eng	Tom may now be deported.
5747604	eng	Tom loves the new house.
5747606	eng	I used to look younger.
5747611	eng	I turned out all right.
5747612	eng	I try to keep positive.
5747613	eng	Tom looked back at Mary.
5747614	eng	I took advantage of it.
5747616	eng	Tom lived a simple life.
5747619	eng	Tom lived a lonely life.
5747621	eng	I talked to the owners.
5747622	eng	Tom likes to eat cheese.
5747624	eng	I spent my youth there.
5747625	eng	Tom left the room angry.
5747628	eng	Tom left Mary in Boston.
5747629	eng	I see no easy solution.
5747631	eng	Tom leapt over the wall.
5747634	eng	Tom leads a hectic life.
5747639	eng	I refuse to file taxes.
5747640	eng	Tom knew this was wrong.
5747641	eng	I recently left my job.
5747643	eng	Tom knew that all along.
5747644	eng	I needed time to think.
5747646	eng	Tom just wanted to know.
5747647	eng	I need a support group.
5747649	eng	Tom jumped on the train.
5747650	eng	I may decide to retire.
5747652	eng	Tom jumped into his car.
5747653	eng	I love to be sarcastic.
5747655	eng	Tom isn't worthy of you.
5747656	eng	I know it sounds crazy.
5747659	eng	I know all our clients.
5747661	eng	Tom isn't tall like you.
5747663	eng	I knew the real reason.
5747665	eng	I just stay inside now.
5747669	eng	I hope it happens here.
5747670	eng	Tom isn't alone in this.
5747671	eng	I heard an awful crash.
5747672	eng	I have to face reality.
5747673	eng	Tom isn't a joke teller.
5747674	eng	I have really bad eyes.
5747675	eng	I have no more secrets.
5747678	eng	I have a decent income.
5747681	eng	I got pretty banged up.
5747684	eng	I finally found a home.
5747686	eng	I felt like a slumlord.
5747688	eng	Tom is tight with money.
5747689	eng	I dropped to the floor.
5747690	eng	I don't want a handout.
5747692	eng	I don't think that way.
5747693	eng	I don't sleep at night.
5747695	eng	I don't see a conflict.
5747698	eng	I don't need the money.
5747699	eng	I don't know right now.
5747700	eng	Tom is rolling in money.
5747701	eng	I don't know much more.
5747703	eng	Tom is quite the talker.
5747704	eng	I couldn't let you win.
5747705	eng	I couldn't do the math.
5747707	eng	I could've told you so.
5747709	eng	Tom is only half joking.
5747710	eng	I could live with that.
5747711	eng	I can't make that call.
5747713	eng	I can never repay them.
5747715	eng	Tom is nervous about it.
5747717	eng	I agree with you there.
5747718	eng	Tom is making it happen.
5747719	eng	I agree on both points.
5747720	eng	How will that turn out?
5747723	eng	How stupid can you get?
5747726	eng	How is that any better?
5747727	eng	Tom is hungry for power.
5747731	eng	How dumb would that be?
5747734	eng	How could it be better?
5747735	eng	How cool would that be?
5747737	eng	How can you control it?
5747741	eng	Here's how to stay fit.
5747743	eng	Have you seen the film?
5747745	eng	Tom is crazy about jazz.
5747748	eng	Tom is back to teaching.
5747753	eng	Get ready to be amazed.
5747758	eng	Explain that one to me.
5747765	eng	Tom is an expert driver.
5747767	eng	Everyone now has a gun.
5747768	eng	Tom is an arrogant jerk.
5747771	eng	Tom is an able engineer.
5747777	eng	Tom is a true sportsman.
5747780	eng	Tom is a ski instructor.
5747783	eng	Tom is a policy adviser.
5747785	eng	Did you have any doubt?
5747786	eng	Tom is a master teacher.
5747788	eng	Cost is a bigger issue.
5747789	eng	Tom is a country singer.
5747792	eng	Tom is a branch manager.
5747797	eng	Can we admit it's good?
5747799	eng	Can someone fill me in?
5747803	eng	Boston is going to win.
5747804	eng	Tom held up the lantern.
5747806	eng	Best of luck with that.
5747807	eng	Tom has totally lost it.
5747809	eng	Are you sure this time?
5747811	eng	Are you stupid or what?
5747812	eng	Are we in the minority?
5747817	eng	A new year brings hope.
5747818	eng	A date hasn't been set.
5747820	eng	Your time is your own.
5747825	eng	Tom has nothing to fear.
5747829	eng	You may not last long.
5747830	eng	You know it wasn't me.
5747832	eng	You have to watch out.
5747833	eng	You have to accept it.
5747834	eng	Tom has agreed to speak.
5747837	eng	Tom has a large mansion.
5747839	eng	You can't rule it out.
5747840	eng	Tom has a good appetite.
5747843	eng	Tom had to admit defeat.
5747844	eng	You can have it today.
5747845	eng	Why would I be bitter?
5747850	eng	Why did you choose it?
5747856	eng	Who the devil are you?
5747857	eng	Who can be against it?
5747858	eng	Tom had a radiant smile.
5747863	eng	What's to be our fate?
5747867	eng	Tom got elected in 2013.
5747870	eng	Tom froze in his tracks.
5747875	eng	What was the big news?
5747876	eng	Tom fought a good fight.
5747877	eng	What time shall we go?
5747879	eng	Tom faints all the time.
5747880	eng	What good has it done?
5747882	eng	Tom even wrote me poems.
5747886	eng	What am I thinking of?
5747887	eng	What am I saying here?
5747888	eng	Tom drove into the town.
5747889	eng	We're well on our way.
5747893	eng	We're so much in love.
5747896	eng	We're not in sync yet.
5747906	eng	Tom died a heroic death.
5747909	eng	Tom didn't utter a word.
5747917	eng	We were on a schedule.
5747920	eng	We want to keep going.
5747923	eng	We want to be friends.
5747925	eng	We want it really bad.
5747928	eng	We thought we lost it.
5747929	eng	We share in your loss.
5747930	eng	Tom decided to go there.
5747933	eng	Tom cried his heart out.
5747934	eng	We played a good game.
5747938	eng	We may never find out.
5747943	eng	We lasted a long time.
5747946	eng	We know this for sure.
5747949	eng	We just met our match.
5747950	eng	We just kept on going.
5747955	eng	We have to protect it.
5747956	eng	We have to have focus.
5747957	eng	Tom can only get better.
5747958	eng	We have to check that.
5747962	eng	We have a unique bond.
5747965	eng	We have a great squad.
5747966	eng	Tom began to cry loudly.
5747967	eng	We get together a lot.
5747972	eng	Tom and I are soulmates.
5747974	eng	We couldn't not do it.
5747976	eng	We caught a big break.
5747986	eng	We all hate the young.
5747987	eng	That's why Tom is suing.
5747988	eng	Wait until you see it.
5747989	eng	Use any name you like.
5747990	eng	That's the risk Tom ran.
5747993	eng	It's a promise Tom kept.
5747994	eng	Time is the only cure.
5747998	eng	This might be the way.
5748004	eng	This isn't a bad team.
5748005	eng	I've seen plenty of Tom.
5748006	eng	This is what you said.
5748007	eng	This is the best idea.
5748008	eng	I'm going home with Tom.
5748009	eng	This is such a bummer.
5748010	eng	This is so very wrong.
5748011	eng	I'm ashamed of you, Tom.
5748013	eng	This is quite a story.
5748015	eng	This is no small task.
5748016	eng	This is my third year.
5748018	eng	This is my third wish.
5748019	eng	This is a tough issue.
5748021	eng	This is a real threat.
5748022	eng	This is a great honor.
5748024	eng	This is a great class.
5748029	eng	I paid attention to Tom.
5748032	eng	I loved all Tom's songs.
5748036	eng	They were acts of war.
5748037	eng	They support me a lot.
5748038	eng	I fully support Tom now.
5748040	eng	They must all go away.
5748041	eng	I don't see Tom dancing.
5748045	eng	They came to fight us.
5748047	eng	I consider Tom a mentor.
5748049	eng	There was a loud bang.
5748055	eng	The trash is now gone.
5748140	eng	Find out more about Tom.
5748147	eng	The price tag is high.
5748155	eng	You've got to like Tom.
5748157	eng	The law is very clear.
5748158	eng	Where would Tom fit in?
5748160	eng	The free ride is over.
5748161	eng	Where did Tom go wrong?
5748176	eng	We'll do as Tom wishes.
5748177	eng	The FBI was called in.
5748178	eng	That's why I wrote it.
5748179	eng	We want the truth, Tom.
5748180	eng	That's what I look at.
5748182	eng	We never saw Tom again.
5748183	eng	That's how we grew up.
5748184	eng	That's all I live for.
5748190	eng	That was an easy call.
5748192	eng	That was a tough call.
5748193	eng	That was a nice touch.
5748194	eng	Tom, I'm in your hands.
5748195	eng	That was a great call.
5748196	eng	That was a good thing.
5748199	eng	That seems high to me.
5748210	eng	That bothers us a lot.
5748211	eng	That I must look into.
5748213	eng	That I can't tell you.
5748218	eng	Tom works his butt off.
5748224	eng	Tom won't find it easy.
5748228	eng	Please try to move on.
5748230	eng	Tom went to the window.
5748240	eng	Pay for your own food.
5748241	eng	Pardon me while I gag.
5748242	eng	Tom was really into it.
5748245	eng	Tom was ready for more.
5748246	eng	Now come on and fight.
5748248	eng	Tom was pretty bad off.
5748251	eng	Tom was no help either.
5748252	eng	No one there was hurt.
5748253	eng	No one shouted at you.
5748255	eng	No one knows about it.
5748256	eng	No new date was given.
5748258	eng	No need to exploit it.
5748260	eng	Tom was just plain fat.
5748263	eng	Tom was just being Tom.
5748266	eng	Tom was just behind me.
5748269	eng	Tom was happy for Mary.
5748272	eng	Tom was hanged in 2013.
5748275	eng	Tom was given the post.
5748276	eng	Maybe now is the time.
5748277	eng	Maybe I have it wrong.
5748278	eng	Tom was counting on it.
5748280	eng	Life in jail is tough.
5748281	eng	Tom was carrying a gun.
5748283	eng	Let's not ease up now.
5748286	eng	Let's keep up to date.
5748287	eng	Tom was always with me.
5748288	eng	Let's go for a coffee.
5748290	eng	Tom was a little tired.
5748291	eng	Let me argue the case.
5748292	eng	Lead is a toxic metal.
5748298	eng	It's too early to say.
5748299	eng	Tom tried to hurt Mary.
5748300	eng	It's time we moved on.
5748302	eng	Tom tried to defend me.
5748304	eng	It's not an easy call.
5748306	eng	It's not a pipe dream.
5748307	eng	It's a matter of choice.
5748309	eng	It's gone on too long.
5748310	eng	It's going to pay off.
5748311	eng	Tom told us he escaped.
5748312	eng	It's going to be ugly.
5748313	eng	It's going to be nice.
5748314	eng	Tom threw in the towel.
5748315	eng	It's for a good cause.
5748317	eng	Tom takes me to school.
5748319	eng	It's been good so far.
5748320	eng	Tom studied on his own.
5748321	eng	It's been good for me.
5748330	eng	It would be great fun.
5748334	eng	It was the wrong call.
5748336	eng	It was the right call.
5748337	eng	It was such a letdown.
5748341	eng	Tom said what he meant.
5748344	eng	Tom said goodbye to me.
5748346	eng	It was puzzling to me.
5748353	eng	Tom passed me the salt.
5748354	eng	It was clearly a foul.
5748355	eng	It tears me up inside.
5748356	eng	Tom paid for my lawyer.
5748357	eng	It taught me a lesson.
5748359	eng	Tom owes Mary big time.
5748361	eng	It really shook me up.
5748362	eng	Tom never went to jail.
5748366	eng	It really bums me out.
5748368	eng	Tom never made it home.
5748371	eng	Tom never had an enemy.
5748372	eng	It made my heart sink.
5748373	eng	It kind of helped out.
5748374	eng	Tom needs to find Mary.
5748375	eng	It just wasn't my day.
5748376	eng	It just makes me sick.
5748378	eng	It just blows me away.
5748382	eng	It feels like a setup.
5748385	eng	It can only get worse.
5748386	eng	Tom made a great catch.
5748391	eng	Is it worth the money?
5748392	eng	Tom lives off the grid.
5748395	eng	Tom lived to be ninety.
5748397	eng	I've grown to love it.
5748398	eng	Tom lived a happy life.
5748399	eng	I've got to be strong.
5748400	eng	I've got to be honest.
5748405	eng	I've been in the dark.
5748408	eng	I've become a new man.
5748411	eng	I've always had a job.
5748413	eng	Tom kept the door open.
5748415	eng	I'm very sad for them.
5748416	eng	Tom kept staring at me.
5748421	eng	I'm told it went well.
5748423	eng	I'm tired of the game.
5748425	eng	Tom jumped up in alarm.
5748426	eng	I'm sure I don't know.
5748427	eng	I'm still a young guy.
5748428	eng	Tom jumped off a cliff.
5748429	eng	I'm ready to pass out.
5748430	eng	I'm on the right team.
5748431	eng	Tom isn't off the hook.
5748434	eng	Tom isn't kind to Mary.
5748467	eng	Behind her smile lies betrayal.
5748476	eng	Will you keep your promise?
5748830	eng	I didn't buy this book.
5748984	eng	I'm not able to speak.
5748985	eng	I'm not a nice person.
5748986	eng	Tom is willing to talk.
5748987	eng	I'm more mad than sad.
5748988	eng	I'm just here to work.
5749279	eng	Are cats smarter than dogs?
5749325	eng	How expensive a piano is!
5749465	eng	The stars are out tonight.
5749466	eng	The stars are bright tonight.
5749801	eng	Tom set up the tent.
5749816	eng	I just laughed it off.
5749817	eng	Tom just laughed it off.
5749818	eng	She just laughed it off.
5749823	eng	Are you two really dating?
5749866	eng	That's too expensive for me.
5749868	eng	I wish I'd known that.
5749916	eng	I couldn't believe my ears.
5749920	eng	He arrived before the rest.
5749968	eng	He couldn't do any better.
5751060	eng	Did you see my boyfriend?
5751061	eng	Did you see my girlfriend?
5751280	eng	They were talking about you.
5751282	eng	Tom has a fake ID.
5751284	eng	Mary has a fake ID.
5751377	eng	The clutch isn't working right.
5751671	eng	You'll have enough to do.
5751705	eng	Tom has enough to say.
5751751	eng	Tom wanted Mary to come.
5751831	eng	They are talking among themselves.
5751895	eng	I don't have to go.
5751903	eng	Tom, stay in your seat!
5751912	eng	I'm happy you have it.
5751913	eng	I'm going to lose you.
5751914	eng	Tom is the real winner.
5751915	eng	I'm going to die here.
5751916	eng	I'm going to be happy.
5751917	eng	Tom is sure of success.
5751918	eng	I'm glad I watched it.
5751920	eng	Tom is such a scalawag.
5751921	eng	I'm dying to see them.
5751924	eng	I'm away from my kids.
5751930	eng	I'm about to throw up.
5751933	eng	I'll leave it at that.
5751936	eng	I'll be clear for you.
5751937	eng	I'll be a team player.
5751938	eng	Tom is small but tough.
5751939	eng	I'd like to know, too.
5751942	eng	I'd hate to pay again.
5751945	eng	I would beg to differ.
5751946	eng	I won't take the bait.
5751948	eng	I wasn't used to that.
5751950	eng	Tom is quite shaken up.
5751954	eng	I was sick with worry.
5751955	eng	I was really fired up.
5751956	eng	Tom is putting on airs.
5751957	eng	I was once a prisoner.
5751961	eng	I was happy to oblige.
5751962	eng	Tom is patient with me.
5751963	eng	I was getting to that.
5751964	eng	I was afraid to check.
5751965	eng	Tom is out of position.
5751966	eng	I wanted to work hard.
5751968	eng	Tom is on fire tonight.
5751969	eng	I think you nailed it.
5751970	eng	I think that helps me.
5751975	eng	I think it'll pay off.
5751976	eng	I think it would work.
5751977	eng	Tom is just plum crazy.
5751978	eng	I think I'm over that.
5751979	eng	I think I'll run away.
5751980	eng	Tom is in great demand.
5751981	eng	I still think of them.
5751982	eng	I still agree with it.
5751983	eng	Tom is in grave danger.
5751987	eng	I play lots of sports.
5751988	eng	I never quit the band.
5751989	eng	Tom is guilty of theft.
5751990	eng	I never had to choose.
5751991	eng	I never counted on it.
5751992	eng	Tom is guilty of fraud.
5751993	eng	I need milk and sugar.
5751995	eng	Tom is green with envy.
5751996	eng	I may know this woman.
5752002	eng	I know this very well.
5752003	eng	I just told the truth.
5752006	eng	I just don't get golf.
5752007	eng	Tom is an eager beaver.
5752008	eng	I hope you all suffer.
5752009	eng	I hope they choose us.
5752011	eng	I hope they accept it.
5752016	eng	Tom is a versatile kid.
5752019	eng	Tom is a true champion.
5752021	eng	I have a good feeling.
5752022	eng	Tom is a true believer.
5752023	eng	I hate to correct you.
5752024	eng	I hate myself as well.
5752026	eng	I guess I'll find out.
5752027	eng	I grew up with horses.
5752028	eng	Tom is a little unsure.
5752029	eng	I get tired of losing.
5752030	eng	I gave myself a month.
5752031	eng	Tom is a great fighter.
5752032	eng	I find the timing odd.
5752034	eng	Tom is a computer nerd.
5752035	eng	I feel young at heart.
5752037	eng	Tom is a complete fool.
5752039	eng	I can't lie to myself.
5752042	eng	I can't comment on it.
5752043	eng	Tom ignored me all day.
5752044	eng	I can honestly say no.
5752045	eng	I can feel their pain.
5752051	eng	I agree with you here.
5752055	eng	Tom hasn't yet been in.
5752056	eng	How do you make money?
5752057	eng	How did you choose it?
5752058	eng	Tom has too many books.
5752060	eng	How could I not worry?
5752061	eng	Tom has to decide soon.
5752062	eng	How can you not laugh?
5752063	eng	How can we rank these?
5752065	eng	How can we explain it?
5752066	eng	How can this not work?
5752067	eng	Tom has overcome a lot.
5752068	eng	How can I help myself?
5752069	eng	How can I handle this?
5752075	eng	Have you ever seen it?
5752076	eng	Tom has made it happen.
5752077	eng	Have we sunk that low?
5752084	eng	Glad to have you back.
5752088	eng	Tom had the last laugh.
5752097	eng	Tom had a minor injury.
5752100	eng	Tom had a little money.
5752106	eng	Tom got life in prison.
5752107	eng	Even the dog ran away.
5752111	eng	Do you have flat feet?
5752114	eng	Do you have any stock?
5752116	eng	Do we really need you?
5752121	eng	Tom drives a tow truck.
5752125	eng	Cost is also a factor.
5752127	eng	Tom died in the battle.
5752130	eng	Tom didn't vote for me.
5752133	eng	Tom didn't miss a beat.
5752134	eng	Can you make me happy?
5752135	eng	Can you do the splits?
5752140	eng	Bring a dish to share.
5752142	eng	Tom couldn't let it go.
5752144	eng	Be sure to mention it.
5752146	eng	Be proud of your work.
5752148	eng	Tom could take no more.
5752150	eng	Are you crazy or what?
5752152	eng	Are we off the record?
5752155	eng	Anyone can talk to me.
5752159	eng	Add rice and mix well.
5752160	eng	Tom can relate to that.
5752163	eng	Tom can read very well.
5752171	eng	You owe us that much.
5752173	eng	You need to speak up.
5752174	eng	You might go to jail.
5752175	eng	Tom blew all his money.
5752176	eng	You make me so happy.
5752177	eng	You know you love it.
5752178	eng	Tom bit into the apple.
5752184	eng	Tom behaved like a man.
5752185	eng	Why is this an issue?
5752187	eng	Tom began to get angry.
5752196	eng	Tom asked Mary her age.
5752197	eng	Who wants me to know?
5752199	eng	Tom and Mary knew this.
5752205	eng	The big problem is Tom.
5752208	eng	The baby was named Tom.
5752211	eng	So what's next for Tom?
5752212	eng	What was the hold up?
5752213	eng	What must be must be.
5752214	eng	Say it isn't true, Tom.
5752215	eng	What more can we say?
5752218	eng	What if they said no?
5752219	eng	What else can we say?
5752220	eng	It's good news for Tom.
5752221	eng	Were you a funny kid?
5752226	eng	It was invented by Tom.
5752229	eng	Is Tom asking too much?
5752232	eng	I'm with you 100%, Tom.
5752235	eng	I'm super proud of Tom.
5752238	eng	I'm going to marry Tom.
5752241	eng	I think Tom was misled.
5752244	eng	I think Tom got banned.
5752245	eng	We're all sick of it.
5752247	eng	I see Tom's point here.
5752250	eng	I've given up on Tom.
5752259	eng	How good was Tom today?
5752262	eng	Exactly how bad is Tom?
5752265	eng	Don't be so hasty, Tom.
5752267	eng	We were in the woods.
5752268	eng	Can Tom close the deal?
5752270	eng	We still have a shot.
5752274	eng	You have to trust Tom.
5752277	eng	Why is Tom so adamant?
5752280	eng	We must not blame Tom.
5752282	eng	We need an air force.
5752283	eng	Tom's place is a dump.
5752287	eng	We let them have fun.
5752288	eng	We know it very well.
5752290	eng	We knew it was there.
5752296	eng	We had some fun, too.
5752299	eng	We had a lousy start.
5752300	eng	We had a good season.
5752307	eng	Tom will deal with it.
5752309	eng	We cried for a while.
5752310	eng	Tom will appear on TV.
5752312	eng	We can't sit idly by.
5752314	eng	We can't have it all.
5752321	eng	We all went to sleep.
5752324	eng	Try and bear with us.
5752332	eng	This one is too easy.
5752333	eng	This one is a keeper.
5752336	eng	This list is for you.
5752337	eng	Tom was right at home.
5752338	eng	This is what you get.
5752339	eng	This is the fun part.
5752342	eng	This is no easy task.
5752343	eng	Tom was old and frail.
5752348	eng	This is kind of lame.
5752350	eng	This is here to stay.
5752351	eng	This is great for us.
5752353	eng	This is good to know.
5752355	eng	Tom was listed as MIA.
5752358	eng	Tom was in good shape.
5752361	eng	Tom was great at that.
5752364	eng	Tom was good as usual.
5752370	eng	Tom was a serious guy.
5752373	eng	Tom was a popular guy.
5752376	eng	Tom was a nice person.
5752378	eng	They know who it was.
5752379	eng	Tom was a little nuts.
5752385	eng	Tom wanted to kill me.
5752386	eng	They had a good life.
5752388	eng	Tom took it very well.
5752391	eng	Tom took it in stride.
5752394	eng	Tom threw a hissy fit.
5752397	eng	Tom tells a good joke.
5752406	eng	Tom stuck to his guns.
5752409	eng	Tom still has an edge.
5752416	eng	The man fled on foot.
5752424	eng	Tom should pay for it.
5752425	eng	That's up in the air.
5752431	eng	That would be a plus.
5752442	eng	Tom seems to hate you.
5752466	eng	Tom ran into the shop.
5752469	eng	Tom put his head down.
5752472	eng	Tom put his foot down.
5752478	eng	Tom plans to be there.
5752480	eng	No one saw it coming.
5752483	eng	Nice to see you back.
5752484	eng	Tom owns both of them.
5752487	eng	Tom never did go away.
5752490	eng	Tom needs to back off.
5752493	eng	Tom needs put in jail.
5752499	eng	Tom might pull it off.
5752670	eng	I got home late yesterday.
5752794	eng	Carp is my favorite fish.
5752895	eng	Pleased to meet you, Tom.
5753198	eng	Let's just go for it.
5753199	eng	Let me be very clear.
5753200	eng	Tom may pull that off.
5753207	eng	It's too much to ask.
5753208	eng	It's time to grow up.
5753214	eng	It's helped us a lot.
5753217	eng	It's all ready to go.
5753221	eng	Tom likes to eat well.
5753224	eng	Tom left for a second.
5753233	eng	Tom laid down the gun.
5753237	eng	It was a great break.
5753239	eng	Tom kind of went nuts.
5753243	eng	It seemed to go well.
5753244	eng	It never pays to lie.
5753246	eng	It may cost me votes.
5753253	eng	It just blew me away.
5753256	eng	It goes with the job.
5753257	eng	Tom isn't what he was.
5753260	eng	Tom isn't in the mood.
5753262	eng	It blew my socks off.
5753264	eng	It all didn't add up.
5753267	eng	Is there a third way?
5753268	eng	Is that what you see?
5753271	eng	Is that a fair value?
5753273	eng	Is it right or wrong?
5753274	eng	Is it better to sell?
5753275	eng	Tom is the worst ever.
5753278	eng	Tom is the drum major.
5753280	eng	I'm with you on this.
5753282	eng	I'm very proud of it.
5753286	eng	I'm proud to be here.
5753287	eng	Tom is still at large.
5753291	eng	I'm not the only one.
5753292	eng	I'm not a US citizen.
5753294	eng	I'm not OK with this.
5753296	eng	Tom is small and weak.
5753300	eng	I'm also glad we met.
5753303	eng	I'll put money on it.
5753306	eng	I worked my butt off.
5753307	eng	I worked hard for it.
5753308	eng	Tom is quick to agree.
5753310	eng	I wish I were faster.
5753311	eng	Tom is precious to us.
5753313	eng	I was right up there.
5753316	eng	I was just out there.
5753317	eng	Tom is out of options.
5753318	eng	I was hard on myself.
5753319	eng	I was born like this.
5753323	eng	Tom is merely a child.
5753325	eng	I want to move ahead.
5753330	eng	I tidied up the room.
5753331	eng	I thought it went OK.
5753333	eng	I thought I was dead.
5753335	eng	Tom is devoted to you.
5753337	eng	I think of you often.
5753340	eng	I think I would pass.
5753343	eng	I still want to play.
5753345	eng	I sobered up in 2013.
5753346	eng	I sleep at night now.
5753349	eng	I sense a plot afoot.
5753350	eng	Tom is beating a drum.
5753352	eng	I never will like it.
5753353	eng	Tom is an amazing guy.
5753354	eng	I never wanted to go.
5753356	eng	Tom is an able lawyer.
5753357	eng	I need a cold shower.

5753367	eng	I love to make films.
5753368	eng	Tom is a staff writer.
5753371	eng	Tom is a real oddball.
5753373	eng	I looked at the trap.
5753376	eng	I like bourbon a lot.
5753377	eng	Tom is a little rusty.
5753379	eng	I know that for sure.
5753380	eng	Tom is a great writer.
5753381	eng	I know I'm a failure.
5753382	eng	I knew this was real.
5753383	eng	Tom is a great choice.
5753384	eng	I knew I needed that.
5753385	eng	I just lost my nerve.
5753386	eng	Tom is a great artist.
5753389	eng	Tom is a charming man.
5753390	eng	I just felt so awful.
5753392	eng	Tom helps out as well.
5753401	eng	Tom hasn't won a race.
5753402	eng	I had a good feeling.
5753404	eng	Tom has very bad luck.
5753416	eng	Tom has lost all hope.
5753418	eng	I come from far away.
5753420	eng	I chose to come here.
5753423	eng	I can live with this.
5753426	eng	I asked God for help.
5753427	eng	I admit I've done it.
5753429	eng	How's it been so far?
5753431	eng	Tom has a chubby face.
5753433	eng	How secure is my job?
5753434	eng	Tom had to think fast.
5753435	eng	How lucky can one be?
5753436	eng	How long has it been?
5753439	eng	How do I handle this?
5753440	eng	Tom had lost all hope.
5753441	eng	How did they stop it?
5753443	eng	Tom had a great match.
5753446	eng	Tom had a good dinner.
5753449	eng	Tom got us nice seats.
5753452	eng	Tom got back into bed.
5753453	eng	God bless all of you.
5753454	eng	Go easy on the booze.
5753458	eng	Tom gave us our break.
5753461	eng	Tom gave Mary the gun.
5753467	eng	Tom gave Mary a towel.
5753469	eng	Do I need to explain?
5753483	eng	Can we have a minute?
5753486	eng	Can it get any worse?
5753488	eng	Tom died the next day.
5753490	eng	Believe me, I get it.
5753491	eng	Tom died in the fight.
5753492	eng	Are you in the sauna?
5753494	eng	Tom died in the blaze.
5753496	eng	Am I really that old?
5753567	eng	Tom died a week later.
5753569	eng	Age is just a number.
5753571	eng	A shelter was set up.
5753572	eng	A dollar is a dollar.
5753579	eng	Tom did no such thing.
5753584	eng	You have to say yes.
5753586	eng	You have to keep up.
5753590	eng	You had to be there.
5753593	eng	You can work it out.
5753594	eng	Tom could use a raise.
5753596	eng	You can bet on that.
5753610	eng	What work do you do?
5753613	eng	What shape is it in?
5753618	eng	Tom can tell you that.
5753624	eng	Tom came at six sharp.
5753722	eng	We were ready to go.
5753725	eng	We were born to die.
5753732	eng	We put them in jail.
5753733	eng	The same goes for Tom.
5753736	eng	That's when I met Tom.
5753738	eng	We need you to stop.
5753740	eng	We need to back off.
5753745	eng	It's too late for Tom.
5753746	eng	We need all of them.
5753747	eng	We need a win badly.
5753751	eng	I used to support Tom.
5753752	eng	We made our own fun.
5753766	eng	I met Tom last spring.
5753769	eng	I met Tom decades ago.
5753918	eng	I dressed up like Tom.
5753920	eng	We can't pay for it.
5753921	eng	I caught sight of Tom.
5753922	eng	We can look into it.
5753924	eng	How will Tom cope now?
5753927	eng	How proud Tom must be.
5753930	eng	How long can Tom last?
5753933	eng	How can Tom know that?
5753936	eng	Even Tom had to laugh.
5753939	eng	Did you kiss Tom back?
5753941	eng	This is a new trend.
5753942	eng	Did Tom have a stroke?
5753945	eng	Can we take Tom alive?
5753960	eng	What if Tom is alive?
5754008	eng	This recipe requires acorn squash.
5754217	eng	She has never been there.
5754306	eng	Give me the magazine, please.
5754333	eng	Tom, what do you say?
5754336	eng	Tom, what can you do?
5754348	eng	Tom works hard at it.
5754360	eng	Tom will do the same.
5754363	eng	Tom will be the host.
5754378	eng	Tom was the best man.
5754436	eng	That's a big fat no.
5754437	eng	Tom was ready to run.
5754440	eng	Tom was put to death.
5754444	eng	That was a fun game.
5754446	eng	Tom was part of that.
5754461	eng	Tom was in bad shape.
5754464	eng	Tom was crying a lot.
5754471	eng	Put your name on it.
5754473	eng	Tom was born a slave.

5828224	eng	We're gonna have a baby.
5828229	eng	You have to face it.
5828242	eng	You two are really inseparable.
5828243	eng	It's probably that plumber again.
5828248	eng	You need a short break.
5828256	eng	I can see it now.
5828260	eng	What happened to that man?
5828261	eng	What's all this about, guys?
5828269	eng	I'll invite her for dinner.
5828271	eng	Cut it out, will you?
5828279	eng	What happened to me, guys?
5828282	eng	He tried to kill us.
5828283	eng	You're thinking of unimportant things.
5828286	eng	I can't accept this present.
5828289	eng	I'll open it for you.
5828303	eng	I'm extremely busy this afternoon.
5828307	eng	Somebody is looking for you.
5828314	eng	I can't leave the office.
5828323	eng	I was in the bathroom.
5828327	eng	I've never had a boyfriend.
5828329	eng	Most men find me ugly.
5828339	eng	It wasn't the right moment.
5828343	eng	That's what we don't know.
5828351	eng	Is she talking to herself?
5828353	eng	Are you spying on us?
5828371	eng	I'm afraid of being betrayed.
5828373	eng	I wanna try it again.
5828383	eng	I just received your card.
5828386	eng	Is there anything wrong, sir?
5828393	eng	We have to talk, Jamal.
5828448	eng	I can't leave you there.
5828461	eng	I'm so afraid of him.
5828470	eng	Sarah is naive and gullible.
5828475	eng	I hope you can understand.
5828476	eng	Why are you here, Jamal?
5828478	eng	You're my lovely little baby.
5828480	eng	It seems weird to me.
5828481	eng	What if it was serious?
5828482	eng	Tell me about it, Jamal.
5828484	eng	Jamal arrived in a taxi.
5828485	eng	He's going to his room.
5828495	eng	"May I go?" "Very well."
5828497	eng	Jamal went to his room.
5828500	eng	Just say Jamal isn't here.
5828507	eng	These flowers are for you.
5828509	eng	Give me your hand, Jamal.
5828510	eng	The wedding ring fits perfectly.
5828524	eng	Running was my only defense.
5828525	eng	We don't want it anymore.
5828531	eng	We had hundreds of fights.
5828539	eng	I got a good job.
5828556	eng	You're the boss. You decided.
5828563	eng	Do you need help, buddy?
5828572	eng	That's no way to live.
5828582	eng	Things have changed a bit.
5828597	eng	The meals were on time.
5828599	eng	Our clothes were always clean.
5828600	eng	We call her the general.
5828602	eng	I know something isn't right.
5828604	eng	We got ahead in life.
5828605	eng	There was love and respect.
5828711	eng	Living without Jamal is unthinkable.
5828713	eng	We don't have any cream.
5828720	eng	I was going out anyway.
5828741	eng	Does Sarah know about Jenny?
5828747	eng	I thought he'd be here.
5828757	eng	Jamal suffered quite a lot.
5828774	eng	He still isn't back yet.
5828780	eng	You can stay for dinner.
5828813	eng	Have you set the table?
5828815	eng	He can wait until tomorrow.
5828819	eng	I'm gonna tell Jamal tomorrow.
5828824	eng	Give it to me, Jamal.
5828827	eng	Come on and tell me.
5828829	eng	You could forget about dinner.
5829243	eng	I was mean to Tom.
5829246	eng	I did it by myself.
5829248	eng	I think I look old.
5829249	eng	I was here at 2:30.
5829384	eng	She tried to stay calm.
5829416	eng	You're bothering this poor boy!
5829434	eng	The weather is quite lovely.
5829436	eng	It's so cold in here.
5829438	eng	It's so hot in here.
5829449	eng	I am learning Old English.
5829469	eng	Is that your native accent?
5829477	eng	This isn't my real accent.
5829479	eng	This isn't my native accent.
5829511	eng	You added an extra parenthesis.
5829516	eng	We must digitize these books.
5830208	eng	I used to hate exercising.
5830231	eng	I'll try and do something.
5830238	eng	Tom gives us good advice.
5830239	eng	I'm even more excited now.
5830772	eng	Mary lashed out at Tom.
5830774	eng	I wonder who will win.
5830776	eng	I'm taking some summer classes.
5830778	eng	I'm not a total idiot.
5831497	eng	There, there, child, don't cry.
5831527	eng	My last hope is gone.
5831531	eng	You shouldn't say such things.
5831705	eng	And what if you disappoint?
5831735	eng	Anne hurried home after breakfast.
5831773	eng	She's a very religious woman.
5831790	eng	His wife is very pretty.
5831858	eng	I'm very upset about that.
5831894	eng	I got up at sunrise.
5831904	eng	You've been crying, haven't you?
5831985	eng	You've been working too much.
5831987	eng	Tom and I sat together.
5831993	eng	Tom must've been very unhappy.
5832525	eng	Do you want more money?
5832535	eng	What happened won't happen again.
5832552	eng	We're here to see you.
5832554	eng	Jamal is a terrible romantic.
5832557	eng	Jamal left me a note.
5832561	eng	Is there a problem, Jamal?
5832578	eng	Take a seat over there.
5832582	eng	Nothing in life is easy.
5832585	eng	You have to start learning.
5832593	eng	Tom sang and Mary danced.
5832594	eng	I don't think they're safe.
5832597	eng	She's serious about her work.
5832598	eng	What is the problem, Jamal?
5832603	eng	Tom wanted to go fishing.
5832622	eng	I guess I'm just romantic.
5832633	eng	Love is just a fancy.
5832637	eng	Just give me a price.
5832640	eng	Is she a patient here?
5832653	eng	And what do you want?
5832662	eng	You mean it doesn't matter?
5832665	eng	Don't you see that, Jamal?
5832671	eng	I'm here waiting for her.
5832673	eng	I don't want his flowers.
5832676	eng	I don't wanna see him.
5832677	eng	We spent yesterday morning together.
5832704	eng	His fate is already decided.
5832718	eng	Put that on my desk.
5832721	eng	You must be working hard.
5832743	eng	Let's tell him what happened.
5832746	eng	Is that what she said?
5832748	eng	He's just tired of waiting.
5832759	eng	Give it to me, Tom.
5832763	eng	Tom arrived in a taxi.
5832764	eng	Are you married to Tom?
5832766	eng	Give me your hand, Tom.
5832769	eng	Don't you see that, Tom?
5832771	eng	Tom suffered quite a lot.
5832772	eng	Tom is naive and gullible.
5832775	eng	Why isn't Tom coming tonight?
5832789	eng	You know what this is?
5832793	eng	I bought him a watch.
5832795	eng	You're no a child anymore.
5832802	eng	These flowers can't stay here.
5832804	eng	"Here you go." "Thank you."
5832812	eng	I don't care. I'll pay.
5832813	eng	Do we have the money?
5832830	eng	Well that moment has come.
5832832	eng	You weren't at school yesterday.
5832834	eng	I thought he wasn't coming.
5832837	eng	I love it. It's perfect.
5832842	eng	He wasn't always like that.
5832845	eng	Decorating isn't really my thing.
5832857	eng	You can take my car.
5832859	eng	Here. This is for you.
5832863	eng	News really does travel fast.
5832864	eng	I'd like to know something.
5832964	eng	Thanks for the coffee, sweetheart.
5832972	eng	What on earth happened here?
5833173	eng	Tom was an auto mechanic.
5833176	eng	How difficult can that be?
5833189	eng	Guess who Tom's father is?
5833193	eng	Tom is accustomed to traveling.
5833815	eng	Anne tossed her red braids.
5834125	eng	The winter weeks slipped by.
5834441	eng	Prior preparation prevents poor performance.
5834472	eng	I quite frankly don't know.
5834487	eng	How do you stay motivated?
5834488	eng	Tom is already making progress.
5834492	eng	Tom and Mary are divorced.
5834513	eng	How has your life changed?
5834520	eng	Tom cut the envelope open.
5834528	eng	Tom died in the collision.
5834538	eng	I'll be in Boston tomorrow.
5834630	eng	Tom doesn't try very hard.
5834631	eng	I'm hoping it won't happen.
5834634	eng	Tom is doing surprisingly well.
5834638	eng	Tom got his feelings hurt.
5834646	eng	Tom had fun playing cards.
5834649	eng	How many guards are there?
5834654	eng	Tom has never been absent.
5834655	eng	I didn't care what happened.
5834694	eng	Tom is interested in golf.
5834702	eng	Tom knew he couldn't stay.
5834703	eng	I don't think I've mellowed.
5834710	eng	Tom might be coming later.
5834718	eng	Tom never locks his doors.
5834729	eng	How realistic is the plan?
5834790	eng	The ice cream was delicious.
5834812	eng	How tolerant should we be?
5834835	eng	How would you handle this?
5834848	eng	Men can't understand these things.
5834868	eng	Tom started talking to me.
5834904	eng	Tom isn't a university student.
5834910	eng	Tom wants things done now.
5834919	eng	I didn't want anybody's help.
5834999	eng	I'll miss Tom a lot.
5835658	eng	How can you criticize that?
5835663	eng	Tom wished he were taller.
5835766	eng	You never had a father.
5835776	eng	Are you talking from experience?
5835778	eng	To live is to fight.
5835794	eng	They took advantage of it.
5835814	eng	Come on, don't look sad.
5835823	eng	I've probably got an ulcer.
5835827	eng	He must be extremely worried.
5835834	eng	What if they heard you?
5835835	eng	You could really get hurt.
5835841	eng	So why are you here?
5835842	eng	Did she let you in?
5835850	eng	My truck has been stolen.
5835869	eng	I don't trust men anymore.
5835873	eng	I didn't get badly hurt.
5835885	eng	Let's not do this here.
5835891	eng	I promise you'll regret this.
5835892	eng	Could you stop causing trouble?
5835894	eng	I've earned it without you.
5835911	eng	Why did Fadil come here?
5835918	eng	Call her whatever you want.
5835933	eng	I know you stole it.
5835936	eng	I'll give you a check.
5835938	eng	Why did Tom come here?
5835943	eng	"Your name is...?" "Fadil Sadiq."
5835952	eng	I wanna be with you.
5835974	eng	You've got to tell me.
5835981	eng	I feel fine now, really.
5835991	eng	You didn't bring flowers today.
5835996	eng	You're not wrong about that.
5836014	eng	I promise we'll have fun.
5836017	eng	I'm really busy right now.
5836028	eng	Stay away from me, Fadil.
5836030	eng	I'm absolutely and completely serious.
5836060	eng	Is he feeling any better?
5836061	eng	That's all I'm asking for.
5836071	eng	The baby is still fine.
5836073	eng	We've just admitted a patient.
5836090	eng	It looks good to me.
5836106	eng	My life was a mess.
5836108	eng	Now I don't understand anything.
5836141	eng	Maybe they had a fight.
5836148	eng	Stay away from me, Tom.
5836159	eng	Fadil is on his way.
5836196	eng	Isn't that your brother's truck?
5836199	eng	I didn't steal the money.
5836227	eng	Did you talk to Fadil?
5836234	eng	I made these for you.
5836237	eng	Go back to your house.
5836242	eng	What is Fadil waiting for?
5836246	eng	Guess where I'm calling from.
5836252	eng	I must talk to Fadil.
5836256	eng	Fadil is taking a shower.
5836267	eng	He believed in my skills.
5836279	eng	He still has some hope.
5836289	eng	It doesn't matter. Not anymore.
5836294	eng	You must have seen him.
5836297	eng	Does Fadıl know Jet Fadıl?
5836301	eng	Get out of my office!
5836309	eng	You have to understand that.
5836325	eng	I must talk to Tom.
5836326	eng	This one is for Tom.
5836335	eng	Tom wanted to see him.
5836337	eng	Tom wanted to see her.
5836355	eng	Everything's the same as before.
5836403	eng	I never regretted doing that.
5836405	eng	How exactly does this work?
5836571	eng	Mary is a quack doctor.
5836803	eng	Tawny owls are highly territorial.
5837534	eng	How much caffeine is fatal?
5837887	eng	I bought Tom a watch.
5837888	eng	Is that what Tom said?
5837889	eng	Why is Tom always late?
5837894	eng	I thought Tom wasn't coming.
5837899	eng	Let's tell Tom what happened.
5838182	eng	"You've been crying," remarked Josie.
5838184	eng	Anne worked hard and steadily.
5838279	eng	I thought Tom was studying.
5838287	eng	I thought Tom was swimming.
5838295	eng	Tom bought me a dictionary.
5838296	eng	I wouldn't trust anyone else.
5838304	eng	I wouldn't trust anyone here.
5838306	eng	How much will college cost?
5838327	eng	Tom handled that very well.
5838349	eng	Tom needs something to eat.
5838351	eng	Tom needs something to do.
5838552	eng	Fadil had Layla strip naked.

5838655	eng	You will never catch me.
5838658	eng	Fadil went back to prison.
5838664	eng	This really wasn't his lifestyle.
5838674	eng	Fadil didn't get very far.
5838677	eng	Fadil didn't have family there.
5838681	eng	Fadil was reincarcerated for that.

5851103	eng	I won't sing with you.
5851110	eng	I won't give you that.
5851117	eng	I was just going home.
5851120	eng	We didn't have any warning.
5851127	eng	We didn't change the rules.
5851131	eng	I tried to be evasive.
5851132	eng	Doing that would've been ridiculous.
5851134	eng	We couldn't go any further.
5851145	eng	I think I was amusing.
5851148	eng	We can't give you anything.
5851155	eng	This won't fix the problem.
5851158	eng	I won't answer that question.
5851159	eng	I seldom go to church.
5851197	eng	These are half price today.
5851200	eng	I'm fairly talented, I think.
5851204	eng	That's part of the problem.
5851208	eng	I hardly ever do that.
5851211	eng	Pets can be very expensive.
5851222	eng	I don't have a butler.
5851228	eng	I'm not interested in sports.
5851232	eng	Mary makes her own clothes.
5851235	eng	I'm not leaving anytime soon.
5851236	eng	I didn't wait in line.
5851239	eng	Mary is wearing high heels.
5851243	eng	I can't do that today.
5851246	eng	Mary is tall and beautiful.
5851249	eng	I'm pretty excited right now.
5851250	eng	I can't back down now.
5851253	eng	Mary is knitting a sweater.
5851256	eng	I'm pretty outgoing, I think.
5851257	eng	I can run really fast.
5851264	eng	I can already do that.
5851271	eng	I came here by myself.
5851278	eng	I believe I was wrong.
5851284	eng	I've learned from my mistake.
5851285	eng	I believe I was right.
5851291	eng	I've seen this movie already.
5851313	eng	I'm proud of my work.
5851316	eng	It feels weird not working.
5851319	eng	I can't communicate with them.
5851326	eng	I'm going to save it.
5851329	eng	Hot dogs are three dollars.
5851332	eng	I deeply regret that decision.
5851336	eng	Don't let anybody fool you.
5851339	eng	I didn't go jogging yesterday.
5851354	eng	I'll let you do that.
5851364	eng	You must be really hungry.
5851375	eng	I wish I were famous.
5851382	eng	I went out by myself.
5851403	eng	I was on TV recently.
5851406	eng	We've fixed all the leaks.
5851413	eng	We waited a little longer.
5851417	eng	I tried to look busy.
5851424	eng	I tried to keep warm.
5851431	eng	I thought I was done.
5851434	eng	We might do that tomorrow.
5851439	eng	Perhaps I'm sometimes too secretive.
5851453	eng	I seldom eat at home.
5851460	eng	I refused to do that.
5851467	eng	I need some rest now.
5851474	eng	I may need your help.
5851481	eng	I like to tell jokes.
5851498	eng	They wouldn't let me sing.
5851512	eng	They didn't want me there.
5851519	eng	That's not worth the risk.
5851526	eng	That's not worth our time.
5851530	eng	I cut my hair myself.
5851537	eng	I can't tell you why.
5851554	eng	That never occurred to me.
5851561	eng	Please don't make me sing.
5851575	eng	Mary's dress is too short.
5851586	eng	I'm not a good cook.
5851589	eng	Mary is prettier than you.
5851596	eng	Mary is a wonderful woman.
5851603	eng	Let's not eat out tonight.
5851610	eng	Let's not do this anymore.
5851624	eng	It's difficult to do that.
5851626	eng	Tom says he understood everything.
5851634	eng	I know you're being sarcastic.
5851638	eng	It's been cloudy all week.
5851642	eng	I tried to stand up.
5851645	eng	It wasn't really so scary.
5851655	eng	I seldom wear a hat.
5851658	eng	It was a great experience.
5851665	eng	Go back home to Australia.
5851676	eng	I often read in bed.
5851679	eng	Did you change the filter?
5851682	eng	I seldom visit Boston anymore.
5851686	eng	All the children like you.
5851693	eng	You're half an hour late.
5851697	eng	I might not do that.
5851700	eng	You won't mind, will you?
5851704	eng	I may still do that.
5851707	eng	You must be really tired.
5851719	eng	I sat on a log.
5851720	eng	Who said I wouldn't help?
5851724	eng	I have news for you.
5851741	eng	We've been working on it.
5851747	eng	I put on a tie.
5851752	eng	I can run very fast.
5851769	eng	They don't want to leave.
5851797	eng	Mary's dress is too long.
5851804	eng	Mary is wearing a brooch.
5851811	eng	Mary is knitting a scarf.
5851825	eng	Mary is a charming woman.
5851829	eng	I'm in a big hurry.
5851839	eng	Let's not go there today.
5851846	eng	Last night was very cold.
5851862	eng	I understood everything Tom said.
5851871	eng	I should be in bed.
5851888	eng	Did you sing by yourself?
5851906	eng	I often wear a hat.
5851920	eng	I never wear a tie.
5851927	eng	I never wear a hat.
5851948	eng	I hope I'll fit in.
5851969	eng	I don't have a son.
5851974	eng	Tom is better-looking than John.
5851986	eng	What do our guests want?
5851993	eng	We're taking a big risk.
5852014	eng	We often talk about you.
5852038	eng	I'm a big boy now.
5852052	eng	I was my own boss.
5852069	eng	Nobody knows what to do.
5852087	eng	I need a new coat.
5852090	eng	Mary is a capable nurse.
5852104	eng	It was a great surprise.
5852121	eng	I think I'm pretty generous.
5852125	eng	French is easy to learn.
5852135	eng	I've been drinking since 2:30.
5852139	eng	Don't be afraid to sing.
5852141	eng	Tom thinks he knows everything.
5852146	eng	Do you think I'm biased?
5852170	eng	I've tried doing that already.
5852171	eng	I have a fast car.
5852174	eng	Aren't we going do that?
5852178	eng	I can't do it all.
5852184	eng	I almost never have nightmares.
5852190	eng	Tom didn't give an explanation.
5852197	eng	That's probably what Tom meant.
5852230	eng	Who's going to do what?
5852258	eng	When should we do that?
5852267	eng	I didn't answer Tom's question.
5852314	eng	What did the doctor do?
5852335	eng	We might as well leave.
5852337	eng	Tom must be expecting company.
5852349	eng	Was I supposed to sing?
5852363	eng	They might not do that.
5852365	eng	Perhaps Tom has fallen asleep.
5852374	eng	I was in a fight.
5852405	eng	Let me help you choose.
5852413	eng	What are Tom's children like?
5852425	eng	It wasn't an easy race.
5852434	eng	Tom must be somewhere around.
5852439	eng	It sure is windy today.
5852446	eng	How do you really feel?
5852460	eng	Go put some clothes on.
5852467	eng	Doors open at 2:30 p.m.
5852471	eng	I sat on the bed.
5852485	eng	I sat at the bar.
5852488	eng	Can you jump that high?
5852492	eng	I said it was OK.
5852504	eng	Tom said I looked beautiful.
5852509	eng	Be prepared to do that.
5852520	eng	I put on my coat.
5852523	eng	Will you be my friend?
5852539	eng	Tom teaches law at Harvard.
5852544	eng	We do this every year.
5852546	eng	Tom said I sounded worried.
5852553	eng	Tom said I looked stunning.
5852560	eng	Tom said I looked horrible.
5852567	eng	Tom said I looked confused.

5852602	eng	Tom said I seemed shocked.
5852609	eng	Tom said I seemed puzzled.
5852614	eng	How deep is this pool?
5852616	eng	Tom said I seemed nervous.
5852623	eng	Tom said I seemed excited.
5852624	eng	I went downtown this afternoon.

5852637	eng	Tom said I looked unhappy.
5852644	eng	Tom said I looked stunned.
5852649	eng	We might not do that.
5852651	eng	Tom said I looked shocked.
5852653	eng	I hit a home run.
5852656	eng	They may not be home.
5852658	eng	Tom said I looked serious.
5852665	eng	Tom said I looked relaxed.
5852672	eng	Tom said I looked puzzled.
5852679	eng	Tom said I looked pleased.
5852686	eng	Tom said I looked healthy.
5852693	eng	Tom said I looked furious.
5852698	eng	It's easy to do that.
5852700	eng	Tom said I looked annoyed.
5852706	eng	It sure is hot today.
5852710	eng	I have a new job.
5852715	eng	Tom has many friends here.
5852717	eng	I have a new car.
5852720	eng	Can we talk with you?

5852731	eng	I have a hot tub.
5852736	eng	I'm one of Tom's brothers.
5852737	eng	I've already washed the dishes.
5852738	eng	I have a fake ID.
5852745	eng	I had a good job.
5852748	eng	Why did you stab me?
5852764	eng	His name isn't really Tom.
5852766	eng	I got up at 6:30.
5852771	eng	Even Tom didn't know that.
5852773	eng	I got on the bus.
5852780	eng	I got in the car.
5852785	eng	Tom says I'm very stingy.
5852787	eng	I got in the cab.
5852793	eng	I always worry about everything.
5852806	eng	Tom said I looked scared.
5852813	eng	Tom said I looked pretty.
5852820	eng	Tom said I looked hungry.
5852825	eng	Sorry, I was a jerk.
5852834	eng	Tom did that really well.
5852841	eng	Tom did that all himself.
5852846	eng	My wife is a lawyer.
5852848	eng	Tom badly needs our help.
5852855	eng	I'm one of Tom's sisters.
5852874	eng	It was a great idea.
5852876	eng	I think I frightened Tom.
5852890	eng	You can't depend on Tom.
5852897	eng	Tom says I'm too skinny.
5852918	eng	Tom said I looked tired.

5852974	eng	Tom said I looked pale.
5852981	eng	Tom is nicer than Mary.
5852988	eng	Tom has improved a lot.
5852994	eng	Tom did it all himself.
5853016	eng	I should've been more assertive.
5853036	eng	Tom said I looked old.
5853043	eng	Tom might not do that.
5853050	eng	Tom asked us to leave.
5853057	eng	I'm very close to Tom.
5853064	eng	I left after Tom left.
5853086	eng	I wasn't in yesterday afternoon.
5853098	eng	I helped Tom do that.
5853105	eng	Tom was in an agony.
5853134	eng	I'm already thirty minutes late.
5853147	eng	How do I look, Tom?
5853161	eng	I'm thirty minutes late already.
5853230	eng	I got mad at Tom.
5853237	eng	I gave Tom a job.
5853273	eng	I hope you've enjoyed yourselves.
5853274	eng	I was in a coma.
5853379	eng	This game is really boring.

5856487	eng	Mary made a friendship bracelet.
5856488	eng	I made you a bracelet.

6248388	eng	I didn't accept Tom's invitation.
6248446	eng	Everyone listened to Tom's story.
6248587	eng	What'll Tom do tomorrow morning?
6248671	eng	Perhaps Tom doesn't read novels.
6248810	eng	Tom returned from Australia yesterday.
6248917	eng	I thought Tom wasn't interested.
6248926	eng	I thought Tom seemed unfriendly.
6249036	eng	You really should've visited Boston.
6249153	eng	Yesterday was my thirtieth birthday.
6249198	eng	Who's your favorite baseball player?
6249342	eng	Tom has very easy-to-read handwriting.
6249352	eng	That's an entirely different matter.
6249379	eng	Nobody wants to take responsibility.
6249389	eng	I didn't recognize Tom's sister.
6249638	eng	You'd defend Tom, wouldn't you?
6249731	eng	Those sunglasses belong to Tom.
6249742	eng	I thought we'd outsmarted everybody.
6249758	eng	Perhaps Tom will come tomorrow.
6249793	eng	I should've done things differently.
6249830	eng	I've looked for Tom everywhere.
6249880	eng	I'm positive Tom speaks French.

6250554	eng	Tom substituted margarine for butter.
6250575	eng	Tom still isn't completely convinced.
6250603	eng	You've studied French, haven't you?
6250610	eng	Even Tom can understand French.
6250701	eng	"Who's that man?" "That's Tom."
6250838	eng	You apparently should've done that.

6251099	eng	It's quite possible that'll happen.
6251100	eng	I think Tom is self-conscious.
6251133	eng	I should've apologized to Tom.
6251165	eng	It was raining yesterday afternoon.
6251179	eng	Tom often complains about mosquitoes.

6252642	eng	Tom will probably become frustrated.
6252652	eng	We never should've visited Boston.
6252688	eng	This morning's meeting was boring.
6252697	eng	This is a non-profit organization.
6252766	eng	My approach is somewhat different.
6252787	eng	Mary isn't wearing lipstick today.
6252805	eng	Many people have been complaining.

6252885	eng	Tom should've gotten here yesterday.
6252891	eng	Tom should've chosen something else.
6252894	eng	Tom should've been more cooperative.
6252937	eng	I've filled out the questionnaire.
6253018	eng	I'm convinced that that'll happen.
6253149	eng	Tom said he's cautiously optimistic.
6253252	eng	I should've driven more carefully.
6253261	eng	I should've chosen something else.
6253264	eng	I should've apologized right away.
6253354	eng	Tom received a thirty-year sentence.

6254256	eng	You're a billionaire, aren't you?
6254336	eng	Tom forged his boss's signature.
6254406	eng	You could've done that yesterday.
6254475	eng	Who doesn't do that occasionally?
6254493	eng	What's Australia most famous for?
6254508	eng	What are some possible solutions?
6254520	eng	We're prohibited from doing that.
6254535	eng	We should've done that yesterday.
6254565	eng	We can't ignore these complaints.
6254580	eng	This morning's meeting was short.

6255173	eng	Tom usually buys expensive clothes.
6255176	eng	Tom understands French fairly well.
6255278	eng	Tom suggested we leave immediately.

6255333	eng	I know that you're uncomfortable.
6255380	eng	Tom shouldn't have gotten involved.
6255383	eng	Tom should've understood the rules.
6255384	eng	I heard children playing outside.
6255479	eng	I don't really understand French.
6255779	eng	I didn't complain about anything.

6256214	eng	You did that exceptionally well.
6256220	eng	You could've done that yourself.
6256346	eng	What's your French teacher like?
6256349	eng	What's that building over there?

6267488	eng	It's important to do that.
6267491	eng	It's humid here in Boston.
6267494	eng	It's foggy here in Boston.
6267497	eng	It's dangerous to do that.
6267499	eng	Tom should've been a teacher.
6267500	eng	It's almost time to leave.
6267502	eng	Tom should wait until Monday.
6267527	eng	I've only done that twice.

6267632	eng	I'm capable of doing that.
6267644	eng	I'll invite you next time.
6267647	eng	I'll do that after dinner.
6267653	eng	I'd rather do that myself.
6267658	eng	Tom said I looked ridiculous.
6267661	eng	Tom said I looked bewildered.
6267662	eng	I'd be nervous doing that.
6267665	eng	I wouldn't do that either.
6267667	eng	Tom remarried his first wife.

6267779	eng	I thought Mary was pretty.

6267811	eng	Tom left his umbrella behind.
6267812	eng	I shouldn't do that today.
6267815	eng	I shouldn't do that again.
6267818	eng	I shouldn't be here today.

6267842	eng	I should do that tomorrow.
6267845	eng	I should do that sometime.

6349957	eng	Most likely Tom won't win.
6349960	eng	Most likely Tom won't cry.
6349961	eng	You'd better leave early today.

6350057	eng	Why haven't you eaten anything?
6350064	eng	Tom almost never smiles anymore.
6350074	eng	I think Tom was terrified.
6350088	eng	Tom will probably win tomorrow.
6350099	eng	What difference does that make?
6350104	eng	I studied French with Tom.
6350108	eng	We've decided to sing together.

6355599	eng	Tom seemed to be asleep.
6355601	eng	This gravy is too salty.
6355602	eng	Tom seemed to be amused.
6355604	eng	This chair is well made.
6355607	eng	This building is a bank.
6355610	eng	The noise kept me awake.
6355619	eng	That isn't yours, is it?
6355622	eng	That hat doesn't fit me.

7113635	eng	What more can you want?
7113639	eng	What do you care about?
7113643	eng	We'd better run for it.

7113700	eng	I hesitated to do that.
7113703	eng	Why is Tom so misunderstood?
7113706	eng	I got into a fistfight.
7113708	eng	I felt good about that.

7786371	eng	There's no reason not to.
7786377	eng	Tom is not exactly reliable.
7786382	eng	We see her on occasion.
7786452	eng	That was a dumb decision.
7786453	eng	That was a stupid decision.
7786523	eng	Can you guess his age?
7787219	eng	But the coffee isn't tasty.
7787234	eng	She did everything for her.
7787300	eng	You seem busy right now.
7787355	eng	Tom tested positive for steroids.
7787369	eng	Please come back to Boston.
7787370	eng	Tom is back in bed.
7787375	eng	That was a good compromise.
7787380	eng	I'm meeting Tom's parents tonight.
7787721	eng	What is an endurance test?
7787723	eng	I don't know her age.
7787724	eng	I don't know his age.
7787741	eng	Who invented the safety pin?
7787944	eng	You're washing laundry for me.
7787945	eng	You're doing laundry for me.
7788240	eng	We can't hide here anymore.
7788246	eng	What causes a panic attack?
7788261	eng	I hate doing the laundry.
7788586	eng	This event has touched me.

7790485	eng	Tom is in my group.
7790517	eng	Just admit that you're wrong.
7790745	eng	You should go play outside.
7790845	eng	Fighting is not a solution.

7791791	eng	I have some Canadian friends.
7791829	eng	We'll visit Tom next week.
7791844	eng	We might've underestimated Tom's ability.
7791863	eng	We've started to recycle newspapers.
7791958	eng	We failed to persuade Tom.
7792010	eng	This tool is completely useless.
7792025	eng	I suggest you study it.
7792043	eng	I don't write many letters.

7793737	eng	Doing that wasn't an option.
7793738	eng	Tom and Mary are incorrect.
7793766	eng	I've been to the station.

7793800	eng	We assume that it's natural.
7793802	eng	You'd better change your clothes.
7793803	eng	You should change your clothes.
7793808	eng	Tom has overstayed his welcome.
7794219	eng	I don't support that theory.

7912597	eng	What flower do you see?
7912664	eng	I willingly fulfilled his wish.
7912669	eng	Fear not, telling the truth.
7912927	eng	She wants to drink champagne.
7912937	eng	It's impossible to trust him.
7912971	eng	He doesn't have any money.

7915432	eng	Ultra-processed foods make people fat.
7915473	eng	Tom got his eyes checked.
7915490	eng	The truth is more complex.
7915493	eng	I don't mean to brag.
7915509	eng	This calls for a celebration.
7915523	eng	Tom did a little dance.
7915524	eng	Tom did a victory lap.
7915576	eng	That isn't an orange tree.
7916171	eng	Tom's mum is very strict.

7919660	eng	The fire refused to burn.
7919667	eng	Nobody dared whisper a word.
7919690	eng	Tom really rubbed it in.
7919778	eng	A certain humility is needed.
7919783	eng	These two brothers are twins.
7919784	eng	Hell's gate is open already?
7919993	eng	I am unwilling to negotiate.
7920155	eng	We have a test today.

7923999	eng	Tom wearily closed his eyes.
7924001	eng	Is Chinese your native language?

8855788	eng	Time's going by slowly today.
8855801	eng	They have finally given in.
8855802	eng	At last they gave in.
8855804	eng	Meanwhile a rethink has begun.
8855827	eng	That was a hot day.
8855830	eng	That can't happen straight away.
8855839	eng	That was weird, wasn't it?
8855845	eng	All eyes turned to her.
8855857	eng	Everything has already been said.
8855862	eng	Does the film have subtitles?

8855876	eng	They won't refuse to listen.
8855890	eng	It won't stay like this.

8856265	eng	This is everything you have?
8856269	eng	He was very busy today.
8856276	eng	This isn't funny at all.
8856278	eng	Katia went home by bus.
8856297	eng	Only if it were true!
8856299	eng	I don't hear a noise.
8856301	eng	You are giving me less.
8856355	eng	Are you still over there?
8856549	eng	Who's looking after your children?
8856734	eng	This makes me feel sad.
8856786	eng	I want to see you!
8856789	eng	People will always be unsatisfied.
8856790	eng	Obviously we are all different.
8856794	eng	This speech is very good.
8856795	eng	This presentation is really good.
8856796	eng	The school gave us textbooks.
8856808	eng	Notice what she is saying.
8856809	eng	I will be happy forever!
8856810	eng	This hat suits you well.

8858006	eng	You are just a toy.
8858012	eng	Should we make a bet?
8858033	eng	I'm asking just in case.
8858071	eng	The tree is very high.
8858073	eng	We arrived at seven o'clock.
8858076	eng	You will drive to London.

8858079	eng	We can pass without him.
8858086	eng	He was following her tracks.
8858087	eng	Miss, you forgot your change!
8858092	eng	Children don't like to shower.
8858097	eng	She is returning from England.

8858613	eng	What car do you drive?
8858999	eng	English gardens are very beautiful.
8859037	eng	Will you be leaving tomorrow?
8859061	eng	The first lesson was easy.

8859165	eng	Did you bring the hairdryer?
8859166	eng	Have you brought the hairdryer?
8859179	eng	She has declined the invitation.
8859180	eng	He picked up a pencil.
8859201	eng	The engine works pretty well.
8859352	eng	Don't confuse me for yourself.
8859353	eng	The police are your friends.
8859584	eng	He has only one leg.

8860152	eng	Tom went home by bus.
8860176	eng	Thank you for allowing me.
8860231	eng	What time do you arrive?
8860243	eng	She is smarter than him.
8860247	eng	He rejected even the cereal.
8860248	eng	This tie fits your shirt.
8860257	eng	I have never doubted that.
8860265	eng	What does "dog life" mean?
8860268	eng	Do you have 5 cents?

8861170	eng	Lately you just talk nonsense.
8861325	eng	I want to learn Greek.
8861359	eng	Did you catch a cold?
8861383	eng	Tom is crazy about music.
8861561	eng	I should've been more supportive.
8861876	eng	You'd probably enjoy doing that.
8861906	eng	I want orange cotton pants.
8861916	eng	He can change his opinion.
8861917	eng	She can change her opinion.
8861918	eng	Are they the same breed?
8861928	eng	I was suspecting something similar.
8861946	eng	I'll take two of everything.
8861949	eng	And what did you see?
8861951	eng	We had already decided, right?
8861966	eng	I'm too lazy to travel.
8861976	eng	She is his complete opposite.
8861981	eng	We're not accustomed to waiting.
8862089	eng	I've decided to study medicine.
8862374	eng	You need to practice more.
8862497	eng	I can't find the lighter.
8862673	eng	It's just started to snow.
8862803	eng	What'll we have to do?
8862818	eng	No one is without fault.
8862874	eng	What'll I have to do?
8862964	eng	I didn't hear a sound.
8862974	eng	Do you ever call them?
8862975	eng	Do you ever call him?
8862976	eng	Do you ever call her?
8863043	eng	This is a little dirty.
8863162	eng	We need to talk, Tom.
8863182	eng	The cat warms my feet.
8863211	eng	We each paid five thousand.
8863216	eng	Would you like a bag?
8863273	eng	We saw the twins yesterday.
8863280	eng	Now this is something else!
8863286	eng	You could've said a hi.
8863302	eng	I'm on it right away!
8863328	eng	I've been arrested several times.
8863331	eng	You never make your bed.
8863362	eng	You don't have a kitten?
8863368	eng	How about a little coffee?
8863370	eng	I don't understand the reason.
8863374	eng	There are people at school.
8863403	eng	I'm aware of such things.
8863601	eng	You are driving to London.
8863603	eng	"Enjoy your meal!" "You too!"
8863606	eng	Is it a new kind?
8863615	eng	He always eats breakfast alone.
8863623	eng	We can pass without this.
8863625	eng	We can pass without her.
8863638	eng	It's important that you answer.
8863646	eng	Send it to my e-mail.
8863655	eng	My grandmother doesn't drink water.
8863658	eng	Can I use your cellphone?
8863660	eng	They don't like this book.
8863668	eng	I would prefer the second.
8863753	eng	I found that somewhat embarrassing.
8863980	eng	Windows is a widely-used tracker.
8863982	eng	Google is an enormous tracker.
8863999	eng	I’m dying of back pain.
8864105	eng	I fixed something to eat.
8864133	eng	The symbol "&" means "and".
8864246	eng	I'll pay Tom tomorrow afternoon.
8864348	eng	I've never ridden Tom's horse.
8864359	eng	He has very thin lips.
8864362	eng	Laziness is what drives progress.
8864368	eng	Sorry for my bad behaviour.
8864383	eng	It's important to keep training.
8864387	eng	Send it to my email.
8864699	eng	Tom clamped his mouth shut.
8864811	eng	I think that it's strange.
8864821	eng	I lent Tom some books.
8864876	eng	I was arrested and handcuffed.
8864877	eng	My kidnappers were never arrested.
8865024	eng	It's fun to play cards.
8865051	eng	She is constantly getting lost.
8865088	eng	Running into you was inevitable.
8865093	eng	I got off my horse.
8865117	eng	I like my coffee black.
8865169	eng	Do you know this one?
8865181	eng	Do you love learning French?
8865215	eng	You need to trust me.
8865277	eng	I knew this was wrong.
8865301	eng	I know this area well.
8865319	eng	That I know for certain.
8865330	eng	That's a very bad habit.
8865413	eng	The kittens are getting big.
8865744	eng	Nobody knew it was there.
8865760	eng	We don't know the reason.
8865817	eng	I’m not going to stir.
8865864	eng	There's an end to everything.
8865938	eng	Do they need to finish?
8865964	eng	He will never hang up!
8865965	eng	Oh! I know that guy.
8865968	eng	Is it comfortable like this?
8865986	eng	Should we go out tonight?
8865990	eng	His daughter is very cute.
8866018	eng	Please come to this register.
8866028	eng	Thank you, this is all.
8866064	eng	It cannot stay like this.
8866093	eng	He finally slept with her.
8866096	eng	She finally slept with him.
8866122	eng	She was considering leaving him.
8866534	eng	Nobody knew why this happened.
8866563	eng	Nobody knows why this happens.
8866566	eng	I needed the money desperately.
8866594	eng	Tom looks down on everybody.
8866631	eng	A hat graced her head.
8866634	eng	Her bag was very light.
8866636	eng	The situation is very complex.
8866641	eng	The candles were shining brightly.
8866653	eng	He's switched the telly on.
8866654	eng	He switched on the telly.
8866655	eng	He's switched the television on.
8866656	eng	He switched on the television.
8866662	eng	They've taken a day off.
8866663	eng	They took a day off.
8866664	eng	You've taken a day off.
8866665	eng	She's taken a day off.
8866666	eng	She took a day off.
8866670	eng	An oppressive silence suddenly descended.
8866679	eng	Tom switched the TV on.
8866710	eng	You counted on your brother.
8866728	eng	I've never spoken with Tom.
8866760	eng	I showed Tom my paintings.
8866796	eng	Give me, I'll do it!
8866798	eng	I handed Tom the document.
8866810	eng	The warranty is two months.
8866818	eng	Cuba is in Central America.
8866853	eng	Did you know Tom's mother?
8866871	eng	Tom and I have separated.
8866900	eng	I helped Tom get dressed.
8866929	eng	I've brought Tom a gift.
8867037	eng	Many of you know Tom.
8867047	eng	I told Tom the story.
8867054	eng	I thought Tom did it.
8867061	eng	You don't agree with me?
8867092	eng	I sold Tom a T-shirt.
8867098	eng	I showed Tom a video.
8867121	eng	I offered Tom a ride.
8867178	eng	I met Tom in college.
8867217	eng	I mailed Tom a check.
8867308	eng	I gave Tom some cash.
8867315	eng	Tell Tom I'll be late.
8867329	eng	Mary's out of Tom's league.
8867345	eng	I gave Tom my number.
8867365	eng	I gave Tom a warning.
8867411	eng	I wrote Tom a check.
8867442	eng	I went to visit Tom.
8867478	eng	I wanted to hit Tom.
8867501	eng	I want to scare Tom.
8867615	eng	I saw Tom at church.
8867768	eng	I ran away from Tom.
8867827	eng	I needed to see Tom.
8868000	eng	I gave Tom a cookie.
8868029	eng	I didn't sit by Tom.
8868033	eng	The year went by quickly.
8868098	eng	I used to date Tom.
8868114	eng	I stood up for Tom.
8868158	eng	I sent Tom a video.
8868232	eng	There's no reasoning with them.
8868250	eng	I paid Tom in cash.
8868415	eng	I gave Tom a shirt.
8868462	eng	I got Tom a taxi.
8868478	eng	Shitposting is not a revolution.
8868533	eng	I don't come here often.
8868550	eng	I don't cook very often.
8868566	eng	Let's end this unpleasant conversation.
8868634	eng	I won't cut any corners.
8868681	eng	I won't pay you anything.
8868708	eng	I've met your kind before.
8868764	eng	Tom didn't have an accomplice.
8869292	eng	Necessity even emboldens the timid.
8869337	eng	Necessity even hardens the timid.
8869457	eng	He's like his twin brother.
8869467	eng	Is there a smaller size?
8869476	eng	She does very sharp turns.
8869479	eng	He couldn't find a job.
8869482	eng	I hadn't perforated my ticket.
8869509	eng	There's too much traffic here.
8869887	eng	We didn't treat Tom well.
8870044	eng	I don't think Tom snores.
8870187	eng	Nobody has managed to survive.
8870278	eng	Why didn't I get anything?
8870313	eng	The socks are on sale.
8870327	eng	Eight plus ten makes eighteen.
8870337	eng	It rained the entire trip.
8870937	eng	My old friend is sick.
8871069	eng	I know nothing about witchcraft.
8871131	eng	She asked you to search.
8871328	eng	Some sheep crossed the road.
8871452	eng	Yankev is an observant Jew.
8871453	eng	Esther is an observant Jew.
8871731	eng	I'm not good for you.
8871757	eng	Do we have any ketchup?
8871758	eng	Is there any ketchup left?
8871773	eng	I saw Tom in church.
8871833	eng	He wrote the book himself.
8871880	eng	I knew how Tom felt.
8871890	eng	I took that from Tom.
8871894	eng	I tried to shoot Tom.
8871900	eng	I wanted to hire Tom.
8871904	eng	I wanted to tell Tom.
8871915	eng	I was alone with Tom.
8871917	eng	I was upset with Tom.
8871921	eng	I went to Tom's room.
8871925	eng	I'll do this for Tom.
8871926	eng	I will overthrow the dictator.
8871929	eng	I bought Tom some balloons.
8871958	eng	I was referring to Tom.
8871966	eng	I was walking with Tom.
8872006	eng	We know Tom is dangerous.
8872013	eng	Oh! It was already there.
8872026	eng	I want Tom's opinion, too.
8872067	eng	He takes it upon himself.
8872076	eng	He couldn't find Mary's house.
8872092	eng	Don't scrimp on your health.
8872195	eng	What do you all think?
8872201	eng	Did you all enjoy yourselves?
8872289	eng	I know why that happened.
8872311	eng	Why doesn't anyone say anything?
8872345	eng	I hope he'll help us.
8872351	eng	No one could get in.
8872355	eng	Nobody ever tells me anything.
8872404	eng	How do you get there?
8872525	eng	I don't know these women.
8872526	eng	I don't know these ladies.
8872531	eng	But don't get me wrong.
8872555	eng	It's difficult to do this.
8872720	eng	I gave Tom two cookies.
8872813	eng	Some people even got violent.
8872829	eng	Some people got really angry.
8872842	eng	Will the situation get worse?
8872861	eng	I gave Tom a bow.
8872915	eng	We couldn't get there quickly.
8873025	eng	Tom is a house nigger.
8873157	eng	It's not enough for argumentation.
8873454	eng	No one could get out.
8873456	eng	How long do cats live?
8873467	eng	How long do dogs live?
8873490	eng	He illegally crossed the border.
8873494	eng	I didn't read the rest.
8873497	eng	I don't like small dogs.
8873622	eng	She soon found fresh hope.
8873624	eng	She soon found hope again.
8873629	eng	He repeated her words parrot-fashion.
8873668	eng	You don't eat enough vegetables.
8873669	eng	You eat too few vegetables.
8873671	eng	Last night wasn't very warm.
8873673	eng	Haven't you got a telly?
8873674	eng	Haven't you got a television?
8873675	eng	Don't you have a telly?
8873676	eng	Don't you have a television?
8873679	eng	My husband is a Luxembourger.
8873680	eng	My wife is a Luxembourger.
8873710	eng	Tom dismounted from his bicycle.
8873761	eng	Don't you have a TV?
8873798	eng	I was warned about you.
8873939	eng	The trolleybus arrived on time.
8874091	eng	I always sleep till eight.
8874288	eng	I can't forget those eyes.
8875185	eng	Let's go and play football.
8875319	eng	Tom has a small house.
8875321	eng	Tom gave me a shirt.
8875326	eng	Tom doesn't speak my language.
8875579	eng	I think it's too big.
8875757	eng	I will pick Tom up.
8876067	eng	You cannot prepare for that.
8876095	eng	Tom asked us to come.
8876296	eng	I didn't let Tom talk.
8876389	eng	I gave Tom more money.
8876553	eng	I gave Tom some water.
8876938	eng	Tom wants to go there.
8877018	eng	How old is the dog?
8877022	eng	Tell me where I failed.
8877028	eng	Reason differentiates man from animals.
8877034	eng	The people demand social justice.
8877040	eng	The nation demands social justice.
8877041	eng	I had a wonderful dream.
8877058	eng	Tom is fixing your bicycle.
8877061	eng	The painting was really touching.
8877067	eng	They are dead and buried.
8877488	eng	Tom wants to go rowing.
8877570	eng	I came home last Monday.
8877645	eng	I met Tom earlier today.
8877686	eng	Tom and I've lost touch.
8877771	eng	I gave Tom three cookies.
8877782	eng	I gave Tom three options.
8877843	eng	I'm afraid Tom might come.
8877866	eng	It'll probably rain after lunch.
8877912	eng	Tom's hair has grown back.
8877927	eng	War has already broken out.
8877929	eng	She cannot deal with stress.
8877930	eng	He cannot cope with stress.
8877992	eng	Tom started to get violent.
8877998	eng	It's really hot outside today.
8878026	eng	I'll answer only one question.
8878030	eng	Tom wrote the book himself.
8878138	eng	I anticipate that will happen.
8878204	eng	Would you fancy a cup?
8878233	eng	I think that he's wrong.
8878396	eng	People strive towards various goals.
8878531	eng	Last night wasn't very cold.
8878601	eng	You must be more aggressive.
8878633	eng	What do you actually think?
8878702	eng	Tom declared he was innocent.
8878740	eng	Tom flunked his driving test.
8878871	eng	I agree with that decision.
8878956	eng	It's terribly hot in here.
8879001	eng	It might rain after lunch.
8879044	eng	I tried climbing the tree.
8879259	eng	What was wrong with that?
8879261	eng	Tom seized on the opportunity.
8879291	eng	Our team isn't very good.
8879298	eng	It was an excellent plan.
8879331	eng	I turned down Tom's invitation.
8879373	eng	Do you see anything else?
8879418	eng	It's been warm all week.
8879422	eng	Tom has graduated from college.
8879487	eng	Virginity is lost in intercourse.
8879496	eng	Who's eaten all the cheese?
8879537	eng	I had a little fever.
8879560	eng	Why don't we try it?
8879583	eng	That was an exemplary performance!
8879722	eng	Tom illegally crossed the border.
8879781	eng	It was a nice plan.
8879894	eng	I agree to do that.
8879920	eng	You mustn't put on weight.
8880287	eng	You get dreams for free.
8880288	eng	We get dreams for free.
8880339	eng	This seems a bit off.
8880375	eng	She's going to work alone.
8880378	eng	I was at my best.
8880428	eng	I did it without thinking.
8880445	eng	Syncretism is my religious inclination.
8880573	eng	Put it in this box.
8880608	eng	My son can't talk yet.
8880629	eng	He slowly opened his eyes.
8880870	eng	I didn't need any help.
8880957	eng	Would you care for tea?
8881022	eng	How did they do it?
8881044	eng	That box is already full.
8881192	eng	We were walking and talking.
8881377	eng	What happened next was surprising.
8881659	eng	I couldn't recall their names.
8881977	eng	He copied all the data.
8881985	eng	That man stole my handbag.
8881991	eng	Esperanto is 125 years old.
8882005	eng	You're not a trustworthy person.
8882305	eng	I said what I thought.
8882322	eng	I'm going to the market.
8882329	eng	It was very hot today.
8882486	eng	Tom exposed himself in public.
8882544	eng	They're thinking about something else.
8882554	eng	Is this woman a promoter?
8882567	eng	He doesn't agree, does he?
8882987	eng	I expected that from Tom.
8883046	eng	Tom is still not married.
8883556	eng	We each paid thirty dollars.
8883620	eng	The explanation was very complicated.
8883796	eng	"Where are our cousins?" "Australia."
8883826	eng	It's going to become cold.
8883827	eng	It's going to turn cold.
8883834	eng	We'll have breakfast at eight.
8883839	eng	Dad, these pineapples are sour!
8883843	eng	He's fallen into the water.
8883844	eng	He fell into the water.
8883859	eng	I've made a mushroom omelette.
8883861	eng	Who'd like an ice cream?
8883863	eng	Who wants an ice cream?
8883864	eng	Who wants some ice cream?
8883866	eng	Does anyone want ice cream?
8883908	eng	Did you take the receipt?
8883909	eng	Have you taken the receipt?
8883911	eng	You pay at the checkout.
8883912	eng	You pay at the till.
8883925	eng	This further complicates the problem.
8883933	eng	The autumn moon is beautiful.
8883961	eng	Our working environment was good.
8883967	eng	Please give him my regards.
8883969	eng	Not a soul is here.
8883972	eng	My bag has had it.
8884249	eng	Tom raised an eyebrow quizzically.
8884345	eng	I bought Tom a hat.
8884375	eng	I'm playing a video game.
8884443	eng	I expected something like that.
8884472	eng	There are always other offers.
8884493	eng	Tom never takes a train.
8884512	eng	The meeting is next Thursday.
8884517	eng	Pay for whatever you want.
8884554	eng	Foma is my younger brother.
8884620	eng	Suddenly I felt very tired.
8884700	eng	My phone is still charging.
8884783	eng	He snores loudly while sleeping.
8884825	eng	I only asked one question.
8884847	eng	Our grandmother has many dogs.
8884891	eng	My student had a cat.
8884921	eng	I slowly opened my eyes.
8884935	eng	Do you still believe him?
8884994	eng	How is your grandfather doing?
8885174	eng	Tom comes from old money.
8885178	eng	This is the real McCoy.
8885281	eng	We climbed up the hill.
8885326	eng	Suffering is not a virtue.
8885345	eng	My girlfriend doesn't like flowers.
8885397	eng	It will soon be spring.
8885422	eng	I expected a job offer.
8885425	eng	There are no flowers here.
8885758	eng	He is tired of work.
8885807	eng	This is not his phone.
8885809	eng	This really is a masterpiece.
8885832	eng	We were bombarded with questions.
8885907	eng	I'm thinking about what happened.
8885973	eng	Tom is feeding the dog.
8886040	eng	I accidentally dropped my phone.
8886041	eng	I accompanied Tom to Boston.
8886087	eng	I'm beginning to miss Boston.
8886094	eng	I bought something for dinner.
8886164	eng	I handed Tom a shovel.
8886326	eng	I've done a good job.
8886346	eng	Tom's cousin lives in Australia.
8886347	eng	Tom's aunt lives in Australia.
8886425	eng	The prisoners must be released.
8886434	eng	We use only natural materials.
8886444	eng	This lie troubles my conscience.
8886448	eng	Doubt weighs on my soul.
8886451	eng	Don't ask me about anything.
8886455	eng	Tom is burdened by loneliness.
8886489	eng	The snow hasn't melted yet.
8886491	eng	The snow hasn't thawed yet.
8886605	eng	I'm learning how to swim.
8886606	eng	What size does he wear?
8886646	eng	I drank a few beers.
8886675	eng	You've just taken a shower.
8886696	eng	Enter one by one, please.
8886750	eng	Stand in a straight line.
8886754	eng	Johano looked at a cow.
8886794	eng	When did the accident occur?
8886798	eng	Well, will that happen soon?
8886800	eng	A girl has a fever.
8886812	eng	I will eat your bananas.
8886866	eng	I pried off the lid.
8886896	eng	I pried the lid off.
8886902	eng	Every bird has its song.
8886943	eng	I'm waiting for your message.
8886944	eng	I'm waiting for your text.
8886959	eng	You must fulfil your tasks.
8886960	eng	Tom is a bad eater.
8887003	eng	I ran to the garage.
8887066	eng	I sat near the door.
8887216	eng	What is this game called?
8887298	eng	I never had a choice.
8887388	eng	I ran into the woods.
8887450	eng	We need to know that.
8887517	eng	I cracked open a beer.
8887589	eng	I hid behind the door.
8887686	eng	I left my car running.
8887744	eng	I pried the door open.
8887758	eng	I flipped on the light.
8887770	eng	I had a lovely evening.
8887775	eng	I have my own computer.
8887785	eng	I have tons of friends.
8887835	eng	I kicked the door open.
8887860	eng	I left the blinds open.
8887867	eng	Tom has lost his sight.
8887868	eng	Tom only speaks one language.
8887934	eng	I opened the back door.
8887979	eng	I'm one of the leaders.
8888083	eng	I crouched on all fours.
8888113	eng	That's not what was agreed.
8888116	eng	The last stretch was brutal.
8888117	eng	The last section was brutal.
8888123	eng	Maybe you should drink less.
8888131	eng	She's an exceptionally good student.
8888147	eng	The shelf was mounted badly.
8888155	eng	No one's making a sound.
8888160	eng	The coach gives them instructions.
8888165	eng	The manager gives them instructions.
8888168	eng	The season's over for him.
8888170	eng	He says he was fouled.
8888180	eng	He has been sent off.
8888187	eng	The defender has fouled him.
8888195	eng	He'll miss the whole season.
8888208	eng	He looked like a mummy.
8888220	eng	She has injured her hand.
8888222	eng	He has sprained his ankle.
8888223	eng	She has injured her shoulder.
8888227	eng	Have you brought your flask?
8888228	eng	Did you bring your flask?
8888229	eng	The holidays are coming up.
8888248	eng	Could you get this translated?
8888268	eng	I heard a buzzing noise.
8888337	eng	I pried the window open.
8888367	eng	The day after tomorrow's Sunday.
8888370	eng	The day after tomorrow's Tuesday.
8888398	eng	I'm not a greedy person.
8888469	eng	Bad faith is so despicable!
8888541	eng	I couldn't find my phone.
8888561	eng	It did not rain yesterday.
8888589	eng	I don't have enough food.
8888670	eng	I left the curtains open.
8888838	eng	I never went there again.
8888932	eng	I opened the garage door.
8888939	eng	Everything will soon be decided.
8888969	eng	That is an older letter.
8889004	eng	Despite his attempts, nothing worked.
8889064	eng	I drove across the bridge.
8889083	eng	I knew nothing about that.
8889151	eng	What did your dog eat?
8889160	eng	My dog is a poodle.
8889166	eng	I always wake up early.
8889167	eng	I leaned against the tree.
8889172	eng	I finally got Tom's attention.
8889193	eng	We have a black dog.
8889307	eng	I've never been a gambler.
8889407	eng	I wasn't talking about myself.
8889409	eng	I was talking about myself.
8889416	eng	I've never slept in class.
8889444	eng	She broke my favorite guitar.
8889478	eng	I couldn't prove my theory.
8889531	eng	I crouched behind the bush.
8889584	eng	I listened carefully to Tom.
8889598	eng	I'm going to Rome, Italy.
8889628	eng	I saw Tom throw something.
8889914	eng	I heard something behind me.
8889920	eng	I don't visit Tom anymore.
8889992	eng	I heard the doorknob jiggle.
8889993	eng	I picked Tom up downtown.
8890011	eng	I headed back to Boston.
8890018	eng	Tom is a creepy person.
8890028	eng	Let's go inside the shelter.
8890030	eng	I helped Tom get ready.
8890249	eng	We here don't like outsiders.
8890283	eng	I crouched beneath the window.
8890313	eng	I didn't recognize that woman.
8890664	eng	I don't mind coming early.
8890676	eng	I'll go pick Tom up.
8890694	eng	Come to Boston with us.
8890769	eng	I asked only one question.
8891032	eng	Luckily, I found my keys.
8891526	eng	Today's definitely not my day.
8891527	eng	I asked for more details.
8891741	eng	That's how I learned English.
8891775	eng	I think I'll watch TV.
8891962	eng	Shut up! Go eat shit!
8891988	eng	I want to restore justice.
8892037	eng	I wrote Tom a card.
8892131	eng	I asked Tom to wait.
8892280	eng	Tom is a mama's boy.
8892551	eng	I believe what Tom said.
8892767	eng	I asked Tom that question.
8892935	eng	I asked Tom many questions.
8892941	eng	The meeting is next Monday.
8892954	eng	Our cat is very high-strung.
8893037	eng	Are we laying the table?
8893039	eng	Shall we lay the table?
8893042	eng	All you need is time.
8893044	eng	Let her say her piece.
8893045	eng	Let her have her say.
8893046	eng	Let them have their say.
8893049	eng	Tom will be next door.
8893057	eng	Is the ice cream nice?
8893075	eng	Careful! The pavement is slippery.
8893087	eng	Has anyone asked you anything?
8893089	eng	Did anyone ask you anything?
8893098	eng	Isn't there any bread left?
8893099	eng	Is there no bread left?
8893102	eng	The water penetrated the walls.
8893119	eng	Are they all like that?
8893232	eng	Nestor is eating chicken adobo.
8893514	eng	Our face isn't perfectly symmetrical.
8893600	eng	No face is perfectly symmetrical.
8893621	eng	No face has perfect symmetry.
8893785	eng	Take a shovel to it.
8893972	eng	This relationship just doesn't work.
8893981	eng	I have rewritten the sentence.
8893987	eng	I am considering leaving her.
8893992	eng	All she does is complain.
8893998	eng	You must decide for yourself.
8894055	eng	We are all friends here.
8894590	eng	Salmon are a keystone species.
8894600	eng	Most salmon die after spawning.
8895445	eng	Tommy ordered tea and buns.
8895448	eng	Tommy sat down opposite her.
8895456	eng	The tea came at last.
8895507	eng	Shall we really try it?
8895513	eng	The employee followed the procedure.
8895517	eng	It confused me at first.
8895523	eng	I myself didn't do that.
8895527	eng	How long do spiders live?
8895528	eng	Tom left the meeting early.
8895533	eng	And what is Plan B?
8895539	eng	Tom likes his foster mother.
8895545	eng	I don't remember the incident.
8895546	eng	Tom often suffered from headaches.
8895557	eng	I don't work overtime anymore.
8895590	eng	I entered the cave cautiously.
8895626	eng	Porridge tastes best with milk.
8895824	eng	Who helped you do that?
8895928	eng	Is he coming with me?
8895999	eng	Have you sent the book?
8896125	eng	I won't check your work.
8896180	eng	That is certainly a mistake.
8896203	eng	Did you follow me here?
8896251	eng	You don't have to stop.
8896263	eng	The workers didn't have helmets.
8896325	eng	Did you send the book?
8896347	eng	The workers don't have helmets.
8896692	eng	You are eating your chocolate.
8896705	eng	Try it with a hammer.
8896739	eng	I like stories about vampires.
8896885	eng	I'm a very introverted person.
8896960	eng	I'm leaving that for tomorrow.
8897024	eng	The lesson finishes at noon.
8897040	eng	Yo! Hurry up! Come on!
8897080	eng	The ambulance arrived right away.
8897178	eng	Tom wants to do this.
8897186	eng	Tom wants to eat now.
8897190	eng	They don't want to change.
8897195	eng	Tom wants to go alone.
8897203	eng	The world needs to change.
8897226	eng	Tom wants to cook today.
8897240	eng	We've encountered some unexpected obstacles.
8897245	eng	Tom wants that right now.
8897248	eng	Tom wants to be included.
8897314	eng	Tom wanted to be included.
8897535	eng	Tom wanted to get involved.
8897766	eng	Many people didn't like Tom.
8897812	eng	People say Tom is brilliant.
8897916	eng	They gave him a gun.
8897929	eng	Does it only avoid confrontation?
8897994	eng	What nationality are your teachers?
8898006	eng	It's a very popular game.
8898031	eng	Diogenes was the first punk.
8898135	eng	What's your cell phone number?
8898280	eng	I caught only three fish.
8898332	eng	Tom didn't like his teachers.
8898433	eng	Isn't my best friend Lebanese?
8898446	eng	He's taking care of it.
8898449	eng	Do they have Mexican passport?
8898456	eng	Tom was taking a shower.
8898465	eng	My best friend was Pakistani?
8898470	eng	Maybe he has got it.
8898496	eng	I'm still laughing out loud!
8898642	eng	I understand you quite well.
8898643	eng	I never visited South Africa.
8898657	eng	Don't you like the coffee?
8898748	eng	I work at a salon.
8898963	eng	There are security cameras everywhere.
8899414	eng	I've never been to America.
8899502	eng	Companies say advertising is helpful.
8899918	eng	I've just finished the report.
8900475	eng	How come you don't know?
8900497	eng	What's he doing to her?
8900520	eng	What's 'thank you' in Berber?
8900618	eng	The computer might not work.
8900761	eng	I will need her help.
8900771	eng	I still did not run.
8900803	eng	You used to stand up.
8900805	eng	My parents really liked you.
8900807	eng	Here we go changing again!
8900810	eng	Thanks for your help guys!
8900818	eng	Any insult leads to death.
8900955	eng	Foma is my older brother.
8901430	eng	Thanks to everyone who's here!
8901459	eng	He might take long steps.
8901601	eng	This bag is very heavy.
8901606	eng	Have you used my camera?
8901628	eng	There's enough food for everybody.
8901880	eng	I see Tom every weekend.
8901896	eng	It's an old Visigoth text.
8901904	eng	The next day passed slowly.
8901965	eng	There's enough food for everyone.
8901974	eng	Some people find me intimidating.
8902001	eng	Slaves were treated like animals.
8902214	eng	Tom is counting the days.
8902218	eng	I inherited my father's property.
8902288	eng	Let's just leave him alone!
8902290	eng	Peter is inside the house.
8902293	eng	These are our dining halls!

9133793	eng	It's time to eat something.
9133801	eng	Could I have a coffee?
9133806	eng	Put your back into it!

9166268	eng	This game is very old.
9166280	eng	How many foreigners work here?
9166377	eng	Dad, buy me a vuvuzela.
9166387	eng	I ran out of cheese.

9166612	eng	I don't like falling behind.
9166686	eng	They haven't told Tom yet.
9166855	eng	You eat rice, don't you?
9167068	eng	I just can't stand it.
9167085	eng	You should rewrite this report.
9167088	eng	Tom nodded and stood up.
9167089	eng	This is a bit boring.
9167126	eng	Tom didn't hear the shot.

9167342	eng	They have confirmed your order.
9167378	eng	My favorite vegetable is eggplant.
9167436	eng	A new update is available.
9167478	eng	Your order has been delayed.

9167578	eng	Put it wherever you want.
9167614	eng	For now, we're doing well.
9167622	eng	I wait for her here.
9167625	eng	Mary tried to kiss me.
9167629	eng	The sea is still calm.
9167650	eng	Dad had lost his mind.
9167722	eng	Can we work something out?
9167723	eng	Can't we work something out?

9169246	eng	I like feeling like this.
9169248	eng	I like feeling like that.
9169255	eng	How much is that cheese?

9169531	eng	I'm going to lose weight.
9169731	eng	Aren't we going to Greece?
9169753	eng	Someone brought it to him.
9169772	eng	I couldn't watch him suffer.
9169862	eng	I don't want to anymore.
9169869	eng	I don't need to anymore.
9169903	eng	It says it wasn't there.
9170186	eng	He has big blue eyes.
9170463	eng	May the devil take me!
9170815	eng	She opened the door quietly.
9170817	eng	Tom opened the door quietly.

9171073	eng	See how late it is.
9171097	eng	I received your communiqué today.
9171190	eng	I can't go over it.
9171221	eng	Maybe Tom will say something.
9171233	eng	Tom turned his lights off.
9171243	eng	Here's where I get off.
9171276	eng	You people can't stay here.
9171281	eng	Mary is a loving mother.
9171282	eng	Tell Tom to come in.
9171284	eng	Get used to it, kid.
9171287	eng	Tom's laundry day is Monday.
9171335	eng	That noise kept me awake.
9171356	eng	Not many people know this.
9171363	eng	Tom began to get upset.
9171377	eng	Tom looked at Mary disapprovingly.
9171383	eng	This is so unlike Tom.
9171395	eng	Can we go crazy now?
9171399	eng	They're probably all dead now.
9171403	eng	The doctor pronounced Tom dead.
9171404	eng	Would anyone like more coffee?
9171410	eng	What's your favorite Halloween movie?
9171416	eng	This sentence is commonly used.
9171422	eng	There's no cell service here.
9171434	eng	We'll send Tom a letter.
9171435	eng	Yes, you can use it.
9171443	eng	Any RPGs that you're into?
9171444	eng	I can't even describe it.
9171507	eng	I'm going to buy tickets.
9171538	eng	Tom was my best student.
9171599	eng	Tom has his eyes closed.
9171615	eng	Will you come with Tom?
9171726	eng	I couldn't live without television.
9171739	eng	I can't miss the meeting.
9171742	eng	Tom could be a communist.
9171744	eng	I can hear you two.
9171747	eng	Tom's house is far away.
9171760	eng	Tom might not accept it.
9171761	eng	I really like this picture.
9171786	eng	Tom took a hot shower.
9171852	eng	Tom went to the gate.
9172014	eng	Tom sits next to me.
9172260	eng	You can do it, girl.
9172336	eng	Tom came a little late.
9172681	eng	I ate half the cake.
9172892	eng	Please stay for some tea.
9172925	eng	Tom might do it today.
9172968	eng	The guards will shoot Tom.
9173321	eng	He never read Tom's novel.
9173713	eng	Do you believe in Santa?
9176120	eng	You dragged me into this.
9176138	eng	Tom might not be worried.
9176164	eng	Tom quickly lit a fire.
9176201	eng	You should take a shower.
9176204	eng	Tom will probably believe you.
9176211	eng	I remember reading this novel.
9176219	eng	I promise I'll be back.
9176222	eng	I've never seen Tom here.
9176240	eng	Tom hung the towel up.
9176250	eng	Tom hung up the towel.
9176253	eng	You aren't better than me.
9176338	eng	This is a shallow pond.
9176365	eng	She will not help us.
9176394	eng	You should write to Tom.
9176410	eng	I've already written to him.
9176412	eng	I've already written to her.
9176414	eng	I've already written to them.
9176423	eng	Only one light was on.
9176440	eng	I've already written to everyone.
9176441	eng	What if Tom sees us?
9176442	eng	Have you written to everyone?
9176448	eng	I've called everyone I know.
9176489	eng	Does Tom really love me?
9176507	eng	Tom's smug behavior is offensive.
9176514	eng	I cut my own hair.
9176526	eng	Be careful. Don't cut yourself.
9176531	eng	Is it good or bad?
9176532	eng	Why don't we stop Tom?
9176572	eng	I won't apologize to Tom.
9176584	eng	What games does she like?
9176591	eng	This question often comes up.
9176594	eng	I bet I'll see them.
9176595	eng	We'll overcome this crisis together.
9176604	eng	She always treated me well.
9176605	eng	My fog lights are on.
9176608	eng	I'll sit on the couch.
9176611	eng	In all likelihood, I'll win.
9176615	eng	Stop throwing that at me.
9176617	eng	Boys only, no girls allowed.
9176618	eng	Girls only, no boys allowed.
9176623	eng	Tom was more than upset.
9176625	eng	Our team has no girls.
9176660	eng	This fish doesn't taste good.
9176692	eng	No doubt you'll like this.
9176695	eng	This is called a plate.
9176701	eng	I've been single for years.
9176704	eng	I'm visiting Athens this summer.
9176711	eng	I can see you're happy.
9176725	eng	Look at those snow-covered mountains.
9176743	eng	I really liked your outfit.
9176745	eng	That outfit suited you nicely.
9176746	eng	It'll depend on the context.
9176747	eng	I haven't heard it before.
9176753	eng	That's not how it's said.
9176756	eng	He mixed sugar and milk.
9176763	eng	For here or to go?
9176782	eng	Guess who Tom bet on?
9176783	eng	She's good at the piano.
9176788	eng	She came back by train.
9176794	eng	My job is solving problems.
9176819	eng	I'm going with my friends.
9176822	eng	What's the jacket made of?
9176840	eng	The snow is already melting.
9176848	eng	It's a very big store.
9176854	eng	The question is very simple.
9176856	eng	Summer will be over soon.
9176864	eng	I have other plans today.
9176890	eng	I like to eat burgers.
9176893	eng	Tom wants something to drink.
9176977	eng	It looks like you're happy.
9176986	eng	When will Tom be arriving?
9176993	eng	Tom died without any heirs.
9176997	eng	How big is your office?
9176998	eng	I paid and then left.
9177058	eng	Tom still doesn't understand it.
9177083	eng	Why did you deceive Tom?
9177097	eng	I'm a train without tracks.
9177109	eng	Is that a JoJo reference?
9177112	eng	Why isn't Tom at work?
9177126	eng	You eat fruit, don't you?
9177156	eng	I was on my own.
9177161	eng	Will Tom stay or leave?
9177198	eng	What's in store for us?
9177208	eng	Tom took it from us.
9177211	eng	I bought you a car.
9177225	eng	Yanni spoke English very well.
9177246	eng	What's Tom been accused of?
9177253	eng	Tom can count to ten.
9177256	eng	Next month is Tom's birthday.
9177295	eng	You should take a look.
9177332	eng	Yanni was riding the bus.
9177334	eng	Yanni rode the bus home.
9177338	eng	I forgot what it's called.
9177389	eng	I'm looking for a partner.
9177576	eng	I probably won't go today.
9177600	eng	You have to work tomorrow.
9177700	eng	Junk food afflicts your health.
9177997	eng	Tom didn't answer my call.
9178030	eng	Is the computer plugged in?
9178043	eng	Is Tom eating a sandwich?
9178054	eng	Tom might not believe us.
9178090	eng	Tom doesn't like to fish.
9178097	eng	He's going to be happy.
9178107	eng	I already regret not going.
9178110	eng	Tom had a good upbringing.
9178129	eng	Do these gloves fit you?
9178140	eng	How long did Tom sleep?
9178207	eng	An ambulance took Tom away.
9178218	eng	Tom helped me do this.
9178247	eng	You can't stay here forever.
9178251	eng	She didn't lose any time.
9178385	eng	I'll check on that tomorrow.
9178429	eng	They left at what time?
9178457	eng	I'm watching a video now.
9178464	eng	I'm fed up watching television.
9178487	eng	Tom died during the war.
9178529	eng	I prefer not to answer.
9178530	eng	Where can I study Galician?
9178533	eng	Maybe Tom will forgive Mary.
9178547	eng	Gimme some of those chips.
9178551	eng	He's not a natural brunette.
9178583	eng	The skies display his handiwork.
9178605	eng	You were cold, weren't you?
9178607	eng	We won't forget your kindness.
9178615	eng	I tend to have nightmares.
9178741	eng	Tom fell from the horse.
9178888	eng	I spent all day cooking.
9178936	eng	When will Tom be home?
9178944	eng	I'll be using a shirt.
9178971	eng	Tom will be gone soon.
9179136	eng	Tom never called me back.
9179178	eng	I'm ashamed of my father.
9179353	eng	Does Tom come by often?
9179378	eng	Will Tom attend the meeting?
9179601	eng	Do you really like Tom?
9179696	eng	Because they hadn't seen it.
9179717	eng	Vehicle registrations have gone up.
9179719	eng	Several events have been suspended.
9179747	eng	It smells like burnt meat.
9179763	eng	Everything I do is fair.
9179766	eng	This much heat isn't normal.
9179767	eng	That's how I remember Tom.
9179772	eng	You're putting on some weight.
9179776	eng	This toilet has a flushometer.
9179804	eng	It's cold in the winter.
9179808	eng	This paint is really good.
9179817	eng	A princess doesn't wash herself.
9179821	eng	Hand me a clothes peg.
9179832	eng	They do whatever Tom wants.
9179842	eng	I want it really hot.
9179851	eng	Yes, I'm studying several languages.
9179907	eng	He was shaking and squirming.
9179909	eng	Tom doesn't like being tickled.
9179915	eng	Dresses were never her thing.
9179920	eng	What's your pen pal's name?
9179933	eng	Tell Tom where you'll be.
9179939	eng	How can I be informed?
9179940	eng	Is this a trustworthy source?
9179946	eng	Why are we so divided?
9179956	eng	Am I allowed to vote?
9179970	eng	Where can I learn more?
9179979	eng	Tamagoyaki is a Japanese-style omelet.
9179989	eng	How do you conjugate na-adjectives?
9180018	eng	I know it's Tom calling.
9180023	eng	Tom may not want it.
9180066	eng	The power just went out.
9180077	eng	You didn't do that right.
9180088	eng	I spent today working out.
9180089	eng	I spent today doing exercise.
9180104	eng	We had a nice day.
9180147	eng	Tom never came back here.
9180153	eng	I bought these books online.
9180154	eng	I bought this book online.
9180184	eng	I can't see the dog.
9180186	eng	You're stronger than I am.
9180189	eng	Your suit looks very expensive.
9180190	eng	Was that an expensive suit?
9180217	eng	The girl's name is Mary.
9180224	eng	I'll definitely go to Tom.
9180245	eng	My father never punished me.
9180247	eng	We lost by a lot.
9180256	eng	Tom may get married soon.
9180257	eng	This is our best option.
9180266	eng	It seems Tom was afraid.
9180276	eng	You're as short as me.
9180279	eng	You're as tall as me.
9180310	eng	That's a very tall tree.
9180316	eng	You don't seem too satisfied.
9180320	eng	You eat too much candy.
9180321	eng	Can I have that apple?
9180322	eng	Can I have these apples?
9180326	eng	My cat died last night.
9180339	eng	This is the wrong key.
9180369	eng	I got ripped off again.
9180420	eng	Everyone knows it was Tom.
9180541	eng	Tom went to a party.
9180571	eng	Go and keep Mary company.
9180575	eng	No one will do that.
9180583	eng	Tom needs to agree, too.
9180596	eng	Immerse yourself in the language.
9180603	eng	You aren't sure, are you?
9180613	eng	My car is a hybrid.
9180650	eng	I thought you needed help.
9180663	eng	I'm sure this isn't Tom's.
9180670	eng	I argued with my brothers.
9180671	eng	Don't you know Tom well?
9180752	eng	I won't change my plans.
9180777	eng	You've put on some weight.

9180903	eng	Did you drink it all?
9180905	eng	My dad doesn't drink anymore.
9180926	eng	I did this on purpose.
9180928	eng	There's someone in the house.
9180929	eng	There's somebody in the house.
9180932	eng	The police caught Tom red-handed.
9180933	eng	I wish Tom had left.
9180942	eng	There's nobody in the house.
9180983	eng	I have three more questions.
9180993	eng	Tom may not invite us.
9180999	eng	How do you tolerate Tom?
9181000	eng	When should I expect you?
9181001	eng	When can we expect you?
9181004	eng	When will you get here?
9181011	eng	You're still just a kid.
9181013	eng	This copy is for you.

9181400	eng	Tom pried the door open.
9181468	eng	I didn't hear his steps.
9181471	eng	Don't expect help from Tom.
9181472	eng	My French is really bad.
9181490	eng	I'm in the waiting room.
9181502	eng	You forgot the question mark.
9181508	eng	Don't eat the sea urchins.
9181516	eng	Both my parents have died.
9181520	eng	We care about the others.
9181549	eng	Tom got the best room.
9181587	eng	Is Tom older than me?
9181593	eng	I make the decisions here.
9181599	eng	Tom never argues with anybody.
9181626	eng	Tom will pick you up.
9181627	eng	I'll come here every year.
9181630	eng	Did Tom do this alone?
9181682	eng	Tom was among the guests.
9181693	eng	I'm going to invite Tom.
9181729	eng	Do you like to read?
9181734	eng	Russian is my mother tongue.
9181737	eng	Tom must be in love.
9181765	eng	You must not cross here.
9181794	eng	They need to come back.
9181802	eng	I'm tired of eating bananas.
9181806	eng	Is it up to you?
9181815	eng	His reputation is in tatters.
9181816	eng	Bonnie and Clyde robbed banks.
9181829	eng	Someone named Tom called you.
9181836	eng	This is indeed very efficient.
9181858	eng	She was born in Beijing.
9181862	eng	I prefer to talk afterwards.
9181917	eng	He is not feeling well.
9181923	eng	Maria was pale as death.
9181983	eng	That's my house over there.
9181991	eng	That could've been much worse.
9181992	eng	That could've gone much worse.
9182011	eng	Tom started to run again.
9182067	eng	I will see Tom tonight.
9182086	eng	I am stirring my coffee.
9182143	eng	Good day to you, sir.
9182197	eng	They performed a few concerts.
9182199	eng	You did that on purpose!
9182309	eng	I thought you were good.
9182334	eng	The river is shallow here.
9182407	eng	I don't share your beliefs.
9182468	eng	Tom should be a starter.
9182545	eng	Who did Tom call that?
9182590	eng	Jürgen Klopp's a soccer genius.
9182637	eng	I did a few sit-ups.
9182674	eng	Kobe Bryant was a legend.
9182700	eng	Hi to those over there.
9182897	eng	Can I pick my nose?
9182913	eng	I remember Tom very well.
9182933	eng	Mary is an old woman.
9182937	eng	I'll ask Tom about it.
9182999	eng	That story touched my heart.
9183000	eng	Russian is my native language.
9183039	eng	Watch how Tom does it.
9183074	eng	Maybe we shouldn't do this.
9183080	eng	Tom had a cerebral edema.
9183110	eng	Tom acted like a hero.
9183125	eng	This is a good computer.
9183183	eng	I have a new scooter.
9183196	eng	I won't work for free.
9183199	eng	I refuse to drink this.
9183201	eng	The results were unbelievably good.
9183202	eng	The results were very good.
9183203	eng	What did Tom get wrong?
9183207	eng	The refrigerator was completely empty.
9183224	eng	This needs to be rewritten.
9183228	eng	How old is Tom, anyway?
9183248	eng	I was left without money.
9183254	eng	I was up until midnight.
9183264	eng	Tom swerved to the left.
9183269	eng	I really like your outfit.
9183320	eng	Tom tried to scratch me.
9183352	eng	This park is always open.
9183353	eng	This library is always open.
9183365	eng	Did Tom have a weapon?
9183533	eng	I can't leave my husband.
9183553	eng	I got Tom's letter yesterday.
9183709	eng	Tom might have drunk it.
9183924	eng	Can Tom really do this?
9183995	eng	It froze over last night.
9184025	eng	Tom has gotten really fat.
9184069	eng	Many people would envy you.
9184079	eng	I'm not a dog lover.
9184088	eng	Tom and Mary got injured.
9184094	eng	“Yogurt” is a Turkish word.
9184138	eng	I need a French tutor.
9184217	eng	My secret ingredient is pumpkin.
9184359	eng	Ask Tom not to leave.
9184674	eng	I wanted to go left.
9184939	eng	Tom has sold his farm.
9185182	eng	Park next to my car.
9185241	eng	Maybe I'd better tell Tom.
9185281	eng	Mary's dress is bright red.
9185481	eng	You'd better ask Tom that.
9185538	eng	Tom was born to teach.
9186215	eng	Are your classes over yet?
9186329	eng	All Tom needs is rest.
9186798	eng	I have an older sister.
9186855	eng	They used to believe Tom.
9187332	eng	Please be nice to Tom.
9187678	eng	Tom might not believe you.
9187703	eng	This hat is too tight.
9187867	eng	I like to climb trees.
9187870	eng	Tom must've taken a taxi.
9187876	eng	What disadvantages does Tom have?
9187910	eng	We scratch where it itches.
9187918	eng	Without water, the flowers wilted.
9187930	eng	I hope that nobody minds.
9187955	eng	Tom ate all the candy.
9187967	eng	Tom didn't lock his door.
9187994	eng	We can't get near it.
9188072	eng	I mistook Tom for John.
9188082	eng	I need several of those.
9188127	eng	We shouldn't have left early.
9188131	eng	They asked Tom to resign.
9188134	eng	Tom eats in the kitchen.
9188147	eng	Today I didn't win anything.
9188251	eng	I spent all day studying.
9188259	eng	Try searching in the archives.
9188289	eng	Your suggestion is worth considering.
9188338	eng	How does this help Tom?
9188343	eng	Tom has tons of friends.
9188347	eng	Are you really OK, Tom?
9188358	eng	Tom and Mary married secretly.
9188391	eng	Tom must've taken the bus.
9188393	eng	Have you emailed Tom yet?
9188398	eng	I'll never say that again.
9188401	eng	Tom has a brain tumor.
9188403	eng	What books have you read?
9188404	eng	I consider Tom a hero.
9188430	eng	Have I been clear enough?
9188441	eng	Tom was never my student.
9188445	eng	What's Tom hiding from us?
9188446	eng	It's time to leave, Tom.
9188449	eng	That goes for Tom, too.
9188465	eng	Tom is allergic to dogs.
9188474	eng	When can I meet you?
9188488	eng	Go and keep Tom company.
9188490	eng	Tom doesn't listen to anybody.
9188501	eng	Tom has really bad breath.
9188517	eng	What nationality were your grandparents?
9188519	eng	Staying home isn't an option.
9188534	eng	I think that isn't mine.
9188539	eng	When will we have lunch?
9188542	eng	This plane is very big.
9188550	eng	My father isn't living anymore.
9188565	eng	I've been feeling stressed lately.
9188567	eng	We'll get through this somehow.
9188570	eng	We fasted for three days.
9188580	eng	What'll you do after work?
9188586	eng	I always wear my seatbelt.
9188601	eng	"What's this?" "It's a peach."
9188621	eng	I'm afraid it won't help.
9188623	eng	Tom hit me a lot.
9188629	eng	They gave Tom a nickname.
9188631	eng	You can have this pen.
9188633	eng	You can keep the pen.
9188651	eng	I gave acupressure a try.
9188654	eng	Stop throwing things at me.
9188656	eng	I'm sure you'll like this.
9188685	eng	I'm as good as you.
9188696	eng	I promise I'll be good.
9188698	eng	I promise I'll behave myself.
9188755	eng	I'm a kid at heart.
9188780	eng	Crime is on the rise.
9188826	eng	We saw men carrying guns.
9188874	eng	My wrists are very slim.
9188891	eng	Tom drank from my mug.
9188902	eng	I'm very ticklish; tickle me!
9188912	eng	I don't think he's arrived.
9188914	eng	When have you seen it?
9188916	eng	Maybe he's in the bathroom?
9188922	eng	Tom and Mary aren't well.
9188928	eng	I have to go, too.
9188933	eng	What did Tom promise you?
9188941	eng	Now the nights are cooler.
9188954	eng	The weather's really hot today.
9188966	eng	Where have you been to?
9188986	eng	Evil is but a shadow.
9189025	eng	He lived alone for years.
9189027	eng	Avoid those who avoid you.
9189041	eng	The people don't know it.
9189079	eng	I had to sell it.
9189085	eng	Imagine you have a wife.
9189093	eng	She doesn't play the piano.
9189117	eng	The earthquake shook the city.
9189133	eng	Someone didn't translate it correctly.
9189134	eng	Someone hasn't translated it correctly.
9189141	eng	I'll make sure it's repaired.
9189146	eng	We want to live peacefully.
9189152	eng	It's best that they resign.
9189159	eng	They shamelessly squander our money.
9189160	eng	They carelessly waste our money.
9189163	eng	Showering before entering is mandatory.
9189169	eng	Hello, how are you today?
9189172	eng	Hi, how are you today?
9189176	eng	Hello. How are you today?
9189215	eng	I barely avoided the cyclist.
9189233	eng	What is it, my dear?
9189245	eng	Tom tried to fool me.
9189250	eng	Has anything interesting happened lately?
9189251	eng	Has anything interesting happened recently?
9189299	eng	These two lines are divergent.
9189302	eng	Linguistic diversity must be protected.
9189305	eng	I've tried it several times.
9189309	eng	Last winter was really dry.
9189311	eng	It makes you feel better.
9189322	eng	It rains almost every day.
9189326	eng	Maybe I was too confident.
9189333	eng	Most politicians aren't good role-models.
9189334	eng	Most politicians aren't great people.
9189338	eng	Do governments lie to us?
9189339	eng	Are the official numbers credible?
9189350	eng	We still work with Tom.
9189353	eng	Telecommuting isn't the ultimate solution.
9189355	eng	It's best to stay home.
9189361	eng	I granted him a wish.
9189388	eng	These are made of leather.
9189391	eng	I want them without shoelaces.
9189392	eng	Those heels are really high.
9189393	eng	That one doesn't suit you.
9189438	eng	I think we'll eat fish.
9189531	eng	These socks were left out.
9189534	eng	These socks were left outside.
9189538	eng	Hold it with those clothespins.
9189539	eng	Hold it with those prongs.
9189546	eng	Hold it with those tongs.
9189570	eng	I'll wash the bedsheets separately.
9189591	eng	Why are your bedsheets wet?
9189692	eng	Don't take things for granted.
9189817	eng	Life is what it is.
9189826	eng	This is driving me nuts.
9189840	eng	Is Tom always that quiet?
9189904	eng	They messed up my picture.
9189932	eng	The convention was a disaster.
9189942	eng	I just talk to myself.
9189980	eng	Traffic has gone down considerably.
9189988	eng	There are insanely long lines.
9189997	eng	This winter hasn't been cold.
9190006	eng	You're crazier than I thought.
9190049	eng	What Tom said surprised Mary.
9190221	eng	Tom doesn't know much yet.
9190235	eng	I stocked up on food.
9190240	eng	Maybe Tom can do this.
9190282	eng	Tom had a hundred excuses.
9190287	eng	We came here with Tom.
9190306	eng	We have to go, guys.
9190307	eng	My father eats little fruit.
9190312	eng	Tom managed to do it.
9190329	eng	This child can speak English.
9190336	eng	Tom pretended not to hear.
9190424	eng	I gave Tom several comics.
9190477	eng	Tom has a screw loose.
9190549	eng	Tom said he wasn't stupid.
9190623	eng	Tom was a good person.
9190680	eng	I have no problem sleeping.
9190687	eng	Tom succumbed to the temptation.
9190781	eng	Listen to what Tom says.
9190788	eng	That is not a sentence.
9190827	eng	We won't be on time.
9190832	eng	I got Tom's phone number.
9190860	eng	How old is that boy?
9190939	eng	I think I'm doing better.
9190941	eng	We'll help Tom do it.
9190956	eng	Tom needs to come here.
9191000	eng	Is that the Big Dipper?
9191084	eng	I'm not saying you’re wrong.
9191604	eng	Tom says he's done it.
9191659	eng	Please hand me that pencil.
9191660	eng	Please hand me that pen.
9191738	eng	I've solved all the problems.
9191827	eng	Tom hasn't woken up yet.
9191866	eng	Tom may not have time.
9192019	eng	I had to use clamps.
9192092	eng	What we saw shocked us.
9192175	eng	I feel alone without Tom.
9192177	eng	That's a relief to hear.
9192194	eng	Was it a good party?
9192291	eng	Why did you call Tom?
9192354	eng	I bought myself a laptop.
9192375	eng	Tom rushed to his room.
9192420	eng	Maybe Tom needs a doctor.
9192434	eng	I heard a rooster crow.
9192441	eng	Tom lived in downtown Boston.
9192449	eng	Did anyone see Tom fall?
9192459	eng	Tom should've had a key.
9192462	eng	Have you two kissed yet?
9192463	eng	Does Tom know the truth?
9192467	eng	Can this sentence stand alone?
9192470	eng	Why did the plane crash?
9192493	eng	My mom packed our suitcases.
9192505	eng	Tom didn't even thank me.
9192522	eng	Go apologize to Tom now.
9192549	eng	I'm sorry I couldn't help.
9192555	eng	Tom may not believe you.
9192569	eng	I need both of those.
9192570	eng	I needed both of those.
9192571	eng	I'm going to Australia next.
9192576	eng	Tom was awarded a medal.
9192578	eng	I made inquiries about Tom.
9192586	eng	Kids shouldn't be in here.
9192587	eng	Children shouldn't be in here.
9192612	eng	Why's Tom wearing a mask?
9192614	eng	Tom left you a note.
9192621	eng	Tom might have eaten it.
9192623	eng	You know what we want.
9192626	eng	Give me back my eraser.
9192629	eng	Looks like you underestimated me.
9192631	eng	You can't handle my power.
9192634	eng	You call that an ultimatum?
9192639	eng	Is this the real you?
9192646	eng	You call that a bed?
9192651	eng	I had a nice day.
9192662	eng	Who bought Tom his violin?
9192667	eng	Why would Tom kiss Mary?
9192674	eng	Tom still hasn't got it.
9192681	eng	You're wasting your own time.
9192695	eng	We showed Tom this before.
9192709	eng	This is just a test.
9192722	eng	Everyone says that to you.
9192746	eng	This box isn't strong enough.
9192766	eng	You're a very talented writer.
9192769	eng	He likes going for walks.
9192770	eng	He likes to go walking.
9192824	eng	Bring us up to date.
9192830	eng	Today is my day off.
9192840	eng	Tom left on his bike.
9192841	eng	I like my almonds raw.
9192855	eng	The man killed the woman.
9192867	eng	I'm stuck in an elevator.
9192876	eng	Tom eats lunch at noon.
9192951	eng	He turned on the stove.
9192979	eng	Tom has already read it.
9192987	eng	I'll try to convince him.
9193014	eng	Tom was ready to cry.
9193057	eng	Go talk to Tom yourself.
9193059	eng	Who let the ants escape?
9193080	eng	My desk is a mess.
9193086	eng	I'm worried Tom won't come.
9193146	eng	Tom needs to come back.
9193148	eng	I'll go there again tomorrow.
9193151	eng	Maybe Tom will come back.
9193168	eng	I heard a door open.
9193207	eng	Today we are closing earlier.
9193277	eng	I never liked this photo.
9193285	eng	Will Tom change his mind?
9193308	eng	Tom doesn't drink hot tea.
9193311	eng	I handed him a beer.
9193312	eng	I see you're dressed up.
9193323	eng	That's not really true, though.
9193334	eng	Please show me this camera.
9193337	eng	They continued to meet regularly.
9193343	eng	Don't spoil our fun now!
9193350	eng	It's a very important thing.
9193377	eng	Tom doesn't like to swear.
9193394	eng	I got up very early.
9193408	eng	This movie made her popular.
9193411	eng	Don't let them get close.
9193431	eng	Tom will write a letter.
9193441	eng	Don't ever come here again!
9193454	eng	They're already annoyed at me.
9193457	eng	No reason could convince him.
9193478	eng	The opposition blames the government.
9193489	eng	This autumn's been rather strange.
9193493	eng	I barely had any money.
9193500	eng	The apple cake ran out.
9193501	eng	The apple cake's ran out.
9193504	eng	Think about what you're doing.
9193518	eng	I need a dozen eggs.
9193520	eng	I wanted to say sorry.
9193522	eng	Tom drives slower than me.
9193536	eng	Tom went to visit Mary.
9193561	eng	I'll buy something to eat.
9193615	eng	The room was very dirty.
9193686	eng	Tom simply can't do that.
9193688	eng	Did he touch your butt?
9193696	eng	You can still help Tom.
9193883	eng	Everybody knows it was Tom.
9193990	eng	My brother was drinking juice.
9194009	eng	Tom may do this again.
9194026	eng	What did Tom buy you?
9194089	eng	Tom reaped what he sowed.
9194108	eng	I've lost my mailbox key.
9194117	eng	That might be a lie.
9194164	eng	Tom might be leaving soon.
9194184	eng	Tom looked at us blankly.
9194185	eng	I've already ironed my dress.
9194224	eng	You should call Tom tomorrow.
9194354	eng	Tom said we should stop.
9194367	eng	I'm glad I can't go.
9194386	eng	I hesitated to call Tom.
9194419	eng	Tom can play the concertina.
9194434	eng	Boomerangs are tricky to throw.
9194439	eng	This is my brother Tom.
9194440	eng	This is my sister Mary.
9194445	eng	My sister is in college.
9194446	eng	Tom's cousin came to visit.
9194449	eng	Tom broke a world record.
9194463	eng	Is it because he's blond?
9194479	eng	I took Korean in college.
9194483	eng	My friend can't speak English.
9194494	eng	This has too many carbs.
9194524	eng	Sheep cheese is the best.
9194531	eng	I'm sick of it all.
9194560	eng	Do you want some dessert?
9194565	eng	Her eyes are very small.
9194566	eng	She has very small eyes.
9194568	eng	It rained nonstop last night.
9194572	eng	Ptolemy was a Greek astronomer.
9194574	eng	Bring me an iced coffee.
9194580	eng	You've got a big head.
9194583	eng	Take it in small doses.
9194585	eng	Tom said he did this.

9194619	eng	Guess whose birthday is today!
9194635	eng	I've looked out the window.
9194641	eng	I don't like making decisions.
9194649	eng	Who is she? Your girlfriend?
9194650	eng	Who is she, your girlfriend?

9194668	eng	I'm here for the money.
9194674	eng	Will you come eat tomorrow?
9194682	eng	It's easy to get infected.
9194687	eng	Back of the line, kid.
9194693	eng	It has a broken leg.
9194696	eng	The fair starts next week.
9194711	eng	I think Tom will complain.
9194717	eng	I'm heading over there now.
9194727	eng	You have a big head.
9194728	eng	We used to trust Tom.
9194732	eng	What's all the noise, Tom?
9194734	eng	Tom just left the room.
9194737	eng	I didn't expect you today.
9194740	eng	I don't mean any harm.
9194742	eng	It comes from the heart.
9194771	eng	Tom took care of me.
9194776	eng	Will Tom be on time?
9194784	eng	Why am I so unlucky?
9194820	eng	Tom has no classes tomorrow.
9194833	eng	I crashed into another car.
9194836	eng	It's my dad's birthday today.

9194882	eng	It's too bad that happened.
9194886	eng	Tom has a limp handshake.
9194909	eng	I keep forgetting your name.
9194914	eng	When will Tom do this?
9194921	eng	Tom had plenty of time.

9194947	eng	His wife is my friend.
9194948	eng	Are you a weight lifter?
9194955	eng	Tom may not want that.

9194977	eng	Tom read Mary's letter aloud.
9194992	eng	Tom has been mistreating me.
9194993	eng	I'm stuck in the car.
9194994	eng	Many people looked at Tom.
9195004	eng	I needed to do this.
9195005	eng	This is new to Tom.
9195057	eng	Tom considers Mary his girlfriend.
9195170	eng	The plan isn't ready yet.
9195188	eng	Have you cleaned your room?
9195230	eng	Let's tell Tom the truth.
9195236	eng	He's definitely passed the exam.

9195355	eng	Tom bought me some books.
9195366	eng	How did the game end?
9195372	eng	He was a simple man.
9195379	eng	This coat might suit you.

9195535	eng	I can call you later.
9195575	eng	The tomcat was sunning himself.
9195576	eng	Tom stuttered as a child.
9195580	eng	Bill Walton was a stutterer.
9195581	eng	Winston Churchill had a stammer.
9195592	eng	It's time to rise up.
9195612	eng	Maybe Tom is just hungry.
9195621	eng	Tom went to music school.
9195629	eng	Tom became a naturalized citizen.
9195648	eng	I was close, wasn't I?
9195649	eng	Tell me I was close.
9195650	eng	That was close, wasn't it?
9195656	eng	I had almost made it.
9195658	eng	I must be off now.
9195667	eng	My brothers are a handful.
9195672	eng	Fursuits are basically mascot suits.
9195683	eng	I got a little paranoid.
9195700	eng	Tom might not publish it.
9195722	eng	I think I found it.
9195725	eng	Why does Tom need it?
9195733	eng	Tom appears to be Canadian.
9195784	eng	Tom was still in danger.
9196143	eng	Does my smoking bother you?
9196229	eng	Tom decided to try again.
9196256	eng	Don't forget to thank Tom.
9196423	eng	Tom will be out soon.

9196602	eng	Radical Islamism is a problem.
9196603	eng	The mosque was temporarily closed.
9196735	eng	We get on pretty well.
9196761	eng	I sensed something was wrong.
9196768	eng	When will Tom get there?
9196980	eng	I'm staying home this summer.
9196983	eng	Go say goodbye to Tom.
9197019	eng	I did everything as agreed.
9197137	eng	Everything bad is equally bad.
9197255	eng	Tom heard footsteps following him.
9197500	eng	Of course, Tom is lying.
9197735	eng	You'd better listen to Tom.
9197873	eng	We will be living together.
9198194	eng	I'm happy Tom did it.
9198203	eng	I didn't utter a word.
9198204	eng	My hostage's name was Tom.
9198227	eng	I think this isn't mine.
9198285	eng	Tom was an amazing person.
9198295	eng	I don't feel like running.
9198313	eng	That was a bad joke.
9198329	eng	Doing that won't help Tom.
9198340	eng	Nobody in my family smokes.
9198352	eng	What constellations do you know?
9198354	eng	Do you have cheaper ones?
9198385	eng	I really like this shirt.
9198408	eng	Do you plan to come?
9198416	eng	Don't do everything at once.
9198419	eng	Did Tom ask for anything?
9198428	eng	I want a big chair.
9198467	eng	He couldn't play the guitar.
9198476	eng	We need to weigh this.
9198480	eng	Tom took off his sneakers.
9198483	eng	I arrived here yesterday evening.
9198518	eng	I adore the French language.
9198520	eng	Why's Tom smiling at us?
9198529	eng	Where did you get married?
9198533	eng	Tom texted me a lot.

9198602	eng	Tom went into the cabin.
9198612	eng	Tom turned off his flashlight.
9198694	eng	I really like your place.
9198799	eng	We ran out of space.
9198901	eng	I think we've forgotten someone.
9198930	eng	Go see how Tom is.
9199027	eng	Did Tom really do it?
9199072	eng	What can I give you?
9199077	eng	Tom, give Mary some tea.
9199082	eng	I listen to French radio.
9199102	eng	Why would Tom need it?
9199143	eng	Tom might do this now.
9199183	eng	Could you please speak faster?
9199199	eng	Tom can't stand up yet.
9199206	eng	Tom always gets his way.
9199221	eng	Tell Tom not to leave.
9199251	eng	Tom spoke almost perfect French.
9199331	eng	Tom ran to his apartment.
9199337	eng	I'm not stubborn. I'm persistent.
9199346	eng	I'll eat when I want.
9199350	eng	Tom kept his weapon ready.
9199363	eng	I got into debt again.
9199366	eng	Tom should still be here.
9199377	eng	Tom sent money to Mary.
9199381	eng	I've already had three beers.
9199385	eng	I play several wind instruments.
9199386	eng	I play several stringed instruments.
9199396	eng	Tom took it from me.
9199399	eng	I'm not a cat lover.
9199403	eng	Are video-game cutscene dialogues copyrighted?
9199406	eng	Tom let us do that.
9199415	eng	Tom works in a nursery.
9199433	eng	We never spoke to Tom.
9199440	eng	Tom took his sneakers off.
9199449	eng	Why would anyone kill Tom?
9199460	eng	What if they kill Tom?
9199462	eng	Don't you talk like that!
9199470	eng	I'll pray for you, Tom.
9199472	eng	Tom ran down the corridor.
9199493	eng	Tom was a street kid.
9199497	eng	Have you ever gone camping?
9199500	eng	I was in a band.
9199507	eng	It wasn't plugged in right.
9199541	eng	My teacher didn't like me.
9199549	eng	People grow up too fast.
9199550	eng	I'll go get some food.
9199564	eng	Tom's hiding in an alleyway.
9199598	eng	Who gave you that warrant?
9199605	eng	Tom was filled with joy.
9199621	eng	You should exercise some patience.
9199622	eng	Tom went to a tailor.
9199627	eng	It's worth reading that book.
9199628	eng	It's worth reading this book.
9199636	eng	Today's weather forecast was right.

9199664	eng	When does the train go?
9199669	eng	Should I tell Tom this?
9199678	eng	I promise I'll stop now.
9199701	eng	He said farewell and left.
9199703	eng	Parting was hard for him.
9199705	eng	Where were you this week?
9199710	eng	The ferry has entered port.
9199712	eng	The ferry came into port.
9199721	eng	She was doing the washing-up.
9199726	eng	That's where it all began.
9199780	eng	You're smiling again! Fancy that!
9199803	eng	Fortunately, it turned out well.
9199804	eng	Luckily, it turned out well.
9199847	eng	You haven't tied your shoelaces.
9199850	eng	You haven't tied your shoes.
9199852	eng	Handball is a team sport.
9199859	eng	Look in the rear-view mirror.
9199861	eng	Have you lost weight recently?
9199862	eng	Have you recently lost weight?
9199884	eng	I really don't like this.
9199908	eng	Pay attention to oncoming traffic.
9199920	eng	Tom gave Mary a bicycle.
9199934	eng	What have you been watching?
9199979	eng	Lent begins on Ash Wednesday.
9200047	eng	Can you make some room?
9200050	eng	Do you need some transport?
9200054	eng	He gave a fiery speech.
9200078	eng	The breakthrough has been made.
9200080	eng	Tom left with the loot.
9200155	eng	Do you have the list?
9200403	eng	But where is my tea?
9200415	eng	I got a nice letter.
9200454	eng	I'm going to Tom's now.
9200559	eng	This apple started to rot.
9200683	eng	I won't stay here long.
9200804	eng	I don't play these games.
9200805	eng	Why should I obey you?
9200809	eng	Come and see me sometime.
9200810	eng	Did you play tennis recently?
9200835	eng	Is there any phone nearby?
9200842	eng	My water bottle is empty.
9200846	eng	Some drugs cause liver damage.
9200878	eng	I have no money either.
9200887	eng	His presence makes me nervous.
9200888	eng	Her presence makes me nervous.
9200919	eng	Tom turned on his headlight.
9200929	eng	Negotiation with Tom exhausted me.
9201005	eng	When will Tom give up?
9201032	eng	I need a larger suitcase.
9201041	eng	Tom ended up losing money.
9201052	eng	Tom still can't do it.
9201054	eng	I love singing and dancing.
9201065	eng	I left right after you.
9201066	eng	Are you happy with Tom?
9201403	eng	Tom hid behind the couch.
9201441	eng	I got tired of laughing.
9201546	eng	I'm still working with Tom.
9201704	eng	Why's Tom richer than me?
9201842	eng	I feel sorry for everyone.
9201853	eng	Tom slipped Mary some money.
9201859	eng	It requires a little practice.
9201892	eng	What did I get wrong?
9201895	eng	Tom left on a bicycle.
9201902	eng	I am observing some changes.
9201908	eng	We'll cover all the costs.
9201913	eng	Did Tom actually do it?
9201954	eng	I can't accept this money.
9202179	eng	Tom said he'd do this.
9202203	eng	Is Tom also from Australia?
9202222	eng	Do you have a conscience?
9202330	eng	What Tom saw shocked him.
9202364	eng	It's not worth it, Tom.
9202365	eng	After that, Tom was fired.
9202544	eng	She didn't have any friends.
9202663	eng	All eyes were on Tom.
9202664	eng	Children like to play outside.
9202665	eng	She has her own house.
9202696	eng	He worries about the result.
9202721	eng	She pretended to enjoy it.
9202732	eng	Were you tested for COVID-19?
9202733	eng	Tom was tested for COVID-19.
9202736	eng	Tom tested negative for COVID-19.
9202747	eng	Obviously, the bus is late.
9202754	eng	Aren't cigarettes bad for you?
9202767	eng	Tom's grades are really low.
9202799	eng	I wish you were there.
9202808	eng	I'll cry in my room.
9202814	eng	I have to throw up.
9202848	eng	Smoking is forbidden in here.
9202852	eng	Tom was quiet in class.
9202855	eng	They're too many to count.
9202860	eng	He won't finish it today.
9202863	eng	She goes to the park.
9202865	eng	I was expecting you yesterday.
9202872	eng	Sign with a blue pen.
9202874	eng	He went down the stairs.
9202883	eng	You had to see me.
9202889	eng	My son is a widower.
9202926	eng	That's something I can’t guarantee.
9202928	eng	I can't guarantee you that.
9202936	eng	Can I make a call?
9202937	eng	I turn on the lamp.
9202941	eng	I'd like to sleep better.
9202962	eng	You're so full of yourself.
9202967	eng	Sometimes I work on holidays.
9202971	eng	She's a very famous person.
9202973	eng	She's a very well-known person.
9202976	eng	I usually sleep eight hours.
9202981	eng	He waited until the end.
9202988	eng	The shower is still occupied.
9202992	eng	Go check who it is.
9202995	eng	Have you stopped loving me?
9202996	eng	Say it however you want.
9203000	eng	Which seats do you prefer?
9203003	eng	Go see who it is.
9203009	eng	Surely it's closed by now.
9203027	eng	I wouldn't hurt a fly.
9203034	eng	I work more than you.
9203036	eng	I do what I enjoy.
9203060	eng	You confessed something to me.
9203061	eng	You admitted something to me.
9203114	eng	Dance with whoever you want.
9203116	eng	I've told you no already.
9203122	eng	Cicero's glory began to grow.
9203253	eng	Tom might not want dinner.
9203259	eng	I don't drink this stuff.
9203268	eng	Tom woke up very late.
9203392	eng	Everyone made fun of Tom.
9203453	eng	Tom may not want dinner.
9203487	eng	I already told you no.
9203492	eng	Someone's still in the shower.
9203499	eng	I already have other plans.
9203507	eng	I've already told you no.
9203521	eng	Tom doesn't have enough food.
9203550	eng	Go on ahead without me.
9203561	eng	I soon fell asleep, too.
9203570	eng	Tom will go for help.
9203571	eng	I think this should work.
9203572	eng	What made Tom do this?
9203585	eng	I don't like vulgar jokes.
9203590	eng	Tom turned and walked out.
9203596	eng	Tom turned his headlight on.
9203602	eng	Tom turned his headlights on.
9203606	eng	What did Tom call you?
9203609	eng	See who's at the door.
9203614	eng	Did you give Tom anything?
9203616	eng	Can I have a beer?
9203623	eng	I think you should apply.
9203626	eng	Not many people like opera.
9203627	eng	Tom bought a new horse.
9203636	eng	You'll say yes, won't you?
9203651	eng	Tom threw the bottle away.
9203654	eng	I certainly won't go there.
9203666	eng	Tom did me a favor.
9203693	eng	What if Tom was kidnapped?
9203701	eng	Did you miss my kisses?
9203710	eng	Does Tom do it often?
9203717	eng	My Berber class was cancelled.
9203722	eng	What are they rebelling against?
9203724	eng	It's hard to impress her.
9203767	eng	I must've gotten carried away.
9203769	eng	Tom could've done it himself.
9203771	eng	It's been an unproductive day.
9203774	eng	Her eyes spoke to me.
9203788	eng	Tom doesn't know too much.
9203807	eng	They got there already? When?
9203808	eng	They got here already? When?
9203816	eng	Tom stopped and looked up.
9203822	eng	I finally got it done.
9203836	eng	"Thanks." "What for?" "For everything."
9203837	eng	"Thanks." "For what?" "For everything."
9203883	eng	Everybody made fun of Tom.
9203895	eng	Tom turned off his headlight.
9203903	eng	I didn't have that chance.
9203954	eng	What will we do today?
9203987	eng	Does Tom keep his promises?
9204050	eng	Tom still needs to rest.
9204054	eng	I didn't understand at first.
9204171	eng	Try to allocate time well.
9204172	eng	There's room for one more.
9204189	eng	I don't like wearing vests.
9204191	eng	Why's Tom lying to me?
9204228	eng	Can I just say, wow.
9204240	eng	We found Tom's suicide note.
9204245	eng	That got dark really fast.
9204254	eng	Tom should do it, too.
9204264	eng	Come here, gimme a hug.
9204274	eng	Keep your eyes on Tom.
9204306	eng	I went to medical school.
9204345	eng	Hello. My name is Jabu.
9204348	eng	Can you see the cat?
9204380	eng	I’m going to wear jeans.
9204385	eng	Tom kept hitting on me.
9204390	eng	I'm not sorry I came.
9204404	eng	Don't mess up my lipstick.
9204408	eng	Yanni played a love song.
9204409	eng	Tom has a shrill voice.
9204426	eng	Bless your soul, my son.
9204489	eng	No one listened to Tom.
9204497	eng	That's going to be fun.
9204563	eng	We need flour and sugar.
9204793	eng	I'm trying to gain weight.
9204878	eng	There are no seats left.
9204879	eng	Tom called me a thug.
9204898	eng	I didn't listen to anyone.
9204911	eng	Tom ran after the boys.
9205074	eng	Why did you hang up?
9205222	eng	I need to call home.
9205442	eng	I asked Tom for water.
9205611	eng	They might need your help.
9205633	eng	He's like a Greek god.
9205790	eng	I'll be leaving next week.
9205857	eng	Which one did Tom choose?
9205892	eng	Why do you tolerate it?
9205914	eng	I'll see what's going on.
9205985	eng	Tom has never been stingy.
9205986	eng	Are you taking the pill?
9206198	eng	OK, I'll talk to Tom.
9206328	eng	They considered Tom a hero.
9206366	eng	I admire you a lot.
9206372	eng	We'd like to help, too.
9206420	eng	I'll upload it right away.
9206469	eng	Mary still plays the violin.
9206472	eng	The baby is still asleep.
9206533	eng	I don't need all this.
9206551	eng	My friend is an actress.
9206597	eng	Don't you mind waiting here?
9206641	eng	Is Tom younger than me?
9206728	eng	I'll never go home again.
9206854	eng	Tom may not want this.
9207080	eng	I don't shave every day.
9207191	eng	Things won't stay this way.
9207313	eng	What do you do now?
9207316	eng	I'm from a large family.
9207317	eng	No one saw Tom fall.
9207330	eng	I suspect that's a lie.
9207332	eng	That's what I hope happens.
9207335	eng	Tell Tom not to go.
9207354	eng	I'll do whatever you say.
9207355	eng	I wish I'd married Tom.
9207403	eng	I only have these three.
9207406	eng	I need a beer now.
9207419	eng	Who's that singing with Tom?
9207424	eng	Tom has to be there.
9207455	eng	Where can I hide this?
9207495	eng	I've done what you requested.
9207496	eng	Do you live with Tom?
9207497	eng	Are we not welcome here?
9207503	eng	What do you live on?
9207507	eng	Why do we need Tom?
9207509	eng	Tom just shook his head.
9207515	eng	Nobody blamed Tom for that.
9207517	eng	It was a rash move.
9207518	eng	Tom has hired a detective.
9207544	eng	You'd better tell Tom everything.
9207546	eng	Tom hid behind a curtain.
9207549	eng	I've finished all my homework.
9207564	eng	You should tell Tom everything.
9207583	eng	We heard nothing but crickets.
9207587	eng	I hope this ends soon.
9207592	eng	How does this help anyone?
9207606	eng	Tom didn't understand at first.
9207621	eng	I'll sell my car tomorrow.
9207623	eng	Ask Tom what he'll eat.
9207627	eng	Tom dashed to his room.
9207628	eng	Will you ever do that?
9207672	eng	Tom returned to the table.
9207762	eng	He was killed in action.
9207860	eng	You should see Tom now.
9207891	eng	How far can you swim?
9207970	eng	Do you have a ladder?
9207981	eng	Is Tom related to you?
9208010	eng	I think you behaved badly.
9208055	eng	How did he survive that?
9208172	eng	Yanni fancied himself a doctor.
9208295	eng	Tom might not see us.
9208296	eng	Yanni's grandad died in 2004.
9208299	eng	I need a physics tutor.
9208302	eng	The police are collecting evidence.
9208305	eng	Tom hid behind the truck.
9208357	eng	Yanni drove past that mosque.
9208358	eng	Yanni quit a month ago.
9208361	eng	Yanni loved everything about Algiers.
9208362	eng	I can't find my portfolio.
9208363	eng	Yanni is an early birdie.
9208404	eng	We're having a sale today.
9208433	eng	Do I turn you on?
9208459	eng	I often give Mary flowers.
9208472	eng	Mary was a good girl.
9208553	eng	Tom seemed to be anxious.
9208585	eng	She washed all the nappies.
9208590	eng	You can't only eat meat.
9208609	eng	Ropes alone cannot hold it.
9208667	eng	I wish you pleasant dreams.
9208909	eng	Give them back to Tom.
9209019	eng	The matter has been clarified.
9209061	eng	It's clear that you lied.
9209515	eng	Tom finds Australia very interesting.
9209521	eng	All our food was spoiled.
9209638	eng	Who is Tom walking with?
9209639	eng	With whom is Tom walking?
9209649	eng	Tom voted for Donald Trump.
9209650	eng	Tom swerved to the right.
9209864	eng	I'm writing a term paper.
9210091	eng	You can't change the world.
9210119	eng	I can't leave with you.
9210134	eng	He gave them the finger.
9210181	eng	The worst part is over.
9210216	eng	How is your little sister?
9210217	eng	Of course, I forgive Tom.
9210274	eng	Tomorrow will be even warmer.
9210276	eng	He was ill last week.
9210284	eng	I had a pleasant trip.
9210288	eng	We could all be wrong.
9210302	eng	I lost my cellphone charger.
9210303	eng	I love you very much!
9210304	eng	The boy eats a sausage.
9210307	eng	I sent Mary some roses.
9210360	eng	I'm not leaving for good.
9210365	eng	Don't do it on purpose.
9210368	eng	I couldn't find the toilet.
9210369	eng	You were following Tom. Why?
9210501	eng	I'm not saying it's easy.
9210521	eng	Why did Tom buy it?
9210609	eng	He was a successful businessman.
9210631	eng	Tom went inside the cabin.
9210666	eng	Go put the kettle on.
9210714	eng	I know who's behind this.
9210721	eng	Catch Tom if you can.
9210742	eng	Now, where do we go?
9210746	eng	Tom had to go out.
9210824	eng	Tom's attention turned to Mary.
9210936	eng	May I take a look?
9211000	eng	I was unemployed back then.
9211056	eng	I got them mixed up.
9211099	eng	I urgently need a doctor.
9211135	eng	Tom has many female friends.
9211137	eng	I often listen to music.
9211139	eng	Is Tom a good conversationalist?
9211142	eng	Tom wanted to make sure.
9211150	eng	I wish I'd studied more.
9211152	eng	What could I do there?
9211155	eng	I just couldn't afford it.
9211161	eng	Maybe we won't invite Tom.
9211165	eng	I think we were wrong.
9211166	eng	The spear didn't hit Tom.
9211169	eng	Tom was on the news.
9211171	eng	They didn't want Tom there.
9211173	eng	Tom rescued a stray cat.
9211174	eng	Tom fed the stray cat.
9211176	eng	Tom didn't speak to us.
9211178	eng	I have everything you need.
9211187	eng	Of course, I forgave Tom.
9211188	eng	Was it easy for you?
9211189	eng	Please listen to Tom carefully.
9211193	eng	I crammed for my exam.
9211206	eng	Tom was in a fraternity.
9211231	eng	Tell them that I'll come.
9211232	eng	Who's that swimming with Tom?
9211236	eng	The two girls sat down.
9211255	eng	Everyone attended the Halloween party.
9211266	eng	I like biscuits and gravy.
9211272	eng	Tom won't wait any longer.
9211283	eng	Tom didn't speak to anyone.
9211284	eng	Tom hasn't spoken with anybody.
9211285	eng	Tom hasn't spoken with anyone.
9211293	eng	It's fun being a kid.
9211301	eng	Your appointment is next week.
9211308	eng	Any idea where Tom is?
9211310	eng	Tom is an English learner.
9211313	eng	Tom was only wearing underwear.

9211611	eng	Mary – that's my name.
9211614	eng	Dan's coming here to recuperate.
9211617	eng	I hoped you would know.
9211629	eng	Lips get chapped in winter.
9211670	eng	Well, such things do happen.
9211672	eng	The room gradually got darker.
9211676	eng	Some things can't be explained.
9211682	eng	Stubbornness can ruin a friendship.
9211686	eng	A millennium comprises ten centuries.
9211688	eng	At last, some good news.
9211698	eng	The surprise left Marcus speechless.
9211705	eng	Her hearing is particularly acute.
9211706	eng	Does that happen every time?
9211709	eng	We will try another tactic.
9212957	eng	I was covered in sweat.
9212966	eng	It's a hot summer's day.
9215892	eng	Mary and Alice are pagan.
9216409	eng	Can we go through here?
9216477	eng	The goat's name is Tom.
9216522	eng	We ran out of candy.
9216537	eng	It tastes bland to me.
9216550	eng	Stop messing with my stuff.
9216626	eng	It smells fishy to me.
9216667	eng	Tom raced up the stairs.
9217241	eng	It seems suspicious to me.
9217390	eng	Tom can play the trumpet.
9217436	eng	I called a tow truck.
9217471	eng	What could I offer Tom?
9217706	eng	I promise I'll be careful.
9217747	eng	I feel sympathy for Tom.
9217822	eng	I took off my headphones.
9217915	eng	Has Tom gone to Boston?
9217976	eng	I dreamed about my mother.
9218004	eng	Did Tom suffer a lot?
9218180	eng	Tom left and won't return.
9218233	eng	I work with your boyfriend.
9218242	eng	Politicians really love to talk.
9218251	eng	What could I tell Tom?
9218396	eng	Who's that dancing with Tom?
9218429	eng	Of course, I'll forgive Tom.
9218517	eng	I can't sew or knit.
9218542	eng	I didn't agree right away.
9218565	eng	What if Tom doesn't come?
9218848	eng	Tom was cruel to Mary.
9218930	eng	I think Tom liked you.
9218988	eng	Tom dreamed of Mary often.
9218991	eng	Tom often dreamed of Mary.
9219026	eng	Tom was walking his dog.
9219270	eng	Do you recognize those people?
9219287	eng	Tom was sent to Australia.
9219294	eng	Tom hardly had any money.
9219536	eng	Tom may be leaving soon.
9219624	eng	Tom creeps me out sometimes.
9219637	eng	How could Tom get there?
9219690	eng	My father is very infirm.
9219777	eng	Tom rehearsed for three days.
9219983	eng	We haven't seen Tom today.
9220085	eng	I had a sleepless night.
9220170	eng	Tom really wants an apple.
9220312	eng	I thought you were alone.
9220467	eng	I see no other possibility.
9220647	eng	When can Tom do this?
9220683	eng	Tom came with his wife.
9220768	eng	Why did you get up?
9221014	eng	When can I go there?
9221052	eng	Tom would rather go alone.
9221092	eng	I'm starting to hate you.
9221380	eng	Tom made it very clear.
9221744	eng	Tom may have eaten it.
9221828	eng	Help Tom up the stairs.
9221899	eng	Tom forgot to do this.
9222152	eng	I just took a screenshot.
9222195	eng	What Tom said is insane.
9222446	eng	Tom won't do it now.
9222500	eng	I lit the short fuse.
9222525	eng	This is all Tom needs.
9222617	eng	Tom went back to class.
9222868	eng	Will we see you again?
9222919	eng	I still have that scar.
9223303	eng	Don't let Tom touch you.
9223395	eng	I feel like drinking wine.
9223545	eng	We should have a talk.
9223612	eng	I helped Tom do this.
9223721	eng	I'm wasting my time here.
9223816	eng	Did you go out today?
9224016	eng	The speaker spoke in English.
9224151	eng	Tom leaned on the railing.
9224721	eng	Tom studies in his room.
9224838	eng	I want you, not Tom.
9225297	eng	Tom jerked open the door.
9225414	eng	Look what Tom has done.
9225853	eng	I did it by mistake.
9225917	eng	Can you see my ribs?
9226229	eng	She dyed her hair gray.
9226305	eng	Tom didn't open his mouth.
9226345	eng	Is Yanni staying the night?
9226368	eng	Yanni was summoning a demon.
9226372	eng	The demon had human hands.
9226411	eng	Do you like my ass?
9226435	eng	Her sense of moral shame.
9226481	eng	What would you advise them?
9226520	eng	Tom couldn't get Mary's attention.
9226550	eng	Can you fix the door?
9226594	eng	Did we get any donations?
9226604	eng	Tom managed to outwit Mary.
9226608	eng	I just found my phone.
9226611	eng	That's all Tom left me.
9226619	eng	Tom lives on the coast.
9226672	eng	What did you call Tom?
9226771	eng	Did you see Tom there?
9226812	eng	Don't talk to Tom now.
9226848	eng	Does Tom ever do this?
9226853	eng	Tom can play the bugle.
9226910	eng	Please spare me some change.
9226929	eng	I'm very attached to Tom.
9226938	eng	This may be a fake.
9226964	eng	Tom might not want that.
9227076	eng	Don't let Tom scratch you.
9227101	eng	Who is walking the dog?
9227211	eng	I wasn't married back then.
9227220	eng	Does Tom like to dance?
9227251	eng	Esperanto has its own anthem.
9227270	eng	Which newspaper do you take?
9227276	eng	He slept all day yesterday.
9227277	eng	Buy it where you can.
9227295	eng	He was living there alone.
9227296	eng	I have no living relatives.
9227327	eng	I'm from the east coast.
9227353	eng	I set a collared trap.
9227357	eng	She was the neighborhood slut.
9227366	eng	I set a snare trap.
9227388	eng	Don't make any sudden movements.
9227393	eng	She's farting all the time.
9227403	eng	I'm tired. How about you?
9227405	eng	I'll try to persuade Tom.
9227414	eng	I hope they become friends.
9227951	eng	How are you doing lately?
9228703	eng	You are good at it.

9228904	eng	Tom's friend's name is Pierre.
9229220	eng	Tom speaks several foreign languages.
9229332	eng	Will you take Tom home?
9229363	eng	Mary isn't my wife anymore.
9229472	eng	It's snowing; welcome to November!
9229500	eng	Did Tom keep his promise?
9229518	eng	Tom seemed nice to me.
9229554	eng	I'll go to my room.
9229559	eng	Look, Tom is on TV.
9229643	eng	I didn't bring my gloves.
9229677	eng	Tom woke up in pain.
9229732	eng	Nobody I know misses Tom.
9229939	eng	I get paid for this.
9229952	eng	Tom hasn't been treated fairly.
9229972	eng	Both of us are grandfathers.
9229982	eng	I'll go and get it.
9229983	eng	I threw Tom the apple.
9229985	eng	They forgot to invite Tom.
9229994	eng	How have you been lately?
9230004	eng	We locked all the doors.
9230005	eng	This bicycle belongs to Tom.
9230007	eng	Don't ever come here again.
9230009	eng	I got here yesterday evening.
9230016	eng	The bus has been delayed.
9230017	eng	Smoking isn't allowed in here.
9230018	eng	Smoking isn't prohibited in here.
9230049	eng	Tom's puppy licked his hand.
9230050	eng	Tom's father suddenly became sick.
9230139	eng	Yanni rushed to the door.
9230145	eng	Yanni headed for the woods.
9230148	eng	Give the phone to Tom.
9230150	eng	It could be a coyote.
9230151	eng	I could be a deer.
9230168	eng	I'm having trouble hearing you.
9230188	eng	We have nowhere to go.
9230195	eng	Tom turned his flashlight off.
9230213	eng	Let's tell Tom about it.
9230226	eng	Tom made the next move.
9230290	eng	Tom might not want this.
9230294	eng	I am of Algerian descent.
9230361	eng	I don't disagree with you.
9230368	eng	Was it hard for you?
9230382	eng	Tom may do it himself.
9230391	eng	My back was killing me.
9230393	eng	Yanni looked angry, almost snarling.
9230429	eng	It was a bad sign.
9230445	eng	Yanni saw his mom there.
9230469	eng	Tom also drives a diesel.
9230544	eng	I just found out yesterday.
9230546	eng	This was all Tom needed.
9230555	eng	Yanni darted out of bed.
9230624	eng	Tom stayed by my side.
9230645	eng	I wanted some more information.
9230707	eng	We mentioned it to Tom.
9230753	eng	I'm not coming to Boston.
9230814	eng	It looks like Tom fainted.
9230872	eng	Pour some milk for Tom.
9230909	eng	I didn't eat much yesterday.
9230940	eng	What books has Tom read?
9231006	eng	I bought you a motorcycle.
9231069	eng	No dream lasts a lifetime.
9231101	eng	I don't eat ice cream.
9231115	eng	How could you believe Tom?
9231129	eng	All dreams don't last long.
9231229	eng	Will you be back soon?
9231289	eng	We got back to school.
9231360	eng	Tom left the door ajar.
9231435	eng	Try to call Tom again.
9231668	eng	One day you'll regret this.
9231698	eng	I'm unable to pay now.
9231734	eng	Generally, the Japanese are diligent.
9231812	eng	I like painting with watercolors.
9231838	eng	Did you wake Tom up?
9231865	eng	We slept all day yesterday.
9231877	eng	What if Tom doesn't call?
9232092	eng	I thought it was easy.
9232104	eng	Will Tom do this, too?
9232292	eng	Tom has a huge beard.
9232383	eng	Maybe Tom is just worried.
9232526	eng	I don't remember my mother.
9232541	eng	I didn't hear Tom's footsteps.
9232564	eng	Those aren't our worst problems.
9232729	eng	Do you still hate Tom?
9232770	eng	Tom still might do it.
9232847	eng	You should call Tom now.
9232856	eng	I can't let Tom down.
9232865	eng	Eight is four times two.
9232868	eng	I exercise whenever I can.
9232874	eng	You need to find Tom.

9246578	eng	Our schedule changes a lot.
9246612	eng	We want to be alone.
9246613	eng	Tom jacked the car up.
9246630	eng	I want you to understand.
9246634	eng	Tom was fond of fishing.
9246638	eng	Tom is a dishonest person.
