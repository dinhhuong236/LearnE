8503517	eng	It's greater than 10.
8503639	eng	No, I don't agree.
8503663	eng	What have you chosen?
8503664	eng	What have you picked?
8503665	eng	What did you choose?
8503666	eng	What did you pick?
8503770	eng	It's a game changer.
8503771	eng	Be willing to change.
8503772	eng	Has that all changed?
8503774	eng	It changed them both.
8503780	eng	It changes your life.
8503783	eng	It's changed my life.
8503785	eng	It's changed so much.
8503791	eng	That changed my life.
8503796	eng	That needs to change.
8503797	eng	That's got to change.
8503804	eng	This has all changed.
8503813	eng	Real change is needed.
8503815	eng	We made three changes.
8503816	eng	Real change takes time.
8503818	eng	That'll have to change.
8503819	eng	That's going to change.
8503820	eng	The rules don't change.
8503822	eng	The world needs change.

8503828	eng	All that's changing now.
8503829	eng	Change your air filters.
8503835	eng	It's changed since then.
8503838	eng	One thing never changes.
8503841	eng	That law hasn't changed.
8503851	eng	My plans haven't changed.
8503854	eng	Nothing will change here.
8503858	eng	The rules haven't changed.
8503910	eng	Cats are very affectionate.
8504024	eng	I'm not speaking English.
8504994	eng	I need a team.
8505008	eng	Rob is my friend.
8505012	eng	I'm four weeks pregnant.
8505189	eng	Tom hired a cook.
8505190	eng	I wasn't hurt badly.

8505283	eng	Tom has been duped.
8505336	eng	Tom has been there.
8505342	eng	Snow falls every day.
8505358	eng	Tom has done worse.
8505390	eng	Why call Tom now?
8505391	eng	Tom hired a lawyer.
8505409	eng	I wasn't home yesterday.
8505464	eng	Tom left me behind.
8505470	eng	What an interesting adventure!
8505483	eng	Slums can be dangerous.
8505484	eng	I came here today.
8505492	eng	Tom liked to dance.
8505498	eng	Tom liked to drink.
8505502	eng	It's cool out here.
8505505	eng	Tom liked to party.
8505507	eng	It's warm out here.
8505530	eng	Tom pays the bills.
8505531	eng	It's not the policy.
8505535	eng	It's quiet out here.
8505536	eng	Tom played with us.
8505537	eng	It's so obvious now.
8505541	eng	It's soft and fuzzy.
8505543	eng	It's the same today.
8505545	eng	Tom quit on Monday.
8505550	eng	It's very nice here.
8505553	eng	It's very well done.
8505556	eng	It's very, very bad.
8505557	eng	Tom sat down first.
8505558	eng	It's what people do.
8505560	eng	It's what they want.
8505567	eng	Our work isn't done.
8505569	eng	That isn't so today.
8505576	eng	Tom should call me.
8505578	eng	This could be fatal.
8505581	eng	This group is smart.
8505589	eng	This is a democracy.
8505592	eng	This is a non-issue.
8505598	eng	This is mostly true.
8505599	eng	Tom snitched on us.
8505602	eng	This is nothing new.
8505603	eng	You're doing something wrong.
8505604	eng	This is partly true.
8505608	eng	Tom spoke his mind.
8505611	eng	This is pretty neat.
8505614	eng	This isn't a debate.
8505625	eng	This isn't a museum.
8505626	eng	Tom stole my phone.
8505630	eng	This isn't a prison.
8505634	eng	This place is crazy.
8505636	eng	This plan is flawed.
8505638	eng	Thugs will be thugs.
8505640	eng	Time isn't an issue.
8505643	eng	Tom talked with me.
8505644	eng	Well, neither do you.
8505655	eng	Wow! That's too bad.
8505658	eng	Tom texted me back.
8505661	eng	Yeah, I'd like that.
8505665	eng	I've bought a ticket.
8505667	eng	That's an old saying.
8505668	eng	Tom took the blame.
8505673	eng	Very well done, guys.
8505681	eng	Wait until next year.
8505684	eng	Tom took the stand.
8505685	eng	We'll get that fixed.
8505697	eng	We're open every day.
8505699	eng	Tom wanted to move.
8505702	eng	Well, that's too bad.
8505705	eng	You're a pretty girl.
8505710	eng	That isn't true today.
8505711	eng	Tom was in control.
8505727	eng	That's not the system.
8505737	eng	That's what people do.
8505739	eng	That's what they want.
8505740	eng	Tom won't run away.
8505742	eng	This isn't very clear.
8505744	eng	This isn't very sweet.
8505745	eng	Tom won't trust me.
8505751	eng	Tom wore a T-shirt.
8505775	eng	He hates the rules.
8505776	eng	His leg is healing.
8505789	eng	He joined the navy.
8505796	eng	Tom saw Mary smoking.
8505797	eng	That's why it's big.
8505849	eng	He works in archeology.
8505850	eng	He's a brave skydiver.
8505860	eng	He's facing a challenge.
8505862	eng	His answer surprised me.
8505873	eng	He's a responsible driver.
8505879	eng	His birthday was yesterday.
8505960	eng	Tom has misled me.
8506058	eng	Tom stole someone's wallet.
8506480	eng	Adult tickets are $13.00.
8506485	eng	Your band sounded great.
8506526	eng	Are these really Tom's?
8506529	eng	Are Tom's claims valid?
8506532	eng	I'm grateful for this.
8506537	eng	At least, nobody died.
8506551	eng	It's twenty to two.
8506554	eng	Don't blow your cool.
8506561	eng	Don't bet against it.
8506579	eng	Do you remember 2013?
8506586	eng	Do anything you want.
8506609	eng	Come on, get serious.
8506623	eng	Come again next year.
8506630	eng	Check out what's new.
8506636	eng	Bears are very smart.
8506645	eng	Be grateful for this.
8506653	eng	Australia is my home.
8506706	eng	Are your kids stupid?
8506739	eng	Are you sitting down?
8506858	eng	All right, calm down.
8506909	eng	All right, I'll come.
8506943	eng	All are good options.
8506967	eng	You've got it right.
8507001	eng	You're such a loser.
8507054	eng	It'll be a struggle.
8507067	eng	Did you buy tickets?
8507083	eng	"Thanks." "No, thank YOU!"
8507086	eng	Tom has denied it.
8507122	eng	We only accept cash.
8507156	eng	I've only got one.
8507160	eng	The game was fixed.
8507161	eng	The match was fixed.
8507163	eng	The game was rigged.
8507376	eng	It's half past nine.
8507466	eng	January is over already.
8507645	eng	Some people fight back.
8508262	eng	He's always watching television.
8508281	eng	He finally quit smoking.
8508282	eng	He escaped the danger.
8508286	eng	He broke the glass.
8508392	eng	Mine is that one.
8508405	eng	Go back to Boston.
8508411	eng	I'm a cat lover.
8508416	eng	Here's what I got.
8508424	eng	It's not my money.
8508432	eng	It's what dogs do.
8508437	eng	My family is safe.
8508460	eng	She's a Sephardic Jew.
8508469	eng	It boggled my mind.
8508481	eng	It's a real threat.
8508497	eng	It's all they have.
8508503	eng	It's all we've got.
8508520	eng	It's blue in color.
8508534	eng	It's just not true.
8508543	eng	It's pink, not red.
8508563	eng	Its color is brown.
8508600	eng	We were so excited.
8508681	eng	It isn't a priority.
8508684	eng	It's not a priority.
8508698	eng	It's more than that.
8508714	eng	Its color is yellow.
8508720	eng	Many people do that.
8508735	eng	Many people said no.
8508742	eng	Place your bets now.
8508765	eng	Who'll you eat with?
8508774	eng	Don't bump your head.
8508778	eng	Don't deny the facts.
8508806	eng	Don't drive too fast.
8508826	eng	Don't get thrown out.
8508834	eng	Don't give into fear.
8508840	eng	Don't kiss in public.
8508845	eng	Don't listen to them.
8508853	eng	Don't take any risks.
8508926	eng	Dress will be casual.
8508962	eng	Don't drive that slow.
8508984	eng	Education is the key.
8508995	eng	Go back to Australia.
8508997	eng	The boot is open.
8509019	eng	Guess which is which.
8509048	eng	Who took my pen?
8509049	eng	I know this music.
8509051	eng	This is too heavy.
8509053	eng	Help is still needed.
8509062	eng	You were very convincing.
8509065	eng	Have you learned anything?
8509069	eng	Security has been tightened.
8509070	eng	Things have finally changed.
8509071	eng	Please restart your computer.
8509106	eng	Here is no different.
8509111	eng	Here's a better plan.
8509124	eng	Here's a work around.
8509144	eng	Here's an easier way.
8509178	eng	Here's how it worked.
8509204	eng	Here's how it's done.
8509218	eng	Here's what it means.
8509238	eng	Hey, it could happen.
8509254	eng	Hold your heads high.
8509258	eng	I've read about that.
8509268	eng	Is it getting bigger?
8509277	eng	Is that case settled?
8509280	eng	Is the chimney clean?
8509285	eng	Is there another way?
8509288	eng	It almost isn't fair.
8509291	eng	It boggled our minds.
8509293	eng	It didn't look right.
8509296	eng	It doesn't affect me.
8509304	eng	It doesn't cost much.
8509307	eng	It doesn't end there.
8509312	eng	It doesn't take long.
8509322	eng	It happened at night.
8509325	eng	It happens every day.
8509335	eng	It isn't October yet.
8509339	eng	It isn't their money.
8509343	eng	It isn't very common.
8509349	eng	It makes total sense.
8509356	eng	It seemed so surreal.
8509361	eng	It starts from there.
8509365	eng	It starts right here.
8509368	eng	Peter is very strict.
8509370	eng	It surprised me, too.
8509391	eng	It was an eye-opener.
8509395	eng	It was just terrible.
8509454	eng	It was so unexpected.
8509463	eng	It was very dramatic.
8509475	eng	It was very worrying.
8509494	eng	It wasn't even close.
8509517	eng	It'll be a challenge.
8509559	eng	It'll blow your mind.
8509564	eng	It'll never get done.
8509570	eng	It'll only get worse.
8509574	eng	It'll open your eyes.
8509577	eng	It's a bad situation.
8509584	eng	It's a big challenge.
8509591	eng	It's a bit technical.
8509597	eng	It's a critical fact.
8509628	eng	It's a crucial stage.
8509654	eng	The ferret is asleep.
8509655	eng	It's a delicate time.
8509662	eng	It's a fun situation.
8509677	eng	It's a great company.
8509698	eng	It's a great rivalry.
8509716	eng	Tom made Mary mad.
8509735	eng	It's a great theater.
8509769	eng	It's a guessing game.
8509775	eng	It's a little unfair.
8509778	eng	It's a longish story.
8509782	eng	It's a one-shot deal.
8509807	eng	It's a proven system.
8509831	eng	Tom has kids now.
8509832	eng	It's a rare disorder.
8509837	eng	No one recognized Tom.
8509848	eng	It's a sad situation.
8509855	eng	It's a serious issue.
8509874	eng	Tom isn't my dad.
8509880	eng	Tom has children now.
8509886	eng	It's a serious thing.
8509914	eng	It's a simple choice.
8509940	eng	It's a simple system.
8509957	eng	It's a stable system.
8509962	eng	It's a stressful job.
8510003	eng	It's a terrible idea.
8510055	eng	It's a terrific idea.
8510085	eng	It's a tough economy.
8510094	eng	It's a tough process.
8510121	eng	It's about that time.
8510128	eng	It's all luck anyway.
8510133	eng	It's all over, right?
8510140	eng	It's all they've got.
8510150	eng	Tom is quite clumsy.
8510152	eng	It's also really fun.
8510160	eng	It's an amazing plan.
8510179	eng	Stop opening those drawers.
8510189	eng	He felt so bad.
8510193	eng	It's an easy process.
8510196	eng	He talked about stealing.
8510227	eng	Tom suddenly got up.
8510248	eng	It's an equity issue.
8510266	eng	He offered his assistance.
8510275	eng	He really hated that.
8510291	eng	It's an immense task.
8510308	eng	It's an old building.
8510313	eng	Tom didn't have kids.
8510321	eng	It's been rough here.
8510328	eng	It's bound to happen.
8510333	eng	It's cheaper to rent.
8510337	eng	It's good for morale.
8510343	eng	It's good, clean fun.
8510347	eng	It's happening a lot.
8510356	eng	Tom's time is up.
8510357	eng	It's ideal, isn't it?
8510373	eng	It's indeed very sad.
8510379	eng	It's just a business.
8510389	eng	Tom didn't hit anyone.
8510392	eng	He definitely heard me.
8510394	eng	She definitely heard me.
8510395	eng	He'll definitely hear me.
8510396	eng	She'll definitely hear me.
8510397	eng	They definitely heard me.
8510399	eng	They'll definitely hear me.
8510400	eng	It's just an opinion.
8510401	eng	It's just really fun.
8510403	eng	It's just really sad.
8510406	eng	Tom doesn't earn much.
8510408	eng	It's kind of amazing.
8510411	eng	It's kind of surreal.
8510422	eng	It's less than ideal.
8510431	eng	It's meant to happen.
8510435	eng	It's more common now.
8510439	eng	It's not October yet.
8510448	eng	It's not about trust.
8510449	eng	Tom didn't hit anybody.
8510450	eng	It's not fun anymore.
8510452	eng	It's not quite clear.
8510455	eng	It's not their money.
8510458	eng	It's not very common.
8510461	eng	It's offensive to me.
8510465	eng	It's orange in color.
8510467	eng	Tom didn't have children.
8510468	eng	It's pretty far away.
8510473	eng	It's quiet out there.
8510474	eng	It's red, not orange.
8510476	eng	Tom doesn't like anybody.
8510477	eng	It's simply not fair.
8510480	eng	It's simply not true.
8510484	eng	It's slow, very slow.
8510486	eng	It's time to confess.
8510489	eng	It's tough out there.
8510493	eng	It's tough right now.
8510504	eng	It's very, very good.
8510529	eng	It's very, very hard.
8510531	eng	It's way better here.
8510575	eng	It's what artists do.
8510578	eng	It's what coaches do.
8510582	eng	It's why you're here.
8510585	eng	Jobs are needed here.
8510591	eng	Just don't look down.
8510594	eng	Just forget about it.
8510599	eng	Just let everyone in.
8510602	eng	Just repeat after me.
8510604	eng	Kids are people, too.
8510607	eng	Let the mixture cool.
8510610	eng	Let's try doing that.
8510613	eng	Life isn't like that.
8510616	eng	Life's not like that.
8510619	eng	Listen to each other.
8510622	eng	Look a little closer.
8510625	eng	Maybe it's like that.
8510627	eng	Maybe you deserve it.
8510631	eng	Money can't buy that.
8510634	eng	No decision was made.
8510641	eng	Nobody had any money.
8510649	eng	No one recognized me.
8510654	eng	Nobody knew about it.
8510660	eng	Nothing is ever easy.
8510703	eng	One day isn't enough.
8510706	eng	One woman was killed.
8510709	eng	People are dying now.
8510714	eng	People came en masse.
8510717	eng	Please send us money.
8510729	eng	Sales are still good.
8510742	eng	Thanks for your post.
8510751	eng	That advice paid off.
8510756	eng	That can happen, too.
8510762	eng	That didn't work out.
8510765	eng	That got me thinking.
8510771	eng	That got us thinking.
8510788	eng	That isn't an option.
8510798	eng	That made me curious.
8510814	eng	That made me nervous.
8510821	eng	That still haunts me.
8510839	eng	That was decades ago.
8510843	eng	That was good enough.
8510850	eng	That was great stuff.
8510862	eng	That wasn't too hard.
8510871	eng	That won't affect us.
8510874	eng	That won't last long.
8510892	eng	That's a common myth.
8510913	eng	That's not all, folks.
8510946	eng	That's a fire hazard.
8510947	eng	That's the best part.
8510951	eng	That's a great asset.
8510955	eng	What's the real goal?
8510956	eng	That's the sad truth.
8510957	eng	That's up for debate.
8510959	eng	That's a lovely idea.
8510963	eng	That's a new message.
8510967	eng	That's a proven fact.
8511001	eng	Where's the volume control?
8511014	eng	That's a rare luxury.
8511054	eng	That's a red herring.
8511104	eng	That's all I'm doing.
8511124	eng	That's all we wanted.
8511150	eng	That's going too far.
8511178	eng	That's great to hear.
8511207	eng	That's how we'll win.
8511222	eng	That's in poor taste.
8511224	eng	That's just about it.
8511267	eng	That's just my guess.
8511269	eng	That's just not cool.
8511292	eng	That's my goal today.

8511405	eng	We needed more money.
8511410	eng	Where is your helmet?
8511437	eng	Doing that looks easy.
8511532	eng	Here are some reasons.
8511538	eng	Who wants to start?
8511656	eng	It feels warmer today.
8511670	eng	It happened real fast.
8511693	eng	It weighed three tons.
8511772	eng	It's what teachers do.
8511779	eng	Just let everybody in.
8511843	eng	Nobody does that here.
8511874	eng	That didn't offend me.
8511877	eng	That makes me nervous.
8511898	eng	That's not a priority.
8511937	eng	Doing that makes sense.
8511968	eng	Get your tickets today.
8511972	eng	Here come the children.
8512023	eng	I have three questions.
8512230	eng	Is this already cooked?
8512536	eng	It's what musicians do.
8512634	eng	It's an environmental disaster.
8512675	eng	Many Canadians do that.
8512776	eng	Many people don't care.
8512859	eng	Nobody does that alone.

8513256	eng	That's also true today.
8513259	eng	That's an amazing plan.
8513262	eng	That's flat out racist.
8513266	eng	That's just an opinion.
8513269	eng	That's our major focus.

9162719	eng	The stove is broken.
9162763	eng	I need an advance.
9162780	eng	What will we play?
9162791	eng	I hate greedy people.
9162804	eng	The hatch is open.
9162858	eng	We don't need it.
9163072	eng	Did you tell anyone?
9163081	eng	I'm a systems analyst.
9163091	eng	You'd better get out.
9163200	eng	Leave the window open.
9163211	eng	Whose voice is that?
9163247	eng	Tom lied to everybody.
9163252	eng	Did Tom just call?
9163259	eng	You only die once.
9163264	eng	All states are illegitimate.
9163282	eng	Send me Tom's number.
9163296	eng	It made Tom giggle.
9163301	eng	Yanni was fondling Skura.
9163311	eng	You should take this.
9163312	eng	Do you speak Occitan?
9163324	eng	The door is blocked.
9163326	eng	Is Tom coming, too?
9163328	eng	We drank some water.
9163379	eng	You'd better go first.
9163387	eng	That one is mine.
9163424	eng	What did you ask?
9163474	eng	Why all this hype?
9163499	eng	Tom joined our club.
9163541	eng	Tom lied to everyone.
9163582	eng	Wait for my call.
9163635	eng	You'd better not sing.
9163820	eng	You ruined the show.
9163837	eng	This is a mug.
9164006	eng	Tom only teaches boys.
9164060	eng	We talked about you.
9164081	eng	Tom feeds stray dogs.
9164107	eng	This book is easy.
9164119	eng	Tom spoke very softly.
9164123	eng	Nobody listened to Tom.
9164177	eng	These are our rules.
9164287	eng	Messi will play tomorrow.
9164293	eng	Tom resumed his seat.
9164316	eng	Do you sell cookies?
9164328	eng	Tom hired a detective.
9164337	eng	I use wooden clothespins.
9164378	eng	I'm thinking about something.
9164446	eng	Tom made you pancakes.
9164517	eng	Tom knows about this.

9165038	eng	Mary is cooking breakfast.
9165109	eng	Tom got really fat.
9165127	eng	The yard is flooded.
9165146	eng	Tom's knee is fine.
9165147	eng	The house was quiet.
9165212	eng	Who's Tom drinking with?
9165252	eng	This house is theirs.
9165306	eng	Tom began to stammer.
9165314	eng	It's an even number.
9165315	eng	I admire your endurance.
9165316	eng	The answer is wrong.
9165323	eng	My diet isn't healthy.
9165325	eng	How's Tom doing there?
9165327	eng	Don't read that book!
9165332	eng	You didn't eat much.
9165361	eng	This is a mat.
9165392	eng	You must go there.
9165396	eng	Tom didn't win anything.
9165399	eng	This is a gem.
9165403	eng	Ah, there Tom is.
9165438	eng	You must obey me.
9165449	eng	Tom brought Mary breakfast.
9165537	eng	I never understood it.
9165569	eng	This is a zoo.
9165571	eng	Sit here for now.
9165576	eng	Come here right away.
9165598	eng	Shake well before serving.
9165601	eng	I'm a magical unicorn.
9165604	eng	Where's the registration booth?
9165608	eng	This kid is great.
9165618	eng	We're a little anxious.
9165653	eng	Not everyone likes Tom.
9165712	eng	I really need Tom.
9165717	eng	Tom's cat is cute.
9165741	eng	Tom takes big risks.
9165811	eng	You can still win.
9165833	eng	Is Mary your niece?
9165861	eng	Today's not Tom's birthday.
9165877	eng	Don't count on us.
9165882	eng	I shouldn't have refused.
9165904	eng	I love this world.
9165920	eng	Whose van is that?
9165922	eng	Tom's a dangerous man.
9165933	eng	Mary lost her baby.

9166138	eng	You have to confess.
9166164	eng	Tom's company was sued.
9166345	eng	We all stayed silent.
9166413	eng	Use the trash bin.

9166471	eng	Bring down the barrier.
9166507	eng	Congratulations, friend of mine!
9166516	eng	You sound really annoyed.
9166535	eng	Pass me that magazine.
9166539	eng	You sound ticked off.
9166559	eng	Did Tom help you?
9166604	eng	Tom hasn't yet registered.
9166670	eng	He's a down-and-out guy.
9166684	eng	I like his hair.

9166720	eng	Your watch is digital.
9166722	eng	Your clock is digital.
9166746	eng	I'm just telling that.
9167044	eng	Today is very windy.
9167060	eng	Why should Tom stop?
9167065	eng	Tom never juggles anymore.
9167072	eng	Did Tom invite you?
9167095	eng	Are you coming soon?
9167110	eng	Show Tom something else.
9167133	eng	The milk is frozen.
9167143	eng	I've never beat Tom.
9167257	eng	Yanni slowed his running.
9167258	eng	Yanni called Skura's name.
9167261	eng	The police has arrived.
9167270	eng	I'm talking about sex.
9167393	eng	It looks like it.
9167542	eng	Do you feel stressed?
9167626	eng	Staying home isn't pleasant.
9167666	eng	I just met them.
9167920	eng	I still got it.
9168049	eng	We were very comfortable.
9168112	eng	They left the group.
9168971	eng	I had the scissors.
9169022	eng	Do you study numerology?
9169072	eng	Don't let them fall.
9169097	eng	Why do they work?
9169108	eng	They need to wait.
9169177	eng	I'm a bit strange.
9169213	eng	We weren't very clever.
9169241	eng	No one asked him.
9169258	eng	He's going to dance.
9169300	eng	What a bad day!
9169302	eng	What a sucky day!
9169319	eng	We respect the regulation.
9169383	eng	I heard you two.
9169487	eng	Being alone is nice.
9169685	eng	Don't go that fast.
9169721	eng	They both passed away.
9169762	eng	My perspective has changed.
9169993	eng	I'd like a glass.
9170197	eng	Let them go in.
9171018	eng	You scared them off.
9171023	eng	Tom bought a house.
9171036	eng	This is a nut.
9171050	eng	Tom sympathizes with me.
9171055	eng	I recognize those dogs.
9171070	eng	Tom was very wrong.
9171081	eng	My suitcases are full.
9171125	eng	I like rosé better.
9171141	eng	Is that your boy?
9171142	eng	Is that your girl?

9171189	eng	Tom was very tactful.
9171210	eng	Tom adopted a puppy.
9171219	eng	This beer is cold.
9171226	eng	Didn't it bother you?
9171236	eng	I don't like cucumbers.
9171239	eng	Here are your books.
9171240	eng	These are my things.
9171255	eng	You saved my skin.
9171261	eng	This is very small.
9171263	eng	Tell Tom I'll come.
9171267	eng	Tom's request was denied.
9171268	eng	Here are your sunglasses.
9171270	eng	They've already been alerted.
9171278	eng	Tom still ignores me.
9171279	eng	Tom ignored my request.
9171294	eng	Stop hanging around here.
9171297	eng	I unwrapped the package.
9171312	eng	This is a tie.
9171331	eng	Tom has fat legs.
9171334	eng	You need to confess.
9171339	eng	This is a clue.
9171346	eng	Let's tell Tom everything.
9171350	eng	My car got scratched.
9171354	eng	Not many people came.
9171373	eng	I still need it.
9171380	eng	Is it time already?
9171409	eng	I wanted that car.
9171429	eng	Is this a bribe?
9171481	eng	Go to the kitchen.
9171495	eng	Are those plastic fangs?
9171532	eng	You should go last.
9171595	eng	Has anyone informed Tom?
9171598	eng	You can sit down.
9171626	eng	Tom never cheated again.
9171683	eng	You know my terms.
9171694	eng	This cartoon is funny.
9171698	eng	Is Tom better already?
9171718	eng	Tom arrived last Monday.
9171748	eng	Is this a prank?
9171773	eng	This is a pot.
9171781	eng	Let's leave it here.
9171827	eng	You eat a lot.
9171838	eng	Our turn is next.
9171848	eng	It was cold today.
9172038	eng	I would've done better.
9172066	eng	Tom laughed at us.
9172129	eng	That won't stop Tom.
9172130	eng	We were left alone.
9172136	eng	Is that Tom's bike?
9172276	eng	Is that a lizard?
9172459	eng	Why's Tom so skeptical?
9172498	eng	The fan is broken.
9172641	eng	The sky was cloudy.
9172650	eng	Tom has the advantage.
9172724	eng	Does Tom also sing?
9172888	eng	Is Tom blackmailing you?
9172958	eng	I wanted a sister.
9173036	eng	Today is the twentieth.
9173063	eng	Tom was apparently drunk.
9173304	eng	He is very afraid.
9173316	eng	Which one is older?
9173829	eng	When can we talk?
9175540	eng	He makes absurd threats.
9175911	eng	My girlfriend loves rings.
9176144	eng	Mary is my great-niece.
9176194	eng	The milk was frozen.
9176210	eng	This wine is cheap.
9176224	eng	Nobody talks like that.
9176244	eng	I don't like hospitals.
9176259	eng	Add the remaining ingredients.
9176282	eng	This is a key.
9176331	eng	You won the contest.
9176332	eng	Tom doesn't ever swear.
9176348	eng	This isn't our stop.
9176355	eng	I won't survive this.
9176364	eng	She won't help us.
9176373	eng	It won't help Tom.
9176429	eng	I've already called everyone.
9176443	eng	Have you called everyone?
9176445	eng	I've written to everyone.
9176486	eng	Maybe this is love.
9176498	eng	Unfortunately, Tom didn't come.
9176536	eng	What did they eat?
9176564	eng	I'm a little stiff.
9176579	eng	What's an isosceles triangle?
9176580	eng	What's a right triangle?
9176583	eng	Is it Monday today?
9176589	eng	I wanna say sorry.
9176592	eng	It froze last night.
9176598	eng	It's not worth saying.
9176612	eng	I'm likely to win.
9176616	eng	Don't lock me out.
9176622	eng	You did well here.
9176641	eng	This pond is shallow.
9176657	eng	Alright, don't be long.
9176663	eng	That rumor isn't true.
9176671	eng	You're a free man.
9176675	eng	Tom's testimony was false.
9176678	eng	This is a jar.
9176680	eng	Are these Tom's things?
9176696	eng	This is a plate.
9176698	eng	Go at it hard.
9176710	eng	Looks like you're happy.
9176713	eng	You sure look cheerful.
9176714	eng	She screams too much.
9176719	eng	That test's too hard.
9176720	eng	It's a great pleasure.
9176733	eng	Whose son is he?
9176734	eng	Whose son is this?
9176749	eng	You've warned me already.
9176752	eng	It's written in lowercase.
9176755	eng	She's a good student.
9176761	eng	Tom won't tell anyone.
9176765	eng	Don't read that book.
9176776	eng	We found it alive.
9176818	eng	Tom mixed everything up.
9176833	eng	You weren't on time.
9176841	eng	It'll be dreadfully hot.
9176842	eng	It'll be really hot.
9176843	eng	It'll be very hot.
9176844	eng	It'll be quite hot.
9176861	eng	The wall is dirty.
9176868	eng	Who's Tom working with?
9176887	eng	The director reprimanded Tom.
9176891	eng	Tom wants to drink.
9176898	eng	We relied on Tom.
9176903	eng	You speak fluent French.
9176904	eng	You speak French fluently.
9176926	eng	You've grown a lot.
9176947	eng	This is a bat.
9176949	eng	Doesn't Tom trust Mary?
9176954	eng	Would you wear this?
9176978	eng	She killed the wolf.
9176983	eng	I paid and left.
9176999	eng	I left after paying.
9177033	eng	Tom caught a seagull.
9177035	eng	I couldn't kill anybody.
9177043	eng	That won't help Tom.
9177044	eng	I'm not closing them.
9177073	eng	This song hits hard.
9177079	eng	The carpet is worn.
9177093	eng	What I can do?
9177107	eng	Are you approaching me?
9177135	eng	Doing that is discouraged.
9177140	eng	We saw a lion.
9177166	eng	You aren't my wife.
9177171	eng	Tom likes rye bread.
9177234	eng	Tom approached the house.

9177828	eng	I'm the youngest here.
9177921	eng	I'm not joking, Tom.
9177961	eng	Our light went out.
9177992	eng	You won't fool me.
9178051	eng	Put on your robe.
9178077	eng	Is anybody else coming?
9178081	eng	What scared Tom off?

9178166	eng	She didn't get married.
9178214	eng	We sat and smoked.
9178223	eng	I don't like ironing.

9180617	eng	Who lives above you?
9180661	eng	Tom scanned the list.
9180662	eng	This is a can.
9180672	eng	You could be next.
9180679	eng	Tom followed Mary's example.
9180768	eng	Hand me a clothespin.
9180769	eng	Give me a clothespin.
9180785	eng	There's no more beer.
9180787	eng	There's no more milk.
9180789	eng	There's no more butter.
9180791	eng	There's no more sugar.
9180792	eng	There's no sugar left.
9180794	eng	Those are my horses.
9180806	eng	Could you come today?
9180808	eng	Tom, leave it alone.
9180856	eng	Tom saw Mary dancing.
9180865	eng	Whose cat is this?
9180912	eng	You learn by doing.
9180917	eng	We learn by doing.
9180938	eng	You'd better stay away.
9180992	eng	You're being very selfish.
9180997	eng	Is that a turtle?
9181010	eng	I wished Tom luck.
9181017	eng	Who's Tom climbing with?
9181111	eng	Tom might believe you.
9181112	eng	The door is jammed.
9181234	eng	I need a priest.
9181332	eng	I recognized those people.
9181376	eng	Tom seems very confident.
9181407	eng	Do we need it?
9181426	eng	You can't beat us.
9181439	eng	My wallet is brown.
9181489	eng	Do they believe us?
9181503	eng	Tom never beats me.
9181512	eng	Send me Tom's address.
9181521	eng	He kissed her goodbye.
9181522	eng	Those are the best.
9181529	eng	I need the original.
9181533	eng	This is Tom's choice.
9181604	eng	Whose key is that?
9181637	eng	This is a hoe.
9181754	eng	This soup is awful.
9181758	eng	Tom played the fool.
9181774	eng	We had some trouble.
9181780	eng	Who will free me?
9181785	eng	Thank you for visiting.
9181843	eng	I'm Hungarian, and you?
9181885	eng	Corn is a cereal.
9181896	eng	She found something cheaper.
9181918	eng	He is feeling sick.
9181942	eng	It should be banned.
9182059	eng	Good children learn eagerly.
9182085	eng	I'm stirring my coffee.
9182090	eng	He blocked my account.
9182123	eng	He's a language purist.
9182145	eng	This lake is shallow.
9182157	eng	He needs to practice.
9182162	eng	He needs to practise.
9182207	eng	I will buy one.
9182289	eng	Why's Tom at home?
9182323	eng	Tom brushed his beard.
9182416	eng	This is white bread.
9182444	eng	What does he think?
9182488	eng	We're residents of Boston.
9182494	eng	We're engaging our engines.
9182505	eng	Will Tom appear tonight?
9182521	eng	Tom doesn't obey orders.
9182534	eng	This is goat cheese.
9182569	eng	This sport requires helmets.
9182591	eng	I'm not a bandwagoner.
9182609	eng	My feet are wet.
9182667	eng	The pipe is clogged.
9182708	eng	We're creators, not consumers.
9182713	eng	We'll see who wins.
9182721	eng	I'm glad nobody died.
9182736	eng	Murder is a crime.
9182746	eng	Don't scare Tom away.
9182792	eng	Can languages influence personality?
9182795	eng	So, are you coming?
9182837	eng	Why's Tom always absent?
9182848	eng	The floor is damp.
9182920	eng	I found your grandparents.
9182981	eng	See manual for instructions.
9182989	eng	Actually, Tom isn't married.
9182990	eng	The toilet is clean.
9182995	eng	Tom likes ghost stories.
9183019	eng	We're very good listeners.
9183058	eng	Tom was very smug.
9183059	eng	I find that absurd.
9183064	eng	The plan is ready.
9183076	eng	I like my in-laws.
9183077	eng	Tom gets up late.
9183079	eng	The lobby is empty.
9183103	eng	Don't let them leave.
9183105	eng	Tom doesn't eat celery.
9183107	eng	Try to impress Tom.
9183109	eng	That guy is crazy.
9183114	eng	Let Tom speak first.
9183121	eng	We'll always miss Tom.
9183123	eng	We missed our chance.
9183124	eng	The results were discouraging.
9183140	eng	Deal with Tom yourself.
9183154	eng	What rank is Tom?
9183157	eng	This isn't our station.
9183162	eng	The match is over.
9183167	eng	Where will Tom stay?
9183169	eng	They weren't with me.
9183177	eng	Tom heard someone coughing.
9183190	eng	The safe is open.
9183195	eng	We should stop here.
9183197	eng	Tom cleaned the beach.
9183206	eng	We won't walk there.
9183223	eng	You should rewrite this.
9183229	eng	All this is strange.
9183249	eng	Tom likes my friends.
9183252	eng	My bicycle is black.
9183255	eng	I hate washing dishes.
9183259	eng	We're a little disappointed.
9183262	eng	Whose keys are these?
9183271	eng	I never studied French.
9183274	eng	This cup is broken.
9183312	eng	Last winter was hard.
9183324	eng	I'll make breakfast today.
9183330	eng	Why did Tom fail?
9183362	eng	Losing weight isn't easy.
9183520	eng	Not everyone knows this.
9183544	eng	This is very moving.
9183567	eng	Are you going anyway?
9183573	eng	I'll buy more beer.
9183677	eng	That man is crazy.
9183992	eng	This is a mango.
9184039	eng	Nobody saw Tom fall.
9184047	eng	Tom emptied the container.
9184093	eng	One box is enough.
9184126	eng	Why didn't you vote?
9184133	eng	Tom often bakes cookies.
9184154	eng	This is apple juice.
9184356	eng	The bus was early.
9184494	eng	This is the paradox.
9184534	eng	That isn't Tom's voice.
9184639	eng	What's that key to?
9184672	eng	Give me your tongue.
9184711	eng	This is a nest.
9185024	eng	My French is awful.
9185205	eng	Tom works in accounting.
9185333	eng	Tom immigrated from Australia.
9185457	eng	Why's it so short?
9185566	eng	Is Mary really pregnant?
9185942	eng	Is that Tom's signature?
9185987	eng	The cat is hungry.
9186292	eng	I have no grandchildren.
9186374	eng	Tom blinked several times.
9186381	eng	I like classic cars.
9186401	eng	Stop staring at Tom.
9186416	eng	Propane is a gas.
9186735	eng	That won't be profitable.
9186829	eng	Tom's belt was unbuckled.
9186841	eng	Is this your boy?
9187013	eng	I like my brother.
9187378	eng	I was also offended.
9187406	eng	The wall is white.
9187472	eng	Possibly that's a mistake.
9187480	eng	I got dirty, too.
9187483	eng	Give Tom the phone.
9187489	eng	Our website is offline.
9187515	eng	I've met Tom's parents.
9187674	eng	Who's all this for?
9187684	eng	Call Tom right now.
9187693	eng	This is my boss.
9187865	eng	We tracked Tom down.
9187920	eng	The lamp is broken.
9187922	eng	Tom read the text.
9187932	eng	This meat is overcooked.
9187948	eng	Shouldn't we follow Tom?
9187965	eng	Was Tom ever late?
9187966	eng	I'm not expecting guests.
9188015	eng	This is the bathtub.
9188063	eng	We still need you.
9188097	eng	The trunk is full.
9188132	eng	This is even better.
9188139	eng	That sounds very flattering.
9188153	eng	I myself was confused.
9188158	eng	This couch is heavy.
9188175	eng	I play the ukulele.
9188194	eng	This parrot is old.
9188197	eng	My computer is borked.
9188199	eng	Tom won't forgive himself.
9188232	eng	What if I disagree?
9188243	eng	I'll pay for Tom.
9188246	eng	I cannot believe it!
9188258	eng	Mary's of German descent.
9188262	eng	This is good advice.
9188284	eng	It looks sick, Tom.
9188294	eng	I probably butchered that.
9188304	eng	I love the mask.
9188306	eng	It's absolutely not sustainable.
9188320	eng	We cleaned the room.
9188337	eng	Is this movie good?
9188341	eng	Things went pretty well.
9188351	eng	This box is huge.
9188376	eng	Give Tom this medicine.
9188392	eng	My dog is sick.
9188395	eng	Maybe we won't go.
9188400	eng	The baby is awake.
9188406	eng	Tom won hands down.
9188426	eng	I've tortured the prisoners.
9188432	eng	I bought a laptop.
9188436	eng	This is a mole.
9188437	eng	Nobody heard Tom scream.
9188438	eng	Tom sprayed the plants.
9188480	eng	I must've looked stupid.
9188483	eng	Tom moves quite often.
9188485	eng	This is my calling.
9188489	eng	Go keep Tom company.
9188503	eng	I trimmed my bangs.
9188505	eng	Everybody's health is important.
9188512	eng	The door is broken.
9188527	eng	Don't be so aggressive.
9188541	eng	This plane is huge.
9188543	eng	I can't deceive Tom.
9188545	eng	I'm always on duty.
9188554	eng	My hair is gray.
9188556	eng	My holiday starts tomorrow.
9188564	eng	I've been feeling stressed.
9188589	eng	I've almost persuaded Tom.
9188594	eng	This is a box.
9188642	eng	Don't go so fast.
9188644	eng	Get used to it.
9188695	eng	Everyone is at home.
9188709	eng	Tom still plays soccer.
9188785	eng	This is a pin.
9188849	eng	That money is mine.
9188852	eng	I don't like pepper.
9188859	eng	Do you like noodles?
9188866	eng	The lion goes roar.
9188870	eng	I learned English online.
9188876	eng	I'm a student teacher.
9188883	eng	Those shoes are mine.
9188896	eng	Doesn't it bother Tom?
9188905	eng	It's not midnight yet.
9188908	eng	Well, you've found it.
9188929	eng	I'm sorry, I overslept.
9188944	eng	The pools were drained.
9188957	eng	Mediterranean weather is mild.
9188991	eng	She runs very fast.
9189012	eng	Who wrote that text?
9189046	eng	They've moved the entrance.
9189054	eng	Send it to her.
9189055	eng	Send it to him.
9189062	eng	Say goodbye to Tom.
9189147	eng	They should go home.
9189151	eng	The managers are incompetent.
9189164	eng	Entry is still prohibited.
9189195	eng	Are you feeling well?
9189201	eng	They're friends of ours.
9189202	eng	Tom knocked Mary out.
9189205	eng	I enjoyed your speech.
9189206	eng	Welcome, I am Omid.
9189216	eng	Did Tom drink anything?
9189229	eng	She is drinking water.
9189230	eng	The girl drinks tea.
9189249	eng	Anything interesting happen lately?
9189284	eng	Be careful next time.
9189307	eng	I just took it.
9189312	eng	It lifts your spirits.
9189335	eng	Can we trust politicians?
9189336	eng	Can we believe politicians?
9189341	eng	This is lemon juice.
9189354	eng	Some jobs are face-to-face.
9189377	eng	I won't go anywhere.
9189378	eng	The orphan needs food.
9189389	eng	Are they too tight?
9189390	eng	Those shoes look uncomfortable.
9189401	eng	I'll cook dinner tonight.
9189473	eng	Discussions will be frequent.
9189489	eng	This is a banjo.
9189502	eng	The roads are empty.
9189582	eng	I like its fragrance.
9189615	eng	Please don't tell Mom!
9189728	eng	I didn't bite Tom.
9189753	eng	I'm tired of ironing.
9189895	eng	Spare me your stories.
9189899	eng	Wait. I'll find out.
9189900	eng	Spare me your excuses.
9189947	eng	That made Tom giggle.
9189958	eng	This one is worse.
9189981	eng	Neighbors help each other.
9189994	eng	Everyone has gone mad.
9190012	eng	It's simple; they're idiots.
9190030	eng	I play several instruments.
9190038	eng	Tom likes teaching French.
9190047	eng	Is this all true?
9190271	eng	We were pretty late.
9190285	eng	The milk is rancid.
9190297	eng	I drive the car.
9190315	eng	I love everything here.
9190324	eng	The dog attacked Tom.
9190450	eng	Have you kissed yet?
9190458	eng	Tom won't tell anybody.
9190474	eng	This rag is filthy.
9190561	eng	This is my mother's.
9190605	eng	What a curious fact!
9190610	eng	Tom is a coppersmith.
9190640	eng	I still regret it.
9190650	eng	This is a hat.
9190672	eng	Will you come again?
9190683	eng	I didn't beat Tom.
9190694	eng	Life is an exile.
9190715	eng	Your door was open.
9190740	eng	The rifle is loaded.
9190778	eng	I recognize those people.
9190789	eng	This is engine oil.
9190795	eng	Tom tried very hard.
9190844	eng	I brought my tools.
9190862	eng	Who came with Tom?
9190933	eng	Tom called three times.
9190943	eng	My hair is blond.
9190986	eng	We had good mentors.
9190996	eng	Tom muted his microphone.
9191395	eng	Tom deceived us all.
9191478	eng	I bought almost everything.
9191594	eng	This is very acidic.
9191678	eng	Is it raining there?
9191688	eng	Who's Tom sailing with?
9191705	eng	Well, did it help?
9191715	eng	Tom scanned the horizon.
9191744	eng	It's the crunchiest part.
9191759	eng	This car is small.
9191807	eng	These are no better.
9191811	eng	You're a jerk, Tom.
9191829	eng	This soup is salty.
9191889	eng	Who lives with Tom?
9191920	eng	Tom was too insistent.
9192112	eng	I hate onion soup.
9192168	eng	You're disturbing the neighbors.
9192183	eng	More time is needed.
9192185	eng	We've seen Tom recently.
9192190	eng	Leila lives in Yemen.
9192200	eng	That was an accident.
9192211	eng	Is this really true?
9192219	eng	I'm such a dork.
9192229	eng	Tom cleans the stable.
9192279	eng	Tom shot the deer.
9192280	eng	Is this our train?
9192325	eng	It's our turn soon.
9192350	eng	I couldn't kill anyone.
9192367	eng	This is too radical.
9192377	eng	My phone is charging.
9192481	eng	The safe is closed.
9192489	eng	Did they feed you?
9192498	eng	This is well water.
9192550	eng	Isn't Tom from here?
9192562	eng	I'd like that, too.
9192563	eng	The floor is wet.
9192574	eng	We ate for free.
9192581	eng	Whose dogs are these?
9192582	eng	Will Tom come here?
9192585	eng	This song is great.
9192591	eng	That car is empty.
9192608	eng	You caught my eye.
9192609	eng	God knows I tried.
9192615	eng	Take out your notebook.
9192627	eng	Gimme back my eraser.
9192632	eng	My reign is supreme.
9192644	eng	You sleep on that?
9192649	eng	Try refreshing the tab.
9192661	eng	This is a fan.
9192669	eng	This is peach juice.
9192676	eng	I prefer raw almonds.
9192686	eng	This is a fox.
9192691	eng	That's all we have.
9192697	eng	Math is very hard.
9192698	eng	Tom's phone is tapped.
9192706	eng	I'm a good citizen.
9192708	eng	Tom wouldn't calm down.
9192757	eng	Mum laid the table.
9192762	eng	Does Tom still teach?
9192771	eng	Your knife is rusty.
9192775	eng	She's still nattering on.
9192788	eng	Come live with us.
9192795	eng	I felt very bad.
9192823	eng	I keep losing things.
9192853	eng	Why's that so small?
9192866	eng	Are you a freemason?
9192976	eng	Take off your hats.
9192996	eng	It's making me gag.
9193025	eng	See what's on TV.
9193032	eng	What does Tom like?
9193040	eng	Tom showed his ID.
9193049	eng	Is this your doing?
9193077	eng	This is a cap.
9193087	eng	That's not a sentence.
9193088	eng	I'm reading a novel.
9193114	eng	This is our station.
9193159	eng	All babies are cute.
9193173	eng	Should we invite Tom?
9193198	eng	This can't be resold.
9193209	eng	Why don't you eat?
9193213	eng	Who organised the party?
9193214	eng	Who organised this party?
9193218	eng	Tom sent Mary messages.
9193258	eng	I'm about to start.
9193261	eng	Didn't Tom know anything?
9193266	eng	Well, I'm not going.
9193302	eng	I lost my virginity.
9193329	eng	You'll be stronger together.
9193330	eng	The legends are wrong.
9193338	eng	They stopped meeting regularly.
9193346	eng	Come to my place!
9193365	eng	Who took my briefcase?
9193395	eng	You were not ill.
9193439	eng	He'll play soccer tomorrow.
9193442	eng	There's no third chance.
9193448	eng	The temperature's very high.
9193450	eng	The fog's very dense.
9193452	eng	What's happened up ahead?
9193453	eng	School starts at eight-thirty.
9193458	eng	That's what they get.
9193459	eng	That's what they deserve.
9193460	eng	The car was wrecked.
9193473	eng	Winter solstice is coming.
9193477	eng	He'll write a letter.
9193484	eng	Because I deserve it.
9193490	eng	I'm sure they'll come.
9193491	eng	I began drinking beer.
9193502	eng	He'll sleep in prison.
9193513	eng	I'll take what's mine.
9193519	eng	We must be firm.
9193532	eng	Turn the music off.
9193541	eng	War - never again!
9193545	eng	We leave at dawn.
9193579	eng	Tom won't feel guilty.
9193622	eng	Tom was discharged today.
9193642	eng	Who'll you root for?
9193691	eng	I lost my dictionary.
9193805	eng	This is Tom's sketch.
9193819	eng	This isn't my cup.
9194095	eng	No one remembered Tom.
9194163	eng	Are you a newcomer?
9194176	eng	We're very old men.
9194193	eng	Tom didn't even call.
9194216	eng	I hate taking tests.
9194231	eng	There may be more.
9194363	eng	I didn't doubt you.
9194447	eng	Tom's nephew is famous.
9194454	eng	I'm taking psychology courses.
9194467	eng	Mary is a brunette.
9194477	eng	I'm an English teacher.
9194478	eng	I majored in Spanish.
9194487	eng	My Spanish is rusty.
9194504	eng	Get away from it.
9194520	eng	I must be allergic.
9194529	eng	That's not my objective.
9194553	eng	His prognosis is grim.
9194554	eng	It's healthy to play.
9194561	eng	He's such a flirt.
9194573	eng	Stop wasting time already.
9194591	eng	He left without paying.
9194600	eng	Maybe he has it.
9194604	eng	I lost my nerve.
9194609	eng	I'm a bit restless.
9194648	eng	Who's she? Your girlfriend?
9194653	eng	I always screw up.
9194657	eng	Preparing this is easy.
9194658	eng	Making this is easy.
9194671	eng	I haven't arrived yet.
9194690	eng	Is that one yours?
9194692	eng	I kissed Tom's neck.
9194697	eng	You have to cook.
9194700	eng	It's an old book.
9194723	eng	Tom quickened his pace.
9194741	eng	You started before Tom.
9194768	eng	We know your father.
9194873	eng	Where are the Alps?
9194874	eng	Tom looked pretty stupid.
9194880	eng	Let's visit Tom sometime.
9194951	eng	I've made great progress.
9194952	eng	Is Tom leaving soon?
9194968	eng	You're a strange individual.
9194969	eng	Seeing Tom, Mary smiled.
9194970	eng	Nobody likes this idea.
9194981	eng	Don't you watch TV?
9194989	eng	I clearly understood that.
9195006	eng	Do they sell rakes?
9195007	eng	Tom likes to gossip.
9195069	eng	I'm not drunk yet.
9195074	eng	We're friends with Tom.
9195088	eng	Can you handle this?
9195090	eng	Tom stifled a sneeze.
9195108	eng	I urgently need money.
9195114	eng	I miss your kisses.
9195132	eng	Shame you can't come.
9195135	eng	Tom's plan could fail.
9195167	eng	It was glorious weather.
9195169	eng	It was marvellous weather.
9195180	eng	Let's go play football.
9195199	eng	Dad's just got home.
9195202	eng	Dad's just arrived home.
9195223	eng	I'll carry your suitcase.
9195297	eng	You're taller than her.
9195298	eng	There's no third possibility.
9195300	eng	There's no third option.
9195302	eng	There's no third choice.
9195351	eng	Maybe you've just forgotten.
9195367	eng	That's actually very simple.
9195468	eng	We did do it.
9195518	eng	It's worth a go.
9195577	eng	Tom is a stutterer.
9195587	eng	People treat Tom unfairly.
9195597	eng	His report was accurate.
9195603	eng	How's my ad libbing?
9195633	eng	Well, I'm off now.
9195655	eng	I was almost there.
9195668	eng	I'm babysitting them today.
9195697	eng	This can't be fixed.
9195730	eng	Do you have plans?
9195801	eng	I'm waiting to speak.
9195893	eng	What a smart boy!
9195930	eng	Tom doesn't work anywhere.
9196146	eng	Tom's bag is full.
9196148	eng	I honestly think so.
9196149	eng	Is that Tom's handwriting?
9196179	eng	Mom, Tom pinched me.
9196485	eng	Muhammad is our prophet.
9196665	eng	What is radical Islam?
9196670	eng	He's around my age.
9196685	eng	I know you're careful.
9196778	eng	He was stark naked.
9196809	eng	It's so damn warm.
9196893	eng	Don't forget to call.
9196917	eng	Tom didn't really listen.
9196990	eng	We're out of rice.
9197133	eng	We won't come again.
9197172	eng	Is Tom ever late?
9197357	eng	The knife isn't sharpened.
9197424	eng	I like my godfather.
9197615	eng	Tom enjoys riding horses.
9197662	eng	I'll drop by tomorrow.
9197866	eng	We'll be living together.
9198046	eng	I'll call you Tom.
9198057	eng	Here, take a drink.
9198086	eng	Tom answered the call.
9198196	eng	Will you come back?
9198232	eng	Tom insulted the waitress.
9198319	eng	Tom passionately hugged Mary.
9198411	eng	Tom crawled towards me.
9198413	eng	Come, watch and laugh!
9198415	eng	I'll call you Monday.
9198425	eng	I refer to you.
9198462	eng	Tom finished his speech.
9198468	eng	The movie was romantic.
9198521	eng	It sounds very interesting.
9198539	eng	Let's go help Tom.
9198576	eng	Call me an idealist.
9198599	eng	Do you like mangoes?
9198610	eng	The queue was long.
9198611	eng	Where is my folder?
9198675	eng	Tom was completely surprised.
9198721	eng	These pants don't fit.
9198723	eng	Give Tom a hat.
9199028	eng	Keep the kids busy.
9199046	eng	What's with Tom today?
9199071	eng	No wonder Tom failed.
9199074	eng	I don't want soup.
9199079	eng	I've met Tom's friends.
9199092	eng	Could we meet today?
9199108	eng	Tom finished the cake.
9199118	eng	Did Tom notice it?
9199162	eng	Tom has cold feet.
9199203	eng	The rifle wasn't loaded.
9199214	eng	I almost dozed off.
9199261	eng	I like boiled eggs.
9199308	eng	It's not that much.
9199329	eng	Pour Tom some milk.
9199354	eng	Who's Tom eating with?
9199362	eng	Tom called us liars.
9199364	eng	Does Tom follow football?
9199365	eng	Can you water ski?
9199378	eng	I'll call on Monday.
9199392	eng	We often eat pizza.
9199401	eng	What's Tom interested in?
9199407	eng	You don't like beer?
9199410	eng	Don't you like beer?
9199414	eng	We need more bandages.
9199417	eng	I accepted Tom's invitation.
9199429	eng	I do love them.
9199448	eng	I need three copies.
9199454	eng	Don't be a sucker.
9199463	eng	Don't talk like that!
9199471	eng	This won't fit you.
9199481	eng	I like silver cars.
9199489	eng	I love being home.
9199535	eng	This time is mine.
9199548	eng	The leftovers went bad.
9199567	eng	Why is it illegal?
9199583	eng	Bathroom jokes. How mature.
9199587	eng	What should we discuss?
9199593	eng	What are my rights?
9199594	eng	You need a warrant.
9199596	eng	Show me the warrant.
9199599	eng	Tom briefly studied law.
9199613	eng	This plan will work.
9199619	eng	You should practise patience.
9199646	eng	Tom loves playing solitaire.
9199647	eng	The wood was silent.
9199648	eng	The woods were silent.
9199651	eng	The forest was silent.
9199687	eng	This may be iridium.
9199707	eng	The weather is wonderful.
9199709	eng	The weather is marvellous.
9199719	eng	Smoking is not permitted.
9199720	eng	She did the washing-up.
9199733	eng	The museum is interesting.
9199738	eng	She has stopped working.
9199753	eng	It can easily happen.
9199754	eng	It can happen easily.
9199772	eng	It was meant well.
9199777	eng	It was well intended.
9199781	eng	See? You're smiling again!
9199791	eng	Yesterday evening was nice.
9199793	eng	Last night was nice.
9199802	eng	Is the material breathable?
9199807	eng	The meeting was adjourned.
9199813	eng	That's not much consolation.
9199814	eng	That's not very consoling.
9199815	eng	His operation went well.
9199821	eng	It suddenly became dark.
9199875	eng	It's a gripping film.
9199877	eng	Lie in the sun.
9199880	eng	Please sing something else.
9199905	eng	Mind the oncoming traffic!
9199907	eng	Will Tom come today?
9199931	eng	It smells of roses.
9199933	eng	What've you been watching?
9199937	eng	It's not much use.
9199980	eng	They've suffered a defeat.
9199982	eng	They suffered a defeat.
9199994	eng	You'll soon notice it.
9200029	eng	Have they told him?
9200030	eng	Did they tell him?
9200040	eng	Are you whacked out?
9200041	eng	Are you tired out?
9200042	eng	Are you worn out?
9200049	eng	Do you need transport?
9200069	eng	It's an open-air event.
9200072	eng	Oh, let's forget it.
9200654	eng	He founded this school.
9200789	eng	He's not a soldier.
9200801	eng	Rhinos can attack people.
9200807	eng	Did Tom offend you?
9200816	eng	The match went out.
9200817	eng	What shall we cook?
9200833	eng	This passport has expired.
9200841	eng	Very well, thank you.
9200864	eng	Tom might be overwhelmed.
9200884	eng	The answer puzzled Tom.
9200908	eng	Last winter was mild.
9201012	eng	We're on the air.
9201015	eng	I want more juice.
9201067	eng	Buy something to eat.
9201068	eng	Tom can't keep quiet.
9201086	eng	I immediately regretted it.
9201105	eng	Tom, come out here.
9201283	eng	Tom had another accident.
9201323	eng	I didn't draw this.
9201507	eng	Tom ate a little.
9201625	eng	No one met us.
9201674	eng	Tom closed his umbrella.
9201725	eng	The walls are thick.
9201851	eng	This can't be washed.
9201858	eng	It's a provocative dance.
9201881	eng	Find a part-time job.
9201884	eng	Spend time in nature.
9201932	eng	Tom loves Mary's company.
9201988	eng	Wash behind your ears.
9202038	eng	I felt uncomfortable there.
9202105	eng	I pretended to cry.
9202308	eng	I only have one.
9202524	eng	Don't be silly, Tom.
9202582	eng	Tom's shoelaces were untied.
9202629	eng	I almost died there.
9202702	eng	This pear isn't ripe.
9202713	eng	We're very smart people.
9202759	eng	I've never smoked before.
9202771	eng	Now don't be upset.
9202779	eng	Tom goes by "he/him".
9202813	eng	Maybe Tom won't go.
9202837	eng	A dove symbolizes peace.
9202849	eng	Avoid taking unnecessary risks.
9202871	eng	He's of Irish descent.
9202886	eng	This table is here.
9202887	eng	Tom challenged the system.
9202947	eng	The fan won't stop.
9202966	eng	Sometimes I work holidays.
9202968	eng	We have two kidneys.
9202969	eng	It's a tricky road.
9203010	eng	We had an accident.
9203016	eng	Tom likes Asian girls.
9203054	eng	They've had a nightmare.
9203068	eng	He has amazing luck.
9203136	eng	I recognize that car.
9203167	eng	Tom writes me letters.
9203181	eng	I already know everything.
9203241	eng	Did you buy milk?
9203262	eng	Doesn't Tom trust us?
9203265	eng	It's been a year.
9203370	eng	Everyone's tired of Tom.
9203377	eng	We can't do better.
9203462	eng	Do ducks eat fish?
9203468	eng	It's not that small.
9203477	eng	I had noticed that.
9203480	eng	We must be patient.
9203503	eng	Who's Tom flirting with?
9203509	eng	We let Tom go.
9203520	eng	Go ahead without me.
9203535	eng	The waves were huge.
9203557	eng	We almost got away.
9203580	eng	I haven't broken anything.
9203582	eng	Give Tom some cookies.
9203584	eng	Tom didn't come in.
9203595	eng	We'll be open tomorrow.
9203604	eng	Tom rushed to help.
9203605	eng	I bet I win.
9203607	eng	Please log back in.
9203608	eng	Tom noticed Mary's excitement.
9203618	eng	Tom couldn't do this.
9203643	eng	Where are my notes?
9203656	eng	Everybody agreed with Tom.
9203662	eng	Now you can rest.
9203706	eng	I probably won't succeed.
9203716	eng	Who's your favorite superhero?
9203812	eng	Men love to brag.
9203854	eng	Tom asks stupid questions.
9203912	eng	Who lives below you?
9203961	eng	We're pretty good students.
9203979	eng	I like this smell.
9203991	eng	Let your hair down.
9204037	eng	Who lives underneath you?
9204095	eng	Where did Tom sit?
9204096	eng	The priest has come.
9204153	eng	Choose five learners now.
9204250	eng	Internet slang confuses me.
9204297	eng	Tom lost his nerve.
9204372	eng	Does your knee hurt?
9204383	eng	Where is Jabu’s cap?
9204453	eng	Yanni apologized to Skura.
9204503	eng	Tom knocked me out.
9204574	eng	We never found Tom.
9204664	eng	We'll have to leave.
9204666	eng	Tom wants jelly beans.
9204694	eng	I lost the ball.
9204720	eng	Don't drop those glasses.
9204761	eng	These children are obedient.
9204812	eng	Who's Tom swimming with?
9204815	eng	Have you seen mine?
9204884	eng	Tell them I'll come.
9204896	eng	Where is your conscience?
9204899	eng	We are ordinary mortals.
9204902	eng	Didn't you call Tom?
9205076	eng	Tom, you should go.
9205085	eng	I'm also from Australia.
9205394	eng	Tom welcomed us warmly.
9205452	eng	It was my debut.
9205484	eng	Tom probably did it.
9205589	eng	Who will Tom call?
9205606	eng	This was a poem.
9205837	eng	Tom was found alive.
9205908	eng	Are the measures legitimate?
9205987	eng	He'll play tennis tomorrow.
9206032	eng	This goes too far.
9206221	eng	What will we do?
9206359	eng	Was that a dragon?
9206365	eng	Human consciousness is evolving.
9206476	eng	Which language is it?
9206479	eng	I'm drinking beer now.
9206513	eng	Tom looks very confident.
9206541	eng	Everyone agreed with Tom.
9206554	eng	We're a bit tired.
9206591	eng	Mary is my spouse.
9206635	eng	I have good friends.
9206681	eng	Call the police now.
9206716	eng	Tom froze in horror.
9206833	eng	Show us some tricks.
9206885	eng	I don't need details.
9207075	eng	Tom came in last.
9207083	eng	Has anyone called Tom?
9207111	eng	I like being home.
9207128	eng	We'll get it back.
9207176	eng	Why did Tom abstain?
9207276	eng	Well, we warned you.
9207320	eng	Tom did it reluctantly.
9207350	eng	Please clear the table.
9207357	eng	Tom swatted the mosquito.
9207360	eng	Did you defeat Tom?
9207411	eng	Who's Tom singing with?
9207487	eng	Are you really alone?
9207490	eng	I don't like swearing.
9207491	eng	The dogs followed Tom.
9207492	eng	We never mentioned it.
9207499	eng	I know your daughter.
9207526	eng	We didn't say that.
9207542	eng	Tom will advise you.
9207555	eng	Will you help Tom?
9207559	eng	Why did you fight?
9207594	eng	Tom never skips school.
9207603	eng	There might be more.
9207619	eng	Tom has slimmed down.
9207652	eng	Hide under the table.
9207704	eng	I'll call you myself.
9207815	eng	This job was easy.
9207850	eng	I didn't immediately agree.
9207964	eng	I just want money.
9207976	eng	Tom sent Mary money.
9208000	eng	Put it somewhere else.
9208205	eng	The electricity is back.
9208333	eng	I have no cousins.
9208350	eng	Let's go right now.
9208355	eng	Yanni left the bathroom.
9208366	eng	Algiers is sound asleep.
9208435	eng	Tom really likes wine.
9208494	eng	I really like peonies.
9208531	eng	Tom looks about thirty.
9208543	eng	I'll try to help.
9208577	eng	My zip is broken.
9208615	eng	Who found my son?
9208630	eng	Tom often criticizes Mary.
9208642	eng	I broke my collarbone.
9208678	eng	You were still asleep.
9208770	eng	Tom walked me home.
9208856	eng	The spell was broken.
9209106	eng	Should we go out?
9209114	eng	Tom will come tonight.
9209384	eng	We went back home.
9209409	eng	Tom may be overwhelmed.
9209509	eng	Who are you anyway?
9209529	eng	She is with you.
9209543	eng	I'll tell them everything.
9209576	eng	Tom packed everything up.
9210087	eng	Which one was right?
9210101	eng	Tom admires Mary's work.
9210169	eng	It was Tom's choice.
9210218	eng	I'm not pressuring you.
9210227	eng	The traditions live on.
9210286	eng	I bet it's Tom.
9210290	eng	Tom wandered around town.
9210332	eng	Who needs my help?
9210341	eng	These socks are yours.
9210387	eng	I live in Ankara.
9210424	eng	Who's Tom dancing with?
9210577	eng	Do what Tom asks.
9210605	eng	I've solved the problem.
9210620	eng	Mary isn't my daughter.
9210688	eng	Tom passionately embraced Mary.
9210760	eng	Let's stay with Tom.
9210959	eng	These are Tom's slippers.
9210972	eng	Peach trees are deciduous.
9210981	eng	Tom will replace you.
9211011	eng	Most likely Tom forgot.
9211036	eng	We can start now.
9211105	eng	Apparently, Tom trusts me.
9211113	eng	I definitely need help.
9211117	eng	We didn't invite Tom.
9211140	eng	We got a signal.
9211153	eng	Tom's clothes were wet.
9211158	eng	It's too smoky here.
9211167	eng	What a crazy world!
9211179	eng	Is Tom very worried?
9211186	eng	I go there often.
9211198	eng	Do you feel nervous?
9211199	eng	Tom has kidney stones.

10904876	eng	That was the question.
10904879	eng	OK, that seems fair.
10904880	eng	Do you have allergies?
10904886	eng	I can't see clearly.
10904901	eng	Yes, that's not bad.
10904902	eng	It's that much junk.
10904903	eng	That's a novel idea.
10904904	eng	Don't tell the boys.
10904906	eng	Naming things is hard.
10904907	eng	Talk about the sunset.
10904909	eng	I'm quite all right.
10904917	eng	I'll get the tickets.

10908125	eng	Ziri ruined the moment.
10908133	eng	The trip proved difficult.
10908138	eng	I'm supposedly laid off.
10908139	eng	Quarrels soon arose again.
10908140	eng	Some were never completed.
10908148	eng	Together they solve cases.
10908150	eng	I can't please everybody.
10908152	eng	The toilet needed cleaning.
10908159	eng	Put down your guns.
10908163	eng	Did you change detergents?

10908833	eng	However, this is incorrect.
10908838	eng	Is it something infectious?
10908843	eng	The kangaroo hopped noisily.
10908846	eng	Please don't be concerned.
10908852	eng	The project was short-lived.
10908857	eng	I resent these implications.
10908868	eng	Other options are available.
10908875	eng	Both daughters were adopted.

10910571	eng	Ziri started walking away.
10910592	eng	Ziri's eyes welled up.
10910602	eng	Ziri ran off, grinning.
10910617	eng	Ziri suddenly barged in.
10910626	eng	Nobody really curtsies anymore.
10910646	eng	Ziri beat someone up.
10910659	eng	This is your duty.
10910660	eng	I hope Mary wins.
10910664	eng	His plan might fail.
10910665	eng	The situation was impossible.
10910806	eng	Tom had to disappear.
10911268	eng	This is a piano.
10911305	eng	Hand over your money.

10913020	eng	Ziri walked off angrily.
10913022	eng	That pattern hasn't changed.
10913023	eng	That'll be a disappointment.
10913029	eng	Ziri walked away quickly.
10913052	eng	Sodium hydroxide is corrosive.
10913073	eng	Ziri's anger calmed down.
10913115	eng	I felt very cold.
10913117	eng	It's just stopped raining.
10913123	eng	It's also remarkably accessible.

10923389	eng	It is a necessity.
10923390	eng	It's paid off, too.
10923459	eng	There weren't any survivors.
10923463	eng	Ziri silently walked away.

11124099	eng	Maybe you're right, Mary.
11124101	eng	Don't worry about us!
11124109	eng	No, he's not there.
11124110	eng	No, he's not here.

11127212	eng	Tom got that job.
11127222	eng	Tom made wise choices.
11127225	eng	Thank you for checking.
11127244	eng	Tom quickly backed away.

11134069	eng	My coat has pockets.
11134145	eng	He didn't read it.
11134151	eng	I lent him money.
11134158	eng	I'll bring some water.
11134159	eng	I'll get some water.
11134221	eng	This is for anyone.

11134656	eng	Tom quickly walked away.
11134664	eng	Which tap is dripping?
11134678	eng	It's getting dark earlier.
11134683	eng	I'm lacking some practice.
11134686	eng	He hasn't finished yet.

11134855	eng	My sons love animals.
11135008	eng	Their car's over there.
11135009	eng	Tom blushed with shame.
11135010	eng	Tom watered his roses.

11136501	eng	Where's the men's department?
11136575	eng	I like watching sunsets.
11136619	eng	Everyone knows except you.
11136620	eng	The door was blocked.

11140373	eng	This book is damaged.
11140379	eng	He denies any participation.
11140392	eng	Turn on your headlamps!
11140420	eng	I admitted my mistakes.

12091537	eng	Welcome to the office.
12091589	eng	What a charming dress!
12091617	eng	Welcome to my neighborhood.
12091637	eng	How you have grown!
12091648	eng	That sounds so evil.
12091651	eng	Just do it further.
12091875	eng	Tom has a weapon.
12091897	eng	You could get divorced.
12091937	eng	Mistakes have been made.
12091977	eng	Tom was shouting instructions.
12092014	eng	Did you get ketchup?
12092016	eng	Potatoes are so versatile.
12092021	eng	They'll be here later.
12092166	eng	Have Tom call us.
12092184	eng	Run for your life.
12092214	eng	There's still a pandemic.
12092228	eng	I had the halibut.
12092311	eng	Tom could get grounded.
12092314	eng	Clean all the cutlery.
12092374	eng	Wait there for Tom.
12092471	eng	What a rotten day!
12092505	eng	Tom hurt my leg.
12092569	eng	What a cute skirt!
12092608	eng	You're a strong woman.
12092609	eng	The bees are buzzing.
12092630	eng	What a great title!
12092768	eng	Where are your mittens?
12092791	eng	Polo was my game.
12092822	eng	Tom looks very strong.
12092824	eng	Are your suitcases locked?
12092838	eng	I had a C-section.
12092883	eng	Are you all Canadians?
12092895	eng	Welcome to our hotel.
12092899	eng	Did they eat it?
12093049	eng	Tom prefers to wait.
12093051	eng	You sound rather jaded.
12093065	eng	Tom has planned something.
12093158	eng	Nobody heard a thing.
12093216	eng	We've been fooling ourselves.
12093327	eng	Tom got to me.
12093555	eng	Why are we lingering?
12093580	eng	Check in with Tom.
12093692	eng	He doesn't really work.
12093702	eng	You sound really sleepy.
12093746	eng	I go by Tom.
12093831	eng	It's more comfortable outside.
12093849	eng	There were bicycles everywhere.
12093961	eng	It's not the weekend.
12094101	eng	Nobody hid anything there.
12094119	eng	That might be Tom.
12094144	eng	Ask Tom about Mary.
12094198	eng	Enter our humble dwelling.
12094419	eng	The video is paused.
12094424	eng	I heard two gunshots.
12094454	eng	I was already asleep.
12094553	eng	This was very unpredictable.
12094572	eng	You sound really lonely.
12094608	eng	Where is Tom, actually?
12094626	eng	Tom was a nomad.
12094702	eng	Tom might've left earlier.
12094703	eng	Tom probably left earlier.
12094704	eng	Maybe Tom left earlier.
12094731	eng	That sounds made up.
12094749	eng	Are you a Catholic?
12094751	eng	I found three chairs.
12094752	eng	Officially, this never happened.
12094756	eng	Tom is our neighbour.
12094757	eng	We're meeting Tom tomorrow.
12094758	eng	We haven't got to.
12094759	eng	We don't need to.

12094768	eng	You did the washing-up.
12094769	eng	You needn't phone me.
12094770	eng	You needn't ring me.
12094777	eng	I wasn't too tired.
12094779	eng	I'm picturing it now.
12094789	eng	Tom might come back.
12094792	eng	Tom is learning self-defence.
12094811	eng	Who'll win this time?
12094884	eng	Everyone is helping Tom.
12094885	eng	I read your novel.
12094896	eng	Tom took no chances.
12094913	eng	The media creates fear.
12094998	eng	Which is more important?
12095009	eng	Why were you fighting?

12095213	eng	Have I misunderstood something?
12095292	eng	Tom already told us.
12095363	eng	I fractured my wrist.
12095383	eng	Did you come together?
12095390	eng	Welcome to initiation day.
12095407	eng	I can get one.
12095455	eng	No one knows anyone.
12095458	eng	And there was light.
12095497	eng	Turn the A/C on.
12095505	eng	Maybe I'm a genius.
12095573	eng	Her dick is thick.
12095660	eng	This came from Tom.
12095682	eng	They'll get here later.
12095683	eng	They will arrive later.
12095886	eng	You could get expelled.

12096403	eng	Mary had twins yesterday.
12096430	eng	You're nothing like Tom.
12096433	eng	I ate a bit.
12096482	eng	Tom gave me these.
12096485	eng	We have a victor.
12096569	eng	Lynn runs very fast.

12097670	eng	This piano is unplayable.
12097957	eng	Did Tom take part?
12097972	eng	Accept my humble apologies.

12098441	eng	Were my calculations accurate?
12098442	eng	Are my calculations accurate?

12098719	eng	You sound really confident.
12098813	eng	You're a scary woman.
12098887	eng	Why are you fighting?
12098894	eng	That's an attractive proposition.
12099034	eng	Tom has relapsed again.

12099071	eng	Didn't you find him?
12099230	eng	She is the problem.
12099231	eng	He is the problem.
12099243	eng	Would Tom hurt me?
12099283	eng	Children belong to themselves.

12099901	eng	Which kid did this?
12099921	eng	Tom's marriage is rocky.
12099922	eng	What a stupid decision!
12099950	eng	He ran into me.
12099974	eng	Have I missed supper?

12101445	eng	I was not honest.
12101468	eng	Are your eyes blue?
12101551	eng	Tom should like that.
12101592	eng	Hezbollah has long-range missiles.

12133752	eng	Tom hurt his foot.
12133872	eng	What a handsome boy!
12133878	eng	What if Tom failed?
12133900	eng	Tom has embarrassed himself.
12133999	eng	The probability is low.
12134039	eng	One day, we'll understand.
12134040	eng	We'll understand one day.

12135560	eng	How much are carrots?
12135563	eng	Let's go help him!
12135571	eng	Whose tomb is this?

12137568	eng	Take us straight there.
12137597	eng	Will Tom be staying?

12140597	eng	Hopefully I'm not snoring.
12140688	eng	The pain terrifies me.
12140705	eng	Tom has been erratic.
12140808	eng	I really want Tom.
12140852	eng	You smell like garlic.
12140853	eng	You smell like bananas.
12140907	eng	Nobody helps anybody here.
12140914	eng	Did someone say Tom?
12140940	eng	He has countless books.
12141070	eng	I recognised the name.
12141096	eng	Mothers are often unappreciated.
12141108	eng	You mustn't say that.

12141842	eng	I called the repairman.
12141843	eng	Are you the repairman?
12142029	eng	What a dreadful evening!
12142134	eng	Cookie loves being scratched.
12142223	eng	I responded with pleasure.
12142297	eng	Tom bought me these.
12142376	eng	We were seen together.
12142545	eng	Tomorrow could be worse.
12142560	eng	Did you doze off?
12142567	eng	Vampires are not eternal.
12142570	eng	Show us your scar.
12142592	eng	They heard their call.
12142598	eng	You're jealous, I think.

12142614	eng	Will Tom be blamed?
12142650	eng	Mix me a drink.
12142676	eng	I told you everything.
12142681	eng	Get back here immediately.

12143008	eng	Are your teachers strict?
12143009	eng	Is your teacher strict?

12143078	eng	He's not your enemy.
12143080	eng	She's not your enemy.
12143097	eng	You sound pretty certain.
12143142	eng	I nearly poisoned myself.
12143166	eng	Tom always seems miserable.
12143215	eng	What a bizarre situation!
12143232	eng	Tom hurt many people.
12143370	eng	She liked the wine.

12143499	eng	Sugar makes me sick.
12143544	eng	I drink white wine.
12143546	eng	It's not his fault.
12143559	eng	I drank his wine.
12143592	eng	I like sweet wines.
12143610	eng	Tom just fired me.
12143713	eng	Did it bother Tom?
12143747	eng	The grownups are sleeping.
12143749	eng	It's Friday; I'm done.
12143750	eng	This is for grownups.

12143885	eng	You sound very serious.
12143932	eng	I can go back.
12143989	eng	Tom hurt his ankle.
12143990	eng	What a colossal mistake!
12144120	eng	Tom is actually OK.
12144121	eng	Are you all brave?

12144541	eng	I love Tom dearly.
12144650	eng	Yuck! That looks awful!
12144672	eng	You are completely nuts!
12144689	eng	Did someone mention dancing?
12144694	eng	Leave them alone, Tom.
12144731	eng	This dog is insane.
12144827	eng	I'm a humble man.
12144874	eng	Why do I bother?
12144939	eng	What a cunning man!
12145079	eng	Tom was turning blue.
12145443	eng	I bet on it.
12145601	eng	Tom spoke about you.
12145967	eng	Here is his son.
12146243	eng	No one believes us.

12147065	eng	Will you accept me?
12147095	eng	Accidents hurt us all.
12147136	eng	They both got arrested.
12147299	eng	Nobody will be there.
12147458	eng	Cats like cardboard boxes.
12147567	eng	Welcome to the squad.
12147655	eng	This is really enough.
12147708	eng	We will warn him.
12147735	eng	Nobody can fix this.
12147863	eng	I've already paged Tom.
12147874	eng	Just open the can.
12148028	eng	You don't deserve that.
12148032	eng	You don't deserve me.
12148038	eng	Did Tom scold you?
12148045	eng	I had a break.
12148085	eng	Nobody came to visit.
12148097	eng	Tom did it poorly.
12148132	eng	It’s not obvious, actually.

12149059	eng	What are your dreams?
12149070	eng	Your father abandoned you.
12149103	eng	What is a community?
12149128	eng	Those people need us.
12149136	eng	What makes you comfortable?
12149137	eng	What brings you comfort?

12149385	eng	Tom continued speaking French.
12149464	eng	Are you already packing?
12149474	eng	What a delicious smell!
12149477	eng	Call anybody you want.
12149484	eng	Tom is emotionally unstable.

12150121	eng	Tom skipped a sentence.
12150134	eng	Mary is not pretty.
12150269	eng	Nowhere is safe anymore.
12150303	eng	Dr. Jackson will assist.
12150373	eng	What a ghastly idea!
12150428	eng	Tom left us something.
12150626	eng	Tell us about Australia.
12150633	eng	People recover from trauma.
12150657	eng	Tom lives right upstairs.
12150860	eng	We might lose Tom.
12150861	eng	Give back to others.
12150888	eng	Did you contact Tom?
12150903	eng	I found that exhilarating.

12169908	eng	Your parakeet has escaped.
12170000	eng	Let me apologize again.
12170382	eng	This is a banana.
12170423	eng	Tom has started kindergarten.
12170459	eng	Who is sitting there?
12170468	eng	Have some pie, please.
12170471	eng	Thomas was in love.
12170475	eng	She is walking silently.
12170479	eng	What's that street called?
12170482	eng	She is so funny.
12170488	eng	I like to debate.
12170492	eng	Surely that's not possible.
12170493	eng	Surely that's not acceptable.
12170514	eng	Can you understand it?
12170523	eng	We are counting down.
12170526	eng	I drank some tequila.
12170527	eng	I had some tequila.
12170534	eng	Keep me posted, Tom.
12170540	eng	He snores every night.
12170553	eng	That really is impressive!
12170554	eng	We're on an island.
12170558	eng	It reeks in here!
12170564	eng	They're glued on tight.
12170571	eng	Now forget about that!
12170572	eng	He is very clumsy.
12170574	eng	Damn it, it failed.
12170578	eng	I found your purse.
12170582	eng	You are very healthy.
12170583	eng	I'll take her there.
12170584	eng	I'm taking her there.
12170604	eng	It's just for decoration.
12170607	eng	I misjudged the distance.
12170611	eng	He's in the lead.
12170613	eng	There can be confusion.
12170624	eng	Tom stole my knife.
12170696	eng	Nobody lets me talk.
12170698	eng	We need more brandy.
12170721	eng	Accidents can happen anytime.
12170744	eng	Have you brought presents?
12170774	eng	Welcome to my sanctuary.
12170788	eng	What a charming lady!
12170854	eng	What a cool camera!
12170858	eng	Does Tom like seafood?
12170865	eng	Tom nicked my knife.
12170875	eng	Tom was really wonderful.
12170876	eng	You're scaring the children.
12170920	eng	Maybe Tom bought it.
12170926	eng	Rest is very important.
12171288	eng	Maria's back is good.
12171764	eng	Mobilization has already begun.
12171766	eng	Why are you screaming?
12171767	eng	Nobody holds you responsible.
12171771	eng	Tom refused to comply.
12171788	eng	You sound very happy.
12171802	eng	Tom flipped out completely.
12171854	eng	Tom almost drowned here.
12171972	eng	VAR is ruining football.
12171979	eng	The world is round.
12172003	eng	She's an interesting person.

12172025	eng	Your strategy didn't work.
12172026	eng	Their strategy didn't work.
12172027	eng	Her strategy didn't work.
12172028	eng	You've been gathering wood.
12172051	eng	It's no use waiting.
12172052	eng	There's no point waiting.
12172064	eng	Only you want it.
12172095	eng	Have you been eavesdropping?
12172096	eng	You are expressly disinvited.
12172098	eng	That's a birch tree.
12172101	eng	What a weird bloke!
12172102	eng	What a strange bloke!
12172103	eng	What an odd feller!
12172104	eng	How is that spelt?
12172106	eng	How is it spelt?
12172125	eng	I hope he's well.
12172127	eng	Call child protection services.
12172144	eng	Welcome to our circle.

12173057	eng	Problems keep popping up.
12173097	eng	Solve your own problems.
12173112	eng	Some problems have arisen.
12173137	eng	What caused the problems?
12173168	eng	That problem was solved.

12175534	eng	Tom drove home drunk.
12175571	eng	Will you stop nagging?
12175898	eng	Give him some food.

12175921	eng	The gazebo has lights.
12176078	eng	Dinosaurs had big teeth.
12176191	eng	I can hear voices.
12176206	eng	The engine has stopped.
12176230	eng	It's done by machine.
12176236	eng	She unpacked the doll.
12176257	eng	Have you invited Tom?
12176302	eng	I'll ring the bell.
12176901	eng	What a terrible idea!
12176904	eng	Have you informed Tom?
12176905	eng	Do you have bagels?
12176906	eng	I play the banjo.
12176908	eng	Sing a bit louder.

12177438	eng	Everyone voted in favour.
12177445	eng	Have you been practising?
12177461	eng	Her hair is brown.

12177522	eng	Stop it. It's annoying!
12177584	eng	You can enter now.
12177591	eng	Add pepper to it.
12177603	eng	He went there alone.
12177605	eng	Beards are very trendy.
12177644	eng	Have you tried apologizing?
12177651	eng	Have fun with Tom.
12177711	eng	Did someone mention pizza?
12177910	eng	Put the knife down.
12177944	eng	Tom has an announcement.
12178526	eng	I heard from home.

12178757	eng	Have you been lonely?
12178801	eng	What a comfortable couch!
12178918	eng	It's a short sentence.
12178964	eng	What a fantastic audience!
12178984	eng	Tom no longer smokes.

12180341	eng	Tom seems really lonely.
12180445	eng	Did you insult Tom?
12180450	eng	I met your wife.
12180570	eng	My name is Yoke.
12180618	eng	Is that a number?
12180646	eng	This is an example.
12180695	eng	These are ridiculous stories.
12180700	eng	It wasn't growing anymore.
12180702	eng	He stopped growing up.
12180710	eng	Your budgerigar has escaped.
12180711	eng	Your budgie has escaped.
12180755	eng	Don't stop. Keep moving.
12180756	eng	Don't stop. Keep going.
12180767	eng	They should've foreseen this.
12180768	eng	They should've foreseen it.
12180769	eng	They should've anticipated that.
12180788	eng	Tom will visit Mary.
12180792	eng	Welcome to my studio.
12180793	eng	The divorce was complicated.
12180794	eng	That plan sounds crazy.
12180803	eng	It'll be no picnic.
12180812	eng	I found your wallet.
12180834	eng	It's an isolated case.
12180835	eng	Does anyone need silverware?
12180839	eng	Was Tom going home?
12180853	eng	Give Tom a buck.
12180914	eng	This isn't her handwriting.
12180916	eng	That's not her handwriting.
12180917	eng	That isn't her handwriting.
12180921	eng	Life is different there.
12180928	eng	I played the tuba.
12180933	eng	I found something important.
12180948	eng	Have you accomplished anything?
12180949	eng	That could get annoying.
12180950	eng	It could get annoying.
12180965	eng	Have you tried negotiating?
12180991	eng	Has Tom written you?
12180996	eng	Have you danced professionally?
12181023	eng	I saw a monkey.
12181024	eng	Bring the mike here.
12181026	eng	Tom wants me here.
12181029	eng	My parents are missionaries.
12181031	eng	I've found another solution.
12181104	eng	I am a bird.
12181487	eng	I saw an optometrist.
12181584	eng	What did she find?
12181633	eng	Who will tell Tom?
12181910	eng	Give Tom our love.
12182380	eng	I brought some honey.
12182390	eng	Have you ordered anything?
12182391	eng	Tom, is it you?
12182395	eng	I watched your rehearsal.
12182396	eng	I found something beautiful.
12182405	eng	Am I a boor?

12182451	eng	I saw you jogging.
12182458	eng	Let's write it down.
12182460	eng	Introduce them to me.
12182548	eng	I can hear OK.
12182573	eng	That was really impressive.
12182583	eng	I saw your sketches.
12182640	eng	What a funny hairdo!
12182641	eng	I still use that.
12182789	eng	Give me the box.
12182790	eng	Butterflies are winged insects.
12182792	eng	Leave it all behind.
12182861	eng	That speed is insane.
12182868	eng	That's the salt cellar.
12182937	eng	Who is your therapist?
12183203	eng	Are your parents sleeping?
12183206	eng	How's your business doing?
12183320	eng	Let me ask Tom.
12183329	eng	Are you all safe?
12183433	eng	Tom is our accountant.
12183518	eng	They don't sell that.
12183521	eng	I'm going there, too.
12183550	eng	Go sweep the floor!
12183605	eng	Are you Tom's client?
12183694	eng	They suppressed all resistance.
12183696	eng	She crushed the box.
12183705	eng	You are truly talented.
12183706	eng	Ziri is extremely talented.
12183722	eng	Do you have lice?
12183744	eng	Can you introduce yourself?
12183748	eng	I'm fixing the house.
12183749	eng	I've got a house.
12183757	eng	Let's end the discussion.
12183839	eng	He was extremely thin.

12183854	eng	Mary plucks her eyebrows.
12183856	eng	We bought her car.
12183857	eng	Your eyebrows are pretty.
12183971	eng	Tom disappeared weeks ago.
12184154	eng	Doesn't he eat dinner?
12184203	eng	Cross over the bridge.
12184215	eng	Nobody can change that.
12184267	eng	Tom kissed the photo.
12184271	eng	I can't sit up.
12184362	eng	Who cooked your dinner?
12184365	eng	Welcome to my mansion.
12184375	eng	What a disrespectful man!
12184386	eng	You're blocking the road.
12184395	eng	This is my workroom.
12184405	eng	Tom was my coach.
12184412	eng	Have you been quarreling?
12184415	eng	You sound upset now.
12184464	eng	What a depressing place!
12184468	eng	Tom didn't hug Mary.
12184500	eng	Welcome to our bakery.
12184516	eng	We crossed a drawbridge.
12184522	eng	I only know Tom.
12184548	eng	Have you graduated already?
12184617	eng	I washed Tom's clothes.
12184623	eng	I saw Tom doodling.
12184625	eng	Do you have anemia?
12184626	eng	Has everyone met Tom?
12184630	eng	Tom is an organizer.
12184640	eng	Add whatever you like.

12184753	eng	Welcome to our group.
12185178	eng	What are you collecting?
12185195	eng	Does your fur itch?
12185214	eng	Bob saw her again.
12185226	eng	Tom crushed the worm.
12185227	eng	It was completely crushed.
12185384	eng	I opened Tom's eyes.
12185478	eng	It's no mere coincidence.
12185557	eng	Send her a message.
12185687	eng	I saw you dancing.
12185688	eng	Tom smiled with relief.
12185946	eng	What a spoiled brat!
12185960	eng	Tom has drugged everybody.
12185962	eng	I found this outside.
12186090	eng	We're speaking with Mary.
12186126	eng	Who's your big sister?
12186139	eng	I haven't been dissatisfied.
12186278	eng	What a horrid place!
12186284	eng	I have an MBA.
12186306	eng	Tom was a punk.
12186358	eng	Tom has made millions.
12186362	eng	We'll be meeting downstairs.
12186451	eng	Tom is a villain.
12186537	eng	I need a brandy.
12186542	eng	That was a trap.
12186666	eng	You should be frank.
12186761	eng	Do we have money?
12186770	eng	I met him again.
12186778	eng	"Got it?" "I don't."
12186783	eng	Now you guys know.
12186784	eng	We were fixing it.
12186823	eng	We've suffered a setback.
12186925	eng	The experimental drug worked.
12186935	eng	Was he kicked out?
12186957	eng	You sound very cheerful.
12186990	eng	What a ghastly smell!
12186993	eng	Did you buy detergent?

12187108	eng	The accommodation is reserved.
12187115	eng	Yes, hello? Matsui here.
12187296	eng	What a cunning plan!
12187339	eng	Life has united us.
12187397	eng	I should be frank.
12187398	eng	What a fun idea!
12187401	eng	It didn't cost anything.
12187562	eng	It's twenty after ten.
12187569	eng	I was weighing everything.
12187572	eng	She isn't my wife.
12187590	eng	Nobody will see us.
12187595	eng	Did you behave yourselves?
12187596	eng	Did you behave yourself?
12187598	eng	The experimental antidepressant worked.
12187603	eng	Tom is extremely handsome.
12187739	eng	Have you said goodbye?
12187777	eng	Have you sold everything?
12187780	eng	Tom is the champ.
12187781	eng	Look at that chair.
12187786	eng	Tom could help out.
12187792	eng	I found the culprit.
12187798	eng	Look what Tom did.
12187802	eng	You should've written me.
12187806	eng	That was a scam.
12187811	eng	What a rookie mistake!
12187824	eng	Have you experienced loneliness?
12187828	eng	Keep whatever you want.
12187831	eng	Tom was having trouble.
12187837	eng	I can go on.
12187841	eng	Have you been meditating?
12187850	eng	I found your ring.

12187859	eng	Put the hatchet down.
12187866	eng	Which you is Tom?
12187899	eng	Is your daddy home?
12187920	eng	I saw your trial.
12187958	eng	We crossed the harbor.
12187964	eng	Nobody ever believes Tom.
12187973	eng	What a jealous man!
12187978	eng	Absolute secrecy is paramount.
12187994	eng	Tom is a storyteller.
12188005	eng	Hide behind that pillar.
12188031	eng	I found something similar.
12188034	eng	I need Tom's advice.
12188044	eng	Which one is heavier?
12188053	eng	I saw your resume.
12188057	eng	Tom may hear us.
12188059	eng	Are you all sick?
12188067	eng	Did you buy avocados?
12188069	eng	Obviously, Tom was wrong.
12188257	eng	This message is false.
12188263	eng	She shot the bear.
12188276	eng	There's a scientific explanation.
12188283	eng	Obviously, Tom is wrong.
12188301	eng	My sister is Christian.
12188328	eng	Politics makes us enemies.
12188340	eng	The car moved forward.
12188343	eng	Their situation was hopeless.
12188357	eng	I liked those places.
12188366	eng	She's dying of thirst.
12188642	eng	They'll buy a house.
12188700	eng	He's not my boss.
12188705	eng	My boss is inept.
12188725	eng	You can get better.
12188727	eng	People are very resilient.
12188867	eng	I could see Tom.
12188868	eng	Was I too impatient?
12189164	eng	We can talk here.
12189222	eng	The groupthink is incredible.
12189290	eng	How stupid was I!
12189299	eng	Why isn't Tom talking?
12189300	eng	Why doesn't Tom speak?
12189303	eng	Do you guys work?
12189305	eng	Are you guys working?
12189311	eng	Let's listen some more!
12189423	eng	These men are Cambodian.
12189425	eng	I've lived in Cambodia.
12189484	eng	That wasn't about anything.
12189488	eng	Will there be cats?
12189491	eng	Should we make challah?
12189514	eng	It's thirteen minutes long.
12189610	eng	Hate speech incites lynchings.
12189650	eng	His eye was swollen.
12189736	eng	Welcome to this town.

12205193	eng	Tom received a voicemail.
12205197	eng	What a pathetic loser!
12205298	eng	Everyone dies one day.
12205304	eng	I'm thirsty for knowledge.
12205344	eng	Did you bring champagne?
12205345	eng	We can never surrender.
12205357	eng	How careful is Tom?
12205445	eng	The door opened wide.
12205454	eng	He recognizes that door.
12205464	eng	The door stayed closed.
12205499	eng	I wore a shirt.
12205510	eng	She is getting ready.
12205515	eng	Are you all cozy?
12205517	eng	Hide in the garage.
12205521	eng	We'll wait with Tom.
12205528	eng	He's behind the door.
12205575	eng	Have you called home?
12205599	eng	Could you get Tom?
12205606	eng	I achieved the goal.
12205607	eng	I reached the goal.
12205608	eng	I've reached the goal.
12205615	eng	Tom would never approve.
12205631	eng	She walked very cautiously.
12205664	eng	I've always been frank.
12205680	eng	Which tent is yours?
12205707	eng	I really appreciate Tom.
12205733	eng	What a funny child!
12205738	eng	A fly can fly.
12205835	eng	Tom quarrelled with Mary.
12206058	eng	I saw you waiting.
12206215	eng	Love is the cure.
12206238	eng	Have you started running?
12206295	eng	You sound very sincere.
12206299	eng	Is someone else here?
12206445	eng	They left for home.
12206475	eng	I met Tom, too.
12206477	eng	You're my last hope.
12206675	eng	I know Tom Jackson.
12206677	eng	Did you achieve anything?
12206806	eng	Have you contacted Tom?
12206810	eng	We'll all go there.
12206834	eng	Have you quit smoking?
12206835	eng	I saw you laughing.
12206901	eng	Did you check downstairs?
12206905	eng	I saw you hesitating.
12206908	eng	That was Tom's assistant.
12206986	eng	Our country is unique.
12206994	eng	He constantly forgets everything.
12207031	eng	I found something interesting.
12207038	eng	The later, the better.
12207039	eng	I have something better.
12207056	eng	What a snobby girl!
12207070	eng	Tom built this restaurant.
12207075	eng	I found the bug.
12207135	eng	Let's mess with Tom.
12207145	eng	Tom was the victor.
12207154	eng	He killed my dreams.
12207238	eng	You sound stressed out.
12207241	eng	Was Tom expecting anybody?
12207244	eng	I feel completely disoriented.
12207245	eng	I bet you're happy.
12207250	eng	The war is raging.
12207264	eng	That is pure coincidence.
12207274	eng	You are not mine.
12207362	eng	I saw the robber.
12207426	eng	What a silly idea!
12207529	eng	I saw the shooting.
12207540	eng	Did they forgive him?
12207787	eng	Is Tom still homeless?
12207899	eng	Is this ukulele yours?
12207904	eng	Be home by three.
12207912	eng	She felt left out.
12207936	eng	We postponed the wedding.
12208106	eng	Stay by the shore.
12208219	eng	I had everybody fooled.
12208264	eng	The city was besieged.
12208285	eng	Have you eaten supper?
12208294	eng	I saw Tom's scars.
12208299	eng	I'm no ordinary woman.
12208303	eng	This bridge is concrete.
12208356	eng	We've postponed the wedding.
12208367	eng	I thought about this.
12208496	eng	Are there any problems?
12208507	eng	Was Mr. Jackson strict?
12208523	eng	Did you arrive early?
12208528	eng	Tom cuts down trees.
12208529	eng	Who knows this place?
12208540	eng	He saw a woman.
12208541	eng	She saw a woman.
12208549	eng	He never watches TV.
12208553	eng	This is all yours.
12208559	eng	This stew is delicious.
12208569	eng	This doesn't concern her.
12208570	eng	This doesn't concern them.
12208601	eng	Act like everybody else.
12208603	eng	Have you been unwell?
12208609	eng	Was Tom very angry?
12208610	eng	Have you had chickenpox?
12208634	eng	You're all wonderful people.
12208638	eng	Tom is splitting firewood.
12208673	eng	I saw you flinch.
12208683	eng	Nobody can hear us.
12208684	eng	Tom is next door.
12208768	eng	What a busy schedule!
12208769	eng	I ate three bagels.
12208806	eng	Good work takes time.
12208817	eng	Calm down. Don't panic.
12208868	eng	What? Is that all?
12208876	eng	This photomontage is hilarious.
12208916	eng	Use both your hands.
12208959	eng	He climbed the fence.
12209003	eng	Bring me some food.
12209160	eng	Are you all women?
12209165	eng	I found something good.
12209169	eng	Nobody could stop me.
12209257	eng	You can use anything.
12209266	eng	Did you buy candy?
12209286	eng	Her work was censored.
12209287	eng	His work was censored.
12209290	eng	Allah knows my heart.
12209298	eng	Why was he silent?
12209299	eng	Why was she silent?
12209408	eng	I found a weapon.
12209481	eng	I guessed the answer.
12209493	eng	The boy is here.
12209596	eng	He lies without conscience.
12209622	eng	I can go now.
12209625	eng	Welcome to our building.
12209646	eng	Children are new people.
12209699	eng	You've struck a nerve.
12209709	eng	I saw your plans.
12209797	eng	The weather is shit!
12209803	eng	Tom made the playoffs.
12209886	eng	What a dreadful idea!
12209927	eng	I think he's intelligent.
12209929	eng	I find him intelligent.
12209931	eng	You've reached marriage age.
12209975	eng	What a cute dress!
12209977	eng	I saw something horrible.
12209980	eng	I saw Tom's photos.
12210067	eng	Did you change anything?
12210070	eng	You only knew German.
12210097	eng	Does that change anything?
12210103	eng	They've written three books.
12210105	eng	You wanted to change.
12210106	eng	They want a cat.
12210172	eng	Owls feed on lemmings.
12210179	eng	Look at me carefully.
12210198	eng	Have you been fishing?
12210232	eng	Tom owns this shop.
12210294	eng	We were in Berlin.
12210304	eng	What a careless guy!
12210308	eng	Your comments are welcome.
12210362	eng	Tom may know more.
12210381	eng	Any news about Tom?
12210384	eng	Where is your scarf?
12210889	eng	There's a bridge there.
12210897	eng	Spring smiled at her.
12210898	eng	Spring smiled at him.
12210905	eng	You sound very chipper.
12210909	eng	Have you auditioned before?
12210975	eng	I'm buying something new.
12210986	eng	I'm more than satisfied.
12211079	eng	I found your necklace.
12211116	eng	Take some good advice.
12211147	eng	That sounds pretty complicated.
12211154	eng	What do diplomats do?
12211357	eng	Call those men back.
12211381	eng	This isn't very easy.
12211414	eng	Are you doing good?
12211515	eng	I found something here.
12211622	eng	Why isn't he moving?
12211623	eng	Why isn't it moving?
12211627	eng	Why isn't she moving?
12211681	eng	The fire's going out.
12211683	eng	There's a simpler method.
12211685	eng	There's an easier method.
12211708	eng	It's a borderline case.
12211711	eng	They're both doing well.
12211757	eng	Hide if someone comes.
12211759	eng	What a beautiful moon!
12211819	eng	I found something there.
12211845	eng	Did you call anyone?
12211851	eng	What are you translating?
12211881	eng	Every child is playing.
12211887	eng	I had three maids.
12212123	eng	I found some rope.
12212126	eng	Tom wants more chocolate.
12212130	eng	Leave that to Tom.
12212180	eng	Obviously, you were right.
12212238	eng	It works once again.
12212247	eng	This is Tom Jackson.
12212481	eng	Buy a honey-baked ham.
12212628	eng	An ice cream, please.
12212662	eng	You sound pretty sick.
12212718	eng	You'd better buy something.
12212773	eng	One must be imaginative.
12212799	eng	Tom sought Mary's advice.
12212886	eng	Look at this woman.
12213303	eng	Which one cost more?
12213310	eng	Tom was completely alone.
12213454	eng	What even are cats?
12213455	eng	I'm sixty-two years old.
12213456	eng	Does she live alone?
12213457	eng	Does he live alone?
12213462	eng	I like this park.
12213465	eng	It's terribly hot here.
12213474	eng	We'll settle up later.
12213475	eng	Have you used that?
12213482	eng	Is this your style?
12213494	eng	He's doing abdominal exercises.
12213502	eng	The bear likes honey.
12213515	eng	He solves his problems.
12213520	eng	I've got no passport.
12213521	eng	She's also your daughter.
12213524	eng	Therapy could help Tom.
12213561	eng	Classes end tomorrow morning.
12213566	eng	That looks rather complicated.
12213571	eng	He visited England twice.
12213575	eng	You looked, didn't you?
12213583	eng	I saw your report.
12213605	eng	Tom ran home, crying.
12213611	eng	Did you really faint?
12213664	eng	Have you ever surfed?
12213665	eng	Hide behind the couch.
12213708	eng	This is very complicated.
12213740	eng	I am Tom Hunter.
12213787	eng	Mistakes are being made.
12214129	eng	Birds don't have teeth.
12214132	eng	I found your knife.
12214147	eng	You're too on edge.
12214242	eng	Tom left us alone.
12214247	eng	Have you been suspended?
12214249	eng	Put on your sunglasses.
12214490	eng	What a careless girl!
12214591	eng	Tom is taking forever.
12214644	eng	I saw a frog.
12214677	eng	That mountain is high.
12214680	eng	Today no, tomorrow yes.
12215018	eng	Love ain’t for keeping.
12215020	eng	Let it hang out.
12215028	eng	I lost weight recently.
12215034	eng	Just keep it nice.
12215079	eng	Tell us about Boston.
12215096	eng	Don't speak so quickly.
12215115	eng	Would she like it?
12215138	eng	You sound really hopeful.
12215155	eng	I saw your photo.
12215160	eng	Everyone needs a hobby.
12215186	eng	Our problems are irreconcilable.
12215266	eng	I fixed the problem.
12215343	eng	Tom is getting heavy.
12215360	eng	I'll seek professional advice.
12215404	eng	My fingers are freezing.
12215425	eng	I've been beaten up.
12215426	eng	They've been beaten up.
12215798	eng	Would Tom like it?
12215803	eng	Okay, we'll meet tomorrow!
12215809	eng	I'll make an effort!
12215810	eng	"Who's there?" "It's Tom."
12215814	eng	Everything's fine, thank you.
12215833	eng	They didn't stop working.
12215834	eng	They haven't stopped working.
12215844	eng	Relax and be yourself.
12215853	eng	Where's Mark? He's showering.
12215855	eng	Let it be so!
12216046	eng	Tom had a relapse.
12216116	eng	I just quit smoking.
12216181	eng	I love you intensely!
12216222	eng	What was it about?
12216366	eng	I had shingles once.
12216486	eng	Nobody ever notices me.
12216645	eng	I feel very alone.
12216762	eng	Did you become angry?
12216801	eng	What animal is brown?
12216902	eng	Yesterday Tom went missing.
12216915	eng	I solved your problem.
12216924	eng	Did you eat shrimp?
12216970	eng	You've got some nerve!
12216976	eng	I'm still reading something.
12217026	eng	You're an odd one!
12217039	eng	I'll eat your soup.
12217054	eng	These are kids' toys.
12217063	eng	That was surprisingly uncomplicated.
12217077	eng	Where could I go?
12217083	eng	I can hit it.
12217106	eng	The Kia is Dad's.
12217226	eng	Let's not discuss politics.
12217255	eng	I've become a director.
12217330	eng	Tom leaves us alone.
12217333	eng	Hide behind the car.
12217338	eng	Which one costs more?
12217341	eng	Tom stole my drawing.
12217347	eng	Hide in the basement.
12217354	eng	I ate the peanuts.
12217355	eng	I have an orange.
12217356	eng	I've got an orange.
12217360	eng	You're almost like family.
12217370	eng	We'll win at last.
12217371	eng	We used that table.
12217397	eng	Tom refused to sign.
12217399	eng	I'll take Tom there.
12217400	eng	How is Tom traveling?
12217403	eng	Did you eat supper?
12217407	eng	I saw your photographs.
12217447	eng	Gods didn't like that.
12217458	eng	Tom was my informant.
12217461	eng	That was Tom calling.
12217490	eng	I had everyone fooled.
12217494	eng	Tom is having problems.
12217621	eng	She looks well today.
12217622	eng	She looks good today.
12217623	eng	She's looking good today.
12217624	eng	She's looking well today.
12217646	eng	She enjoys the limelight.
12217682	eng	Peter is a labourer.
12217722	eng	We did that intentionally.
12217723	eng	We did it intentionally.
12217998	eng	I'm not particularly fussy.
12218218	eng	I saw some sheep.
12218318	eng	Do you speak Mandarin?
12218321	eng	Squirrels have bushy tails.
12218353	eng	Have you made preparations?
12218354	eng	I heard Cookie barking.
12218464	eng	What a huge place!
12218470	eng	Notify Tom right away.
12218484	eng	I found your inhaler.
12218497	eng	That's all we said.
12218501	eng	Let's save the bees.
12218520	eng	Don't sweeten my coffee.
12218560	eng	Damn, my head hurts.
12218637	eng	It's a school break.
12218743	eng	This is incredibly cheap.
12218790	eng	You are the victor.
12218932	eng	You're cracking me up.
12219024	eng	This guy sings well.
12219025	eng	This dude sings well.
12219027	eng	This chap sings well.
12219041	eng	You cannot compare that.
12219053	eng	Is your name Jean?
12219054	eng	She was nearing despair.
12219061	eng	He smokes too much.
12219118	eng	Give me what's mine.
12219121	eng	I want a trampoline.
12219122	eng	Tom was found strangled.
12219129	eng	We believe in them!
12219145	eng	What a horrible kid!
12219147	eng	Which half is ours?
12219157	eng	Have you had enough?
12219264	eng	Call back at lunchtime.
12219271	eng	I've found a sponsor.
12219333	eng	Have you been subpoenaed?
12219362	eng	Did you leave alone?
12219422	eng	Have you been hunting?
12219432	eng	Look what Tom made.
12219634	eng	Get up to work.
12219801	eng	Call the embassy first.
12219821	eng	What is Russia's capital?
12219851	eng	You're counting on us.
12219870	eng	Can I show them?
12219981	eng	This is our Tom.
12220050	eng	You're a lovely woman.
12220149	eng	Where are your goggles?
12220318	eng	I can let go.
12220323	eng	Tom hurt his ribs.
12220464	eng	Have you injured yourself?
12220638	eng	Call back this afternoon.
12220652	eng	Which one is prettier?
12220924	eng	Did you bring flowers?
12221041	eng	Tom fought alongside John.
12221064	eng	Tom had a gift.
12221117	eng	Tom has been reinstated.
12221137	eng	I found an error.
12221138	eng	Tom knew that already.
12221149	eng	He's our third son.
12221150	eng	You're a devious liar.
12221151	eng	I took zero pictures.
12221156	eng	Time passes so fast.
12221157	eng	Time passes so quickly.
12221165	eng	Oatmeal is very nutritious.
12221169	eng	You see the tree.
12221173	eng	I don't visit them.
12221174	eng	I'm not visiting them.
12221179	eng	I dislike those words.
12221192	eng	Those are my tools.
12221202	eng	The excursion was canceled.
12221211	eng	Doubt protects against risk.
12221214	eng	John copied some sentences.
12221255	eng	I saw your designs.
12221315	eng	You sound pretty desperate.
12221317	eng	Tom may be indicted.
12221367	eng	Tom writes very fast.
12221425	eng	Our marriage is complicated.
12221464	eng	I'll eat you up.
12221539	eng	What's her first name?

12222303	eng	We'll have the money.
12222306	eng	The recipient is unknown.
12222329	eng	That's a dangerous thing.
12222330	eng	That's a dangerous matter.
12222335	eng	This vehicle isn't mine.
12222340	eng	The forest is hostile.

12222838	eng	Do your own job!
12222866	eng	I saw your livestream.
12222880	eng	What are you recommending?
12222969	eng	Being here is dangerous.
12223040	eng	I saw your paintings.
12223133	eng	Did Tom call again?
12223140	eng	Where is your toilet?
12223142	eng	Doing this is dangerous.
12223164	eng	I don't like snakes.
12223196	eng	I was absolutely petrified.
12223197	eng	Tom hurt himself again.
12223220	eng	Tom came home exhausted.
12223264	eng	We'll live there forever.
12223279	eng	Tom made this one.
12223280	eng	Did you call security?
12223292	eng	They wrote a book.
12223304	eng	Yes, one coffee please.
12223311	eng	Tom has gloves on.
12223313	eng	Tom liked those tomatoes.
12223350	eng	I found nothing interesting.
12223351	eng	Tom wanted a raise.
12223352	eng	Am I too crazy?
12223353	eng	Nobody can prove that.
12223372	eng	Have you been summoned?
12223373	eng	I love chick flicks.
12223379	eng	Locate Tom for me.
12223666	eng	We did it deliberately.
12223740	eng	Who wants some biscuits?

12223867	eng	The couple split up.
12223920	eng	Was the brandy poisoned?
12224048	eng	What a glorious experience!
12224193	eng	I found some wine.
12224219	eng	Nobody could trust anybody.
12224514	eng	Give Tom the box.
12224590	eng	You're not my dad.
12224593	eng	Tom should tell Mary.
12224602	eng	Nobody ever loved me.
12224739	eng	Tom prefers unsweetened applesauce.
12224777	eng	They sometimes did that.
12224965	eng	Are you drinking alone?
12224972	eng	Add salt and pepper.
12225021	eng	They haul heavy packages.
12225023	eng	They're carrying heavy packages.

12227067	eng	Is it already over?
12227068	eng	Is it over already?
12227189	eng	Have you been expelled?
12227231	eng	I don't have autism.
12227326	eng	Mary always liked women.
12227360	eng	This is something old.
12227376	eng	The radiator is broken.
12227381	eng	Tom has the money.
12227382	eng	Which way is home?
12227385	eng	I live in Alaska.

12228286	eng	I'm improving my Breton.
12228298	eng	Chamois move in leaps.
12228309	eng	Tom, are you home?
12228365	eng	The jar is leaking.
12228371	eng	I'm paying the bill.
12228380	eng	That was very effective.
12228388	eng	I'm a little absent-minded.
12228460	eng	Where is his book?
12228464	eng	He returned to China.
12228470	eng	Yes, I see it.

12228608	eng	Today is her baptism.
12228609	eng	Today is his baptism.

12229238	eng	I eat in secret.
12229275	eng	Don't trust automatic translators.
12229283	eng	I'll answer you immediately.
12229286	eng	He's paying the bill.
12229287	eng	Heating costs a lot.
12229297	eng	Forget this ever happened.
12229302	eng	This thing is new.
12229317	eng	I found something unusual.
12229324	eng	He's losing his modesty.

12229333	eng	Tom kept himself hidden.
12229338	eng	Let us meet Tom.

12229394	eng	Did you call earlier?
12229416	eng	Tom has cheated me.
12229460	eng	Order me a burger.

12231876	eng	Tom looked really nervous.
12231963	eng	This is extremely interesting.
12231969	eng	Don't wake up Tom.
12231979	eng	The season only started.
12231991	eng	He's copying my sentences.

12232794	eng	What a classy place!
12232795	eng	I saw Tom dying.
12232827	eng	We're already in winter.
12232829	eng	Memory must be exercised.
12232840	eng	What influenced your decision?

12258138	eng	She went out early.
12258179	eng	She has a mill.
12258184	eng	Did you feel hot?
12258186	eng	We didn't eat persimmon.

12258435	eng	It hurt to breathe.
12258478	eng	They're not very friendly.
12258480	eng	You're not very friendly.
12258492	eng	I saw that drawing.
12258493	eng	I saw Tom's scar.
12258529	eng	Tom seems rather unwell.
12258541	eng	Did you eat popcorn?

12258757	eng	Tom's disillusionment was obvious.
12258761	eng	"Goal," said the announcer.
12258762	eng	That narrator is fantastic!
12258764	eng	That sportscaster is fantastic!
12258768	eng	This narrator is fantastic!
12258769	eng	This sportscaster is fantastic!
12258785	eng	This is a fiasco.
12258791	eng	This is a pomegranate.
12258792	eng	Do you like pomegranate?
12258793	eng	The rifle went off.
12258795	eng	What do commentators do?
12258803	eng	It's like inciting self-destruction.
12258816	eng	"What's your nationality?" "Lebanese."

12259198	eng	It's really worth it!
12259240	eng	Does your head itch?
12259246	eng	This is an anvil.
12259251	eng	This is an appetizer.
12259280	eng	Let's whet your appetite.
12259333	eng	I saw Tom's disappointment.
12259375	eng	His hands are smooth.
12259393	eng	We should run immediately.
12259409	eng	Aksil is a doctor.
12259462	eng	I found that here.
12259580	eng	I found some typos.
12259639	eng	That definitely complicated things.
12259677	eng	Tom is a tenor.
12259678	eng	Mary is an alto.
12259679	eng	Mary is a soprano.
12259685	eng	Was I too curious?
12259754	eng	I wasn't thinking that.

12260210	eng	What a great episode!
12260212	eng	Did you arrest anybody?
12260377	eng	Nobody ever thanked me.
12260475	eng	Which is your husband?
12260540	eng	They're searching for me.
12260561	eng	Thanks for your trust!
12260568	eng	Well, just do it!
12260594	eng	Thanks for the trust!
12260602	eng	Stop touching my things!
12260642	eng	Have you added sugar?

12261166	eng	Our kids are friends.
12261177	eng	Tom has been ill.
12261178	eng	I would've acted differently.
12261182	eng	Leave the Jacksons alone.

12261424	eng	I found someone else.
12261426	eng	Did you get punished?
12261471	eng	No human lives here.

12261493	eng	I'd like something sweet.
12261496	eng	I'd like a discount.
12261498	eng	Did you rinse everything?

12261967	eng	Did you nod off?
12261973	eng	I feel terribly thirsty.
12262035	eng	Congratulations on the publication.
12262045	eng	Is this a poem?
12262073	eng	Have you been writing?
12262082	eng	You're never completely alone.
12262143	eng	Tom is alone now.
12262148	eng	It's too easy otherwise.
12262255	eng	That could delight us.
12262270	eng	I'd advise against that.
12262294	eng	I feel upset, too.
12262329	eng	Tom was set free.
12262358	eng	Mary wants a son.
12262360	eng	This clock is right.
12262367	eng	I feel pretty tired.

12262677	eng	Tom is well protected.
12262986	eng	I feel quite well.
12262989	eng	Our plan is good.
12263123	eng	Which one is this?
12263130	eng	You should've brought Tom.
12263134	eng	We're free at last.

12263238	eng	Did you order coffee?
12263283	eng	Tom helped us out.
12263285	eng	Our plan has changed.

12263622	eng	The photo is deceptive.
12263623	eng	The picture is deceptive.
12263638	eng	They're meeting the teacher.
12263664	eng	Am I completely alone?
12263685	eng	Our way is better.
12263769	eng	Mary has a car.
12263775	eng	Will Sami be late?

12263798	eng	Did you try surfing?
12263830	eng	What a fantastic garden!
12263854	eng	Tom nearly died today.
12263856	eng	I feel lonely tonight.

12264189	eng	Our luggage is outside.
12264279	eng	Tom is somewhat crazy.
12264280	eng	You should've been quicker.
12264402	eng	Tom was working alone.
12264406	eng	You should've worn boots.
12264519	eng	Surprisingly, it still works.
12264551	eng	I don't like heights.
12264552	eng	Tom will be moved.
12264649	eng	I shall come back.
12264659	eng	Will you be late?
12264703	eng	They're meeting the professor.

12265229	eng	You should've protected Tom.
12265231	eng	Did you get excused?
12265257	eng	He's no longer alone.
12265260	eng	You should've tried harder.
12265262	eng	Did you sleep outside?
12265332	eng	There's no use crying.
12265375	eng	My parents were murdered.
12265378	eng	Tom didn't even apologise.

12265401	eng	"Everything all right?" "Fine!"
12265421	eng	We've all been lucky.
12265422	eng	We were all lucky.
12265429	eng	Our luck just changed.
12265489	eng	Our orders are clear.
12265569	eng	You should've obeyed me.
12265608	eng	Put your pen down.
12265610	eng	Our lips remained sealed.
12265804	eng	I object to Tom.
12265828	eng	The love is over.

12265894	eng	That's interesting, isn't it?
12265955	eng	It hurts to breathe.
12266089	eng	You should've defended me.
12266093	eng	Leave those people alone.
12266222	eng	He deserves to die.
12266283	eng	Our heater is broken.
12266289	eng	Did you verify that?
12266298	eng	Tom believes in nothing.
12266367	eng	I can't find it!
12266368	eng	Did you go someplace?
12266370	eng	Our mission has failed.

12270907	eng	What's Tom afraid of.
12270911	eng	I'd never fire Tom.
12270957	eng	I feel satisfied now.
12271009	eng	Tom was stabbed here.
12271026	eng	I seldom jog alone.

12273885	eng	My name is Mehmet.
12273974	eng	I don't go anywhere.
12273991	eng	You should've hired help.

12274117	eng	You guys have crabs.
12274119	eng	Does he have crabs?

12274177	eng	I feel really drowsy.
12274179	eng	Did you introduce yourself?
12274233	eng	You should've wakened me.
12274308	eng	Our meeting is over.
12274314	eng	You make us laugh!
12274334	eng	I'd like a cappuccino.
12274351	eng	I like iced tea.

12274702	eng	Our priority is safety.
12274737	eng	You can all leave.
12274752	eng	You should've said hi.
12274793	eng	Our method is experimental.
12274904	eng	I always travel alone.
12275005	eng	His joke didn't land.
12275078	eng	Tom was a cop.
12275182	eng	I'd definitely try that.
12275201	eng	Don't fall for it.
12275213	eng	I have a chauffeur.
12275226	eng	Maybe she's just hungry.
12275290	eng	Tom gets driven everywhere.
12275296	eng	Our morale is low.
12275360	eng	I would've hired Tom.
12275446	eng	He slammed the brakes.
12275470	eng	Tom did show up.
12275545	eng	The food stayed there.
12275674	eng	This language is incomprehensible.
12275729	eng	You only dreamt that.
12275781	eng	No one was stopped.
12275795	eng	We finally got home!
12275811	eng	He hasn't been tricked.

12276264	eng	I feel confident again.
12276366	eng	I would've been heartbroken.
12276459	eng	I feel quite embarrassed.
12276529	eng	Stegosaurs were armoured dinosaurs.
12276761	eng	Did you persuade Tom?
12276773	eng	Put your phones away.
12276817	eng	This investigation has priority.
12277093	eng	I'd like to change.
12277570	eng	That's a good word!
12277576	eng	Come by again tomorrow.

12277656	eng	Today I'm eating gata.
12277663	eng	These mittens are hand-knit.
12277671	eng	Tom needs a shirt.

12277801	eng	Don't take that risk.
12277844	eng	Tom has never smoked.
12277863	eng	People don't like Tom.
12277865	eng	She had pretty eyes.
12277879	eng	I suddenly feel hungry.

12291264	eng	Our dog got hurt.
12291337	eng	Tom had an attack.

12294225	eng	Did you phone anyone?

12296584	eng	Our feud is over.
12296657	eng	How was Tom captured?
12296680	eng	The shaking finally stopped.
12296681	eng	We all die someday.
12296687	eng	This might be yours.
12296751	eng	There are various reasons.
12296868	eng	That makes me furious!
12296904	eng	This is a woodpecker.

12303602	eng	Sales have recently increased.
12303632	eng	History does repeat itself.
12303637	eng	I feel like leaving.
12303649	eng	Your door isn't closed.
12303670	eng	Our plan was solid.
12303705	eng	Where's your younger brother?
12303814	eng	These are slick tires.
12303866	eng	You should've warned us.
12303986	eng	You should've thanked me.
12304104	eng	Our fates are linked.
12304291	eng	Our goal is different.
12304548	eng	Tom dropped us off.
12304635	eng	I like dry wine.
12304640	eng	Each in their turn.
12304665	eng	After sorrow comes joy.
12304667	eng	After sorrow comes happiness.
12304692	eng	I'd like an invitation.
12304829	eng	I feel cooler now.
12304836	eng	Our nannies were friends.
12304841	eng	Tom publicly humiliated Mary.
12304845	eng	I hate traveling alone.
12304904	eng	I'd like an apology.
12304972	eng	Our plan is flawless.
12304999	eng	I'm a fast runner.
12305000	eng	I have beautiful legs.
12305025	eng	I'm not even sorry.
12305028	eng	You're not a detective.
12305031	eng	You're not Tom's boss.
12305032	eng	You're not Tom's father.
12305035	eng	Tom is your son.
12305036	eng	The baby is yours.
12305037	eng	I'd welcome your help.
12305038	eng	Our membership is down.
12305040	eng	Tom wants a drink.
12305071	eng	Tom hated it there.
12305115	eng	Tom continued crying quietly.
12305233	eng	We heard about you.
12305246	eng	I live it everyday.
12305291	eng	Truth is a lie.
12305295	eng	I'm a good actor.
12305296	eng	Do you like teaching?
12305322	eng	Are you the spy?
12305328	eng	You are without conscience!
12305330	eng	They overlooked the warning.
12305347	eng	The color isn't me.
12305353	eng	After pain comes joy.
12305358	eng	That color isn't me.
12305362	eng	She sings like that.
12305363	eng	You sing like that.
12305367	eng	Eight hours have passed.
12305370	eng	It's a good university.
12305371	eng	It's a good college.
12305376	eng	I won't drive today.
12305378	eng	The fish is fresh.
12305381	eng	What a generous gesture!
12305386	eng	Our enemies are vicious.
12305451	eng	You should've phoned us.
12305452	eng	Tom is sure picky.
12305453	eng	I feel very comfortable.
12305506	eng	I feel your disapproval.
12305514	eng	You should've invited Tom.
12305702	eng	Did you walk here?
12305703	eng	I feel totally refreshed.
12305705	eng	Did Tom suspect something?
12305706	eng	Our radiator is broken.
12305894	eng	Tom will keep searching.
12306189	eng	I feel really silly.
12306736	eng	This could be problematic.
12306834	eng	Put my cardigan on.
12306883	eng	Some people travel alone.
12306886	eng	I feel warm now.
12307263	eng	Did Tom leave anything?
12307272	eng	I'd never abandon you.
12307323	eng	Did you hear screams?
12307324	eng	Our rates are competitive.
12307325	eng	Tom might be unraveling.
12307326	eng	I'd rather walk home.
12307329	eng	Our fate is predestined.
12307366	eng	Our situation has changed.
12307368	eng	Our kids are fighting.
12307446	eng	Our neighbors are jerks.
12307448	eng	We were engaged once.
12307474	eng	The toilet is blocked.
12307477	eng	The toilets are blocked.
12307510	eng	You should've done this.
12307511	eng	You should've informed me.
12307595	eng	We're angry about this.
12307601	eng	I feel really hot.
12307657	eng	That's for damn sure!
12307669	eng	Send me towards home.
12307671	eng	You know a few.
12307728	eng	Are you dining alone?
12307979	eng	You should've phoned first.
12308036	eng	They were playing checkers.
12308116	eng	Soldiers were digging trenches.
12308144	eng	Tom pinched his nose.
12308150	eng	It's called leech therapy.
12308151	eng	Does leech therapy work?
12308169	eng	People are generally good.
12308498	eng	I'm writing a story.
12308585	eng	Our paths rarely crossed.
12308617	eng	We're out of onions.
12308618	eng	Margaret Thatcher is dead.
12308622	eng	Don't trust Tom's words.
12308625	eng	The market is nearby.
12308644	eng	Tom is chasing me.
12308663	eng	You should've been angry.
12308668	eng	You can go alone.
12308823	eng	Our plan was successful.
12308826	eng	Did you order soup?
12308832	eng	Have you met everyone?
12308896	eng	I would've feigned interest.
12308934	eng	Were you all alone?
12308935	eng	I would've just laughed.
12308976	eng	I feel really terrible.
12308978	eng	Tom would've loved you.
12309020	eng	I feel invisible here.
12309022	eng	We respect your opinion.
12309030	eng	Tom a timid person.
12309044	eng	I feel miserable today.
12309046	eng	Our paths never crossed.
12309047	eng	Tom made you cupcakes.
12309058	eng	Somebody's calling my name.
12309124	eng	I feel lousy today.
12309145	eng	I can get up.
12309153	eng	You should've helped us.
12309184	eng	I'm curious about that.
12309253	eng	Tom is always ready.
12309257	eng	He is late today.
12309368	eng	Are you three hungry?
12309494	eng	Pardon me for intruding.
12309847	eng	He caused damage there.
12309903	eng	Our mouths were watering.
12310041	eng	We are shivering cold.
12310047	eng	I trembled with fear.
12310071	eng	Their faces changed colour.
12310081	eng	Did you get pizza?
12310090	eng	You should've considered this.
12310312	eng	We don't want bloodshed.
12310431	eng	You should've kept walking.
12310524	eng	Did you get fireworks?
12310527	eng	Our enemies are everywhere.
12310577	eng	Tom has my ladder.
12310600	eng	Our numbers are down.
12310602	eng	Our luggage was stolen.
12310605	eng	The horses are back!
12310676	eng	Did you get coffee?
12310679	eng	Didn't you eat anything?
12310730	eng	I quit in October.
12310776	eng	Did you shower today?
12310788	eng	I'm 16 years old.
12310789	eng	Our future is uncertain.
12310821	eng	I feel very thirsty.
12310825	eng	Did you go fishing?
12310832	eng	I'd love some lemonade.
12310833	eng	I feel relaxed now.
12310835	eng	Tom, get your things.
12310836	eng	I feel cooler already.
12310853	eng	Tom left it there.
12310863	eng	I feel very dizzy.
12310891	eng	The Zeppelin caught fire.
12311175	eng	Lilies don't always bloom.
12311211	eng	I'd just order pizza.
12311214	eng	You should've stayed home.
12311221	eng	I'd like to escape.
12311264	eng	Esperanto belongs to everyone.
12311270	eng	Everyone immediately understood everything.
12311278	eng	He doesn't deserve that.
12311306	eng	People are different here.
12311328	eng	Photocopying kills the book.
12311450	eng	God is an elephant.
12311605	eng	She rejected his help.
12311944	eng	Tom came home alone.
12311995	eng	Our interests are similar.
12312068	eng	There isn't anything left.
12312098	eng	It's your turn now.
12312111	eng	You should've phoned earlier.
12312137	eng	They crossed the line.
12312167	eng	This is a pretzel.
12312169	eng	You should've called back.
12312187	eng	We're tired of fighting.
12312191	eng	I feel terribly upset.
12312196	eng	Their lies cost lives.
12312238	eng	Did Tom come alone?
12312259	eng	Let's meet up tomorrow.
12312495	eng	Our mission was successful.
12312499	eng	I've been living alone.
12312555	eng	Tom is feeling hungry.
12312679	eng	Our fates are sealed.
12312851	eng	My mouth was watering.
12312854	eng	Tom definitely hates me.
12312903	eng	What is a hominid?
12313331	eng	Our rates are negotiable.
12313546	eng	His time has come.
12313549	eng	Their time has come.
12313637	eng	I'd never believe that.
12313642	eng	I feel warmer now.
12313724	eng	Did you try knocking?
12313902	eng	Our troops are ready.
12313946	eng	Did you sing songs?
12313948	eng	Apparently, Tom lives alone.
12313971	eng	It's a shooting star.
12314026	eng	People come from everywhere.
12314031	eng	I'd have to concur.
12314061	eng	Tom is against me.
12314103	eng	I'd really enjoy it.
12314105	eng	Paramedics are en route.
12314108	eng	Our neighbors are quiet.
12314173	eng	I feel surprisingly good.
12314253	eng	Know where to hide.
12314260	eng	I feel really bloated.
12314288	eng	I can't draw birds.
12314370	eng	I took the plushie.
12314371	eng	I like teddy bears.
12314445	eng	Tom has decided otherwise.
12314535	eng	His scythe hit stone.
12314595	eng	This is the detachment.
12314596	eng	This is the team.
12314599	eng	The detachment fought valiantly.
12314615	eng	I'm trying to grumble.
12314632	eng	I've already forgiven Tom.
12314637	eng	This is a jellyfish.
12314662	eng	Emma likes relishing strawberries.
12314692	eng	This blood is picturesque.
12314762	eng	Our parents are worried.
12315023	eng	Our prisons are packed.
12315030	eng	Did you get milk?
12315359	eng	You should've said please.
12315759	eng	Tom was a fool.
12315786	eng	That's a pathologizing term.
12315824	eng	Who's with you guys?
12315831	eng	He was with him.
12315832	eng	She was with her.
12315932	eng	Our water was poisoned.
12315936	eng	I feel very scared.
12316019	eng	He likes to flirt.
12316020	eng	Stop flirting with me!
12316021	eng	Sales is like flirting.
12316046	eng	Who's ready to command?
12316056	eng	That reproach is unfair.
12316062	eng	Worrying causes gray hair.
12316066	eng	Paparazzi follow me everywhere.
12316072	eng	I was completely alone.
12316141	eng	I feel so ashamed.
12316231	eng	I would've fired you.
12316282	eng	Our relationship is strong.
12316284	eng	I feel utterly ridiculous.
12316292	eng	I'd suggest you reconsider.
12316405	eng	Please sing for us.
12316423	eng	You may sit anywhere.
12316432	eng	Tom has to rest.
12316444	eng	Please get in line.
12316459	eng	Please wait a sec.
12316476	eng	Why was Tom running?
12316493	eng	Please come after 2:30.
12316513	eng	Let's meet again tomorrow.
12316527	eng	The kids like it.
12316596	eng	This is a rectangle.
12316732	eng	The driver was intoxicated.
12316758	eng	Did you make reservations?
12316797	eng	That's a fake gem.
12316908	eng	Children go to school.
12316925	eng	Did you inform Tom?
12316959	eng	You didn't know that?
12317165	eng	Didn't you feel lonely?
12317333	eng	I love his skits.
12317334	eng	I love her skits.
12317350	eng	The water is purified.
12317372	eng	The cosmos is fictional.
12317477	eng	The name is unisex.
12317487	eng	You should've concentrated more.
12317496	eng	Tom is very well-connected.
12317537	eng	I'd never harm anyone.
12317538	eng	I feel really calm.
12317540	eng	I'd like to drive.
12317616	eng	Our meeting ran late.
12317678	eng	Did you make sandwiches?
12317692	eng	Maria is a dentist.
12317723	eng	Our vegetables are fresh.
12317742	eng	I feel rejuvenated now.
12317743	eng	Tom can say nothing.
12317745	eng	My breakfast was cereal.
12317747	eng	Nobody understands it yet.
12317756	eng	Who owns the restaurant?
12317790	eng	I feel lucky, too.
12317851	eng	He asks for money.
12317914	eng	Our fathers are brothers.
12318130	eng	Tom is still last.
12318339	eng	That was a misunderstanding.
12318370	eng	Our trip was wonderful.
12318375	eng	Our plan was excellent.
12318387	eng	We really like her.
12318395	eng	They really like him.
12318408	eng	It suddenly got cold.
12318459	eng	Did you eat cake?
12318499	eng	Tom is acting crazy.
12318502	eng	How does it end?
12318565	eng	You should've arrived sooner.
12318567	eng	I work better alone.
12318634	eng	The child needs food.
12318727	eng	The thieves wore gloves.
12318835	eng	I feel really horrible.
12318892	eng	Somebody put it there.
12318969	eng	Tom is completely naked.
12318973	eng	A wolf bit Mary.
12318990	eng	This is too simple.
12319009	eng	I need my money.
12319014	eng	Did you record everything?
12319018	eng	It's a protection racket.
12319119	eng	I'd like to sing.
12319247	eng	Is Tom traveling alone?
12319343	eng	I arrived at midnight.
12319350	eng	The panorama is grandiose.
12319352	eng	The panorama is great.
12319355	eng	I have a sofa.
12319359	eng	Some professors use drugs.
12319361	eng	One citron tea, please!
12319367	eng	Please come here immediately.
12319401	eng	They have two residences.
12319404	eng	Come right away, please!
12319426	eng	We made rapid progress.
12319428	eng	We made quick progress.
12319436	eng	Mary was telling jokes.
12319464	eng	My family loves Tom.
12319486	eng	I called Judy's house.
12319514	eng	Tom is so photogenic.
12319515	eng	I'd like something stronger.
12319530	eng	I feel sleepy now.
12319552	eng	Did you try that?
12319556	eng	Our jobs are difficult.
12319576	eng	That's a vile falsehood.
12319598	eng	Our plan keeps changing.
12319602	eng	Our plan is simple.
12319613	eng	Did you move something?
12319616	eng	Is life just struggle?
12319617	eng	Is life only conflict?
12319627	eng	Our numbers are dwindling.
12319631	eng	I feel terribly sad.
12319645	eng	You were watching, right?
12319646	eng	You were looking, right?
12319647	eng	Relationships can be complicated.
12319650	eng	Tom was jogging alone.
12319654	eng	They're better than me.
12319664	eng	Tom picked a winner.
12319666	eng	You should've slept longer.
12319670	eng	I feel quite dizzy.
12319681	eng	Everybody has memory problems.
12319692	eng	I'd love some help.
12319694	eng	The boy needs food.
12319697	eng	I'm not your maid!
12319702	eng	I feel quite uncomfortable.
12319716	eng	Tom died last autumn.
12319719	eng	Who talks like that?
12319733	eng	My name is Charlotte.
12319736	eng	My name is Amelia.
12319738	eng	My name is Sophia.
12319745	eng	The judges were bribed.
12319746	eng	I'd like to enter.
12319755	eng	Please stop the car.
12319761	eng	I won't say no.
12319873	eng	I feel very well.
12319874	eng	You must go alone.
12320035	eng	Tom was helping out.
12320174	eng	I feel very ashamed.
12320315	eng	That sounds really complicated.
12320331	eng	I hated living alone.
12320625	eng	I'd like some rum.
12320769	eng	Our relationship is platonic.
12320865	eng	I feel really scared.
12320930	eng	I feel your excitement.
12320931	eng	I highly recommend this.
12320989	eng	Did you use fertilizer?
12321001	eng	You should've protected us.
12321153	eng	I hate drinking alone.
12321317	eng	Why is crime illegal?
12321348	eng	Look at those ducks!
12321350	eng	Look at those ducklings!
12321352	eng	Tom shot at us.
12321358	eng	We chose to fight.
12321365	eng	You need more experience.
12321410	eng	I will miss them.
12321435	eng	I'd love some cheesecake.
12321470	eng	He broke his shinbone.
12321471	eng	He broke his tibia.
12321474	eng	Perhaps Tom was alone.
12321495	eng	Tom let them go.
12321496	eng	Our friends are coming.
12321497	eng	Did you get nervous?
12321501	eng	They are so tired.
12321504	eng	They've released the hostages.
12321535	eng	Our motives are pure.
12321589	eng	I'd love your help.
12321636	eng	I would've been frightened.
12321638	eng	I feel very contented.
12321649	eng	You should've called home.
12321654	eng	Are we really alone?
12321661	eng	I'd like to volunteer.
12321664	eng	Our power went out.
12321667	eng	Tom will kill us.
12321694	eng	I dislike swimming alone.
12321698	eng	Tom is seriously concerned.
12321719	eng	He is my relative.
12321723	eng	People respect me here.
12321779	eng	Our needs are different.
12321797	eng	I would've anticipated that.
12321808	eng	Our mothers are sisters.
12321811	eng	I prefer living alone.
12321838	eng	Tom should accompany us.
12321840	eng	Did you get wounded?
12321843	eng	I have sickle-cell disease.
12321861	eng	I feel very exposed.
12321923	eng	Tom's intentions are honorable.
12322023	eng	People are living longer.
12322138	eng	Did you write anything?
12322273	eng	Tom just passed out.
12322432	eng	Registration starts in October.
12322744	eng	I feel really fat.
12322846	eng	Our house is small.
12322931	eng	Give Tom some cereal.
12323169	eng	You should've called 911.
12323322	eng	It's getting dangerous here.
12323343	eng	Our flight was rerouted.
12323448	eng	Tom obviously lived alone.
12323549	eng	You should've obeyed Tom.
12323557	eng	Did you light candles?
12323866	eng	Our parents need us.
12323888	eng	Did you look outside?
12323927	eng	Did you call everyone?
12323929	eng	Tom went with me.
12323933	eng	A crow cawed loudly.
12323950	eng	The book is thin.
12324001	eng	My flashlight is dead.
12324009	eng	Our neighbors hate us.
12324122	eng	People are different today.
12324153	eng	Leave those guys alone.
12324154	eng	Take care of mom.
12324181	eng	I feel pretty ashamed.
12324184	eng	I feel somewhat obligated.
12324219	eng	My baby is hungry.
12324347	eng	Our hands were tied.
12324369	eng	Tom never left us.
12324372	eng	Have you paid already?
12324455	eng	Both sides are lying.
12324477	eng	Our fears are justified.
12324528	eng	Leave my sister alone.
12324557	eng	Did you watch Tom?
12324588	eng	You should've just lied.
12324630	eng	I feel totally relaxed.
12324633	eng	Tom must be nearby.
12324636	eng	I'd like your advice.
12324667	eng	Hide behind the piano.
12324672	eng	I felt comfortable there.
12324678	eng	I took the opportunity.
12324689	eng	She took the opportunity.
12324725	eng	Tom must be kidding.
12324788	eng	Our fee is nonnegotiable.
12324810	eng	The dog has escaped.
12324932	eng	You're better off alone.
12325018	eng	Have you tried hypnosis?
12325145	eng	This isn't a condom.
12325171	eng	He's quick with rejoinders.
12325223	eng	They're really comfortable shoes.
12325313	eng	Wise men love virtue.
12325690	eng	I'd love some coffee.
12325904	eng	My dogs are hungry.
12325942	eng	Everyone has their ghosts.
12325970	eng	I'd highly recommend this.
12326186	eng	You should've mentioned that.
12326195	eng	Our moms are friends.
12326258	eng	You should've stayed here.
12326433	eng	Tom sent this here.
12326442	eng	Did Tom freak out?
12326467	eng	Cats hunt small animals.
12326468	eng	Tom loves the dog.
12326471	eng	Someone loves the dog.
12326473	eng	Look for the truth.
12326474	eng	Search for the truth.
12326475	eng	The bathroom is filthy.
12326476	eng	The bathroom is gross.
12326477	eng	The bathroom is nasty.
12326478	eng	The bathroom is disgusting.

12326551	eng	I don't miss him.
12326556	eng	She is so tired.
12326598	eng	I feel somewhat strange.
12326600	eng	Our mothers missed us.
12326618	eng	Our fates are intertwined.
12326620	eng	Our lives are changing.
12326623	eng	Pack me a lunch.
12326688	eng	I feel tired already.
12326700	eng	To continue, press hash.
12326702	eng	To continue, press pound.
12326732	eng	Tom loves us both.
12326754	eng	Dude, cut the crap.
12326756	eng	Such a stupid rule.
12326778	eng	I feel horrible today.

12327518	eng	Our stuff was stolen.
12327519	eng	I feel somewhat responsible.
12327552	eng	Did you translate this?
12327640	eng	I got awfully hungry.
12327698	eng	I have insulted him.
12327856	eng	You should've married Tom.
12327906	eng	Our future looks bright.
12327908	eng	I'd never kill someone.
12327937	eng	Dad's younger than Mom.
12327975	eng	Did you get popcorn?
12328029	eng	Is loitering a crime?
12328033	eng	Tom was awfully impressed.
12328043	eng	They clearly knew something.
12328053	eng	I think I'm up.
12328057	eng	We ran out early.
12328075	eng	Did you get dessert?
12328107	eng	Tom really amazed us.
12328116	eng	That's an inedible mushroom.
12328126	eng	What's your favorite place?
12328152	eng	Do they have gold?
12328153	eng	Do you have gold?
12328182	eng	Do we need gold?
12328187	eng	Do you need gold?
12328188	eng	Does she need gold?
12328201	eng	I saw a raven.
12328203	eng	You saw a raven.
12328239	eng	I'm not paying you.
12328322	eng	Traveling alone is boring.

12328459	eng	Give me a sign!
12328481	eng	You can sing, right?
12328501	eng	You will learn today.
12328505	eng	You will teach tomorrow.
12328510	eng	I'd like to act.
12328518	eng	He went away somewhere.
12328526	eng	I'd rather be home.
12328530	eng	Everything has two sides.
12328544	eng	I'm very depressed tonight.
12328632	eng	Coyotes are wild animals.
12328754	eng	Tom is culturing ergot.
12328861	eng	Don't trust just anybody!
12328904	eng	Our factory caught fire.
12328938	eng	What a fascinating thought!
12329389	eng	I couldn't do ballet.
12329452	eng	Someone stole my sandwich.
12329471	eng	I lost my iPhone.
12329493	eng	The movie was uninspired.
12329497	eng	I ran from everything.
12329498	eng	I ran to Iraq.
12329718	eng	Did you punch Tom?
12329866	eng	I'd like another sip.
12330643	eng	She's making a sandcastle.
12330646	eng	Did you get groceries?
12330681	eng	They never met him.
12330698	eng	You're too easily offended.
12330748	eng	Which glass is mine?
12330775	eng	Hand me that knife.
12330803	eng	We had two apples.
12330805	eng	You're my little boy.
12330812	eng	Did you invite anyone?
12330815	eng	Leave those three alone.
12330829	eng	It's a Chinese fan.
12330832	eng	Tom is very authoritative.
12330837	eng	She came from Jakarta.
12330843	eng	I feel cold now.
12330869	eng	This is forced emigration.
12330871	eng	I feel depressed already.
12331043	eng	Our problems are over.
12331134	eng	Our hopes were dashed.
12331175	eng	Fate doesn't make mistakes.
12331179	eng	That's a cruel fate.
12331222	eng	The statement awakened terror.
12331235	eng	The blade was serrated.
12331278	eng	I contemplated the painting.
12331285	eng	I feel rather tired.
12331287	eng	This is a napkin.
12331288	eng	This is the napkin.
12331292	eng	Let's go pheasant hunting.
12331342	eng	We're on opposing sides.
12331367	eng	I'd love your input.
12331416	eng	This turnstile doesn't work.
12331429	eng	I'm good with faces.
12331559	eng	Xerxes' soldiers killed Leonidas.
12331591	eng	I'd never blackmail you.
12331597	eng	Our journey is over.
12331606	eng	Stefan doesn't know either.
12331704	eng	I would've told Tom.
12331763	eng	What's her real name?
12331810	eng	The killer's behind bars.
12331836	eng	Please, make yourself comfortable.
12331838	eng	Sit here and wait!
12331856	eng	I dusted the furniture.
12331947	eng	I had to quit.
12331991	eng	Someone has poisoned Tom.
12332035	eng	What's in his knapsack?
12332055	eng	Let's not speak heresy!
12332058	eng	It's my favorite heresy.
12332063	eng	Pass me the gravy.
12332078	eng	Don't speak in riddles.
12332081	eng	This attitude is unacceptable!
12332082	eng	Your attitude is unacceptable!
12332089	eng	There's nothing poetic there.
12332163	eng	We don't read now.
12332172	eng	I read many books.
12332345	eng	I saw spiders everywhere.
12332388	eng	I feel responsible somehow.
12332492	eng	We're waiting for food.
12333132	eng	His teeth have gaps.
12333530	eng	People actually do that.
12333676	eng	Tom was an idiot.
12334020	eng	I feel awfully stupid.
12334273	eng	I feel really confused.
12334285	eng	Our mothers are close.
12334551	eng	Tom will miss us.
12334552	eng	You should've explained yourself.
12334558	eng	Mind if I indulge?
12334576	eng	People are expecting me.
12334612	eng	Did you get paid?
12334620	eng	Tom's trousers caught fire.
12334683	eng	I would've understood that.
12334728	eng	I would've fired Tom.
12334890	eng	This isn't a poem.
12334915	eng	I think you know.
12334916	eng	This isn't a charity.
12334928	eng	This isn't a basketball.
12334986	eng	Are you staying hydrated?
12335248	eng	It's important to talk.
12335259	eng	He hasn't realised yet.
12335311	eng	Tom can show us.
12335359	eng	He is with him.
12335365	eng	She is with her.
12335386	eng	She speaks Russian, too.
12335568	eng	I left her behind!
12335652	eng	They left them behind.
12335687	eng	I gave him up.
12335782	eng	I don't trust robots.
12335802	eng	He has multiple sclerosis.
12335805	eng	She has multiple sclerosis.
12335954	eng	I deny that's true.
12336006	eng	Hand me that screwdriver.
12336016	eng	He's in the castle.
12336019	eng	This isn't my favorite.
12336020	eng	It's not my favorite.
12336024	eng	Reasonable minds can differ.
12336043	eng	Let's all learn French.
12336045	eng	Let's practice our French.
12336046	eng	We're practicing our French.
12336097	eng	I'd just run away.
12336115	eng	We have forgotten everything.
12336118	eng	I have forgotten nothing.
12336120	eng	They have forgotten nothing.
12336124	eng	I have forgotten everything.
12336126	eng	She has forgotten everything.
12336153	eng	I feel terrific today.
12336157	eng	You should've advised me.
12336175	eng	Rush orders are expensive.
12336260	eng	I would've forgotten that.
12336380	eng	I feel incredibly sleepy.
12336544	eng	You really upset me.
12336653	eng	What's in your knapsack?
12336799	eng	Tom really appreciated that.
12337234	eng	Don't just trust anyone.
12337259	eng	Don't trust just anyone.
12337371	eng	Our guess was wrong.
12337495	eng	Tom has become soft.
12337585	eng	Will you come alone?
12337665	eng	My money is missing.
12337826	eng	Tom wanted us here.
12337934	eng	You should've waited longer.
12338002	eng	My efforts paid off.
12338095	eng	Tom had an emergency.
12338099	eng	The road is slick.
12338101	eng	Tom is a mendicant.
12338102	eng	I was a mendicant.
12338104	eng	Tom became a mendicant.
12338139	eng	I'm not misleading you.
12338140	eng	I'm not seducing you.
12338161	eng	She's buying medical cream.
12338191	eng	Which one is Tom's?
12338192	eng	I want warm water.
12338193	eng	Is this Tom's motorcycle?
12338197	eng	Tom continued taking pictures.
12338210	eng	Slick down your hair.
12338232	eng	I'd enjoy that immensely.
12338260	eng	Tom did that, right?
12338329	eng	I've lost my mobile.
12338333	eng	Have you been somewhere?
12338365	eng	This is unacceptable behaviour.
12338367	eng	This behaviour is unacceptable.
12338385	eng	It really is hot.
12338386	eng	I've just thrown up.
12338564	eng	I feel sleepy, too.
12338803	eng	I'd love that opportunity.
12338804	eng	Did you get frightened?
12339237	eng	You should've left sooner.
12339705	eng	Our parents got divorced.
12339734	eng	I like mineral water.
12339929	eng	She's afraid to fly.
12339930	eng	You're afraid to fly.
12339931	eng	I'm afraid to fly.

12340104	eng	You had two apples.
12340199	eng	I'll see myself out.
12340241	eng	I want to party.
12340298	eng	Tom has great hair.
12340299	eng	You should've already left.
12340323	eng	Did you get meat?
12340331	eng	Is the response affirmative?
12340353	eng	A convention was signed.
12340366	eng	Sonia's honor was stained.
12340412	eng	Did you get offended?
12340413	eng	Mary is a nanny.
12340416	eng	Mary is a babysitter.
12340455	eng	Welcome to our store.
12340463	eng	This state is legendary.
12340482	eng	Did you stop anywhere?
12340518	eng	You should've practiced more.
12340521	eng	It's such a turn-on.
12340527	eng	That'll make things complicated.
12340552	eng	Sadists are latent masochists.
12340572	eng	Our horse is losing.
12340644	eng	I'd like another doctor.
12341221	eng	Our lives are different.

12714400	eng	The children quieted down.
12714412	eng	He isn't alert anymore.
12714473	eng	You're thinner than Tom.
12715009	eng	He lost his teeth.
12715027	eng	Tom retracted his confession.
12715030	eng	Let Tom himself explain.
12715031	eng	Tom himself told me.
12715101	eng	Tom landed the plane.
12715105	eng	I got incredibly bored.
12715106	eng	Tom has a seizure.
12715119	eng	Tom might like this.
12715121	eng	Tom just drove off.
12715122	eng	Tom must be strong.
12715123	eng	Tom hit me again.
12715125	eng	Tom really is crazy.
12715130	eng	Tom needs police protection.
12715131	eng	Tom stole my car.
12715155	eng	Do you know Spanish?
12715462	eng	I came first home.
12715561	eng	We speak very quickly.
12715750	eng	Turn off the faucet!
12716098	eng	You bet your ass!
12716169	eng	They won't find us.
12716254	eng	Bodybuilders are Tom's type.
12716265	eng	This software is free.
12716339	eng	That's a big cat!
12716347	eng	We won't be found.
12716903	eng	Elephants have long noses.
12716906	eng	I bought three postcards.
12716941	eng	Did he forgive us?
12716948	eng	That sentence is redundant.
12716951	eng	He is naturally intelligent.
12717055	eng	Oh, what a beauty!
12717149	eng	Will you wash up?
12717151	eng	Are you washing up?
12717182	eng	You're most welcome here.
12717229	eng	The parcel is demaged.
12717355	eng	Tom gave up fighting.
12717392	eng	I'm not a waitress.
12717416	eng	For English, press 1.
12717494	eng	That's a taboo truth.
12717496	eng	That's an unshakeable truth.
12717521	eng	I saw the announcement.
12717524	eng	Are you paying them?
12718009	eng	Tom told me stories.
12718015	eng	Tom should come home.
12718019	eng	Tom works for himself.
12718028	eng	Tom did this himself.
12718133	eng	That's more than friendship.
12718139	eng	Did you finally understand?
12718145	eng	Humans can be monsters.
12718718	eng	I'm not a server.
12718796	eng	You mustn't disappoint Tom.
12719262	eng	You should be elsewhere.
12719267	eng	You should be excited.
12719268	eng	You should be expelled.
12719277	eng	You should be happier.
12719292	eng	That should be illegal.
12719302	eng	You should be inside.
12719317	eng	You should be demoted.
12719367	eng	You should add salt.
12719813	eng	Hallowed be thy name.
12719904	eng	Intentions don't excuse actions.
12720140	eng	That's a retouched photograph.
12720143	eng	This is my passion.
12720865	eng	Sometimes reality surpasses fiction.
12720949	eng	The roof is brown.
12720950	eng	I considered this valuable.
12721097	eng	People have forgotten me.
12721130	eng	They have forgotten you.
12722000	eng	I commited a crime.
12722044	eng	She arranged the flowers.
12722051	eng	The policeman runs quickly.
12722057	eng	People aren't seeing clearly.
12722063	eng	You can never generalize.
12722071	eng	Does he understand that?
12722103	eng	Nothing is coming back.
12722114	eng	He told you that.
12722115	eng	Give him the sandwich.

12722136	eng	Tom whistled to himself.
12723267	eng	Please look after him.
12723645	eng	We'll go by bike.
12723665	eng	Give her a sandwich.
12723667	eng	I'm meeting with her.
12723668	eng	I really liked parachuting.
12723931	eng	You should be packing.
12723935	eng	You should be practicing.
12723941	eng	Tom should be quarantined.
12723943	eng	You should be realistic.

12723972	eng	You should behave yourselves.
12723974	eng	You should believe us.
12723980	eng	You should both leave.
12723981	eng	You should bring Tom.
12724028	eng	You may forget that.
12724062	eng	That person acts quick.
12724311	eng	How about Thursday fortnight?
12724393	eng	Be a good neighbour.
12724692	eng	They're addicted to drugs.
12724941	eng	This house is hers.
12725123	eng	There's no better possibility.
12725286	eng	It's an endangered plant.
12725293	eng	Debt keeps piling up.
12725315	eng	Kill or be killed.
12725321	eng	Tom used this table.
12725349	eng	My parents say nothing!
12725373	eng	The room is nice.
12725427	eng	I like her smell.
12725429	eng	She didn't believe her.
12725437	eng	He invested in stocks.
12725449	eng	She brought her violin.
12726086	eng	Use the Russian dictionary.
12726091	eng	They traveled to Reims.
12726116	eng	Which team will play?
12726249	eng	Do not despise yourselves.
12726315	eng	Tom is free again.
12726356	eng	Working here is pleasant.
12726609	eng	Her back is wet.
12726610	eng	His back is wet.
12726909	eng	I don't dry them.
12727153	eng	Its price has trebled.
12727489	eng	Does he watch TV?
12727512	eng	Tom needs to fight.
12727636	eng	Did you eat them?
12727742	eng	The bucket is leaky.
12728040	eng	Learning Arabic is fun.
12728044	eng	That's not a restaurant.
12728050	eng	Our plane just landed.
12728101	eng	They dare to speak.
12728105	eng	To hell with them!
12728134	eng	We abandoned the city.

12728157	eng	Phone us this afternoon.
12728158	eng	Ring us this afternoon.
12728574	eng	Look! A baby centipede!
12728673	eng	I've been having fun.
12728691	eng	Aripiprazole can cause hypersexuality.
12729008	eng	It's a huge copout.
12729070	eng	This stone is flat.
12729073	eng	Skura is a woman.
12729203	eng	I can't hear you!
12729382	eng	Incels aren't necessarily virgins.
12729387	eng	Tom got arrested again.
12729424	eng	Is it something special?
12730005	eng	He's so intellectually bright.
12730228	eng	Johanna copied his sentence.
12730231	eng	Jeanne copied his sentence.
12730236	eng	Can Tom change it?
12730252	eng	Did she forgive you?
12730254	eng	Has she forgiven you?
12730323	eng	I'm suddenly getting smarter.
12730655	eng	I'm not the Messiah.
12730731	eng	I watched it religiously.
12730732	eng	I read the Bible.
12730746	eng	Tom's back on heroin.
12731036	eng	We don't look alike.
12731072	eng	I don't adore them.
12731073	eng	Your hair isn't black.
12731075	eng	Let's plant many trees!
12731076	eng	Does your wife agree?
12731078	eng	You won't drive tomorrow.
12731080	eng	My pen is good.
12732046	eng	You couldn't see him.
12732148	eng	The turtle is crawling.
12732164	eng	I seriously adore you.
12732166	eng	You're playing the fool.
12732169	eng	My shinbone was injured.
12732172	eng	We should thank her!
12732175	eng	I saw an otter.
12732177	eng	I'm a bit dissatisfied.
12732380	eng	Is there anyone missing?
12732394	eng	He remained my friend.
12732759	eng	I've got rotten egg.
12732760	eng	I have acid reflux.
12732822	eng	My ancestor was right.
12732834	eng	Spell it for me!
12732842	eng	I don't dislike school.
12732844	eng	But they still exist!
12732848	eng	You are very handsome.
12732952	eng	They cried and believed.
12732960	eng	Mary was lightly dressed.
12733048	eng	I gained 1.3 kilograms.
12733052	eng	I gained 2.9 pounds.
12733062	eng	They're of Czech nationality.
12733076	eng	He's such an idiot!
12733522	eng	The rumor spread immediately.
12733563	eng	Guess what that is.
12733564	eng	Guess what this is.
12733565	eng	Animals deserve our respect.
12733579	eng	But what a pity!
12733600	eng	Are the parents tired?
12734205	eng	Tom blew a raspberry.
12734743	eng	Come back home earlier!
12735080	eng	Tom will surely come.
12735083	eng	Tom must be compensated.
12735087	eng	Let's protect the forest.
12735089	eng	I don't find them.
12735098	eng	That is very bad!
12735101	eng	Give me an apple!
12735109	eng	Tom makes up stories.
12735111	eng	Tom said something else.
12735166	eng	People heard about him.
12735175	eng	Help yourselves with coffee.
12735399	eng	Tom needs to focus.
12735486	eng	I saw some otters.
12735715	eng	Maggots are baby flies.
12735832	eng	Don't open the door!
12737463	eng	He heard other stories.
12737566	eng	I have cold hands.
12737686	eng	Thanks for asking, Tom.
12737709	eng	Tom brought his guitar.
12738386	eng	The refrigerator doesn't work.
12738709	eng	We'll arrive around noon.
12739169	eng	You should come downstairs.
12739619	eng	He escaped my hands.
12739622	eng	We escaped their hands.
12739634	eng	They talk about music.
12739665	eng	They talk about sports.
12739685	eng	They speak among themselves.
12739692	eng	You speak English well.
12739695	eng	You speak too fast.
12740139	eng	Were you at home?

12740705	eng	He made her breakfast.
12740736	eng	He hated it here.
12742178	eng	I drew a cat.
12742183	eng	Mary really likes animals.
12742188	eng	Mary hasn't left yet.
12742190	eng	Did you predict it?
12742195	eng	What's she singing about?
12742196	eng	What's he singing about?
12742785	eng	Please clear the way.

12744467	eng	The car won't move.
12744471	eng	Is the elevator working?
12744472	eng	That elevator isn't working.
12744541	eng	Put down your pistol.
12744542	eng	Unfortunately, nobody was close.
12744548	eng	That is a cenotaph.
12745635	eng	He joined the military.
12745658	eng	Tom has questionable beliefs.
12745668	eng	He entered the barn.
12745747	eng	Does he need anything?
12745752	eng	He can't have kids.
12745758	eng	He entered the store.

12745837	eng	He did multiple jobs.
12745916	eng	He accepted the money.
12745978	eng	He shopped every day.
12746090	eng	Leave the kid alone!
12747167	eng	I'm free right now.
12747180	eng	That buffet is noteworthy.
12747182	eng	Mary abandons her children.

12747186	eng	Someone stole my card.
12747348	eng	My mother went shopping.
12747356	eng	Is that Japanese food?
12747702	eng	Tom is a chameleon.
12747816	eng	Think about her feelings.
12747832	eng	How to measure success?

12752397	eng	Eat vegetables and fruits!
12752438	eng	What are names, anyway?
12752467	eng	I'm teaching them French.
