9305438	eng	It is a likely outcome.
9305662	eng	She began to get bored.
9305671	eng	Today I've covered six kilometres.
9305679	eng	I must confess: I lied.
9305820	eng	Which episode are you on?
9305824	eng	Don't be such an arsehole!
9305875	eng	We need to forget that.
9305931	eng	How can I forget this?
9305954	eng	We also assess analytical ability.
9305958	eng	He got to sleep in.
9305961	eng	I am better than her.
9305974	eng	Tom is an art historian.
9305980	eng	Are you coming on Saturday?
9305986	eng	Shall we get a beer?
9306040	eng	Hinduism is a polytheistic religion.
9306110	eng	I love him to death.
9306151	eng	She got pregnant with Tom.
9306156	eng	Everything could be so beautiful.
9306211	eng	Thomas isn't a pupil here.
9306305	eng	I enjoy watching him sleep.
9306336	eng	Dear children have many names.
9306342	eng	He was in the backseat.
9306357	eng	Are you ready for battle?
9306390	eng	He puffed out his chest.
9306392	eng	I filled up the tank.
9306449	eng	He has bad alcohol habits.
9306506	eng	I totally understand the feeling.
9306868	eng	We only have one key.
9307005	eng	I don't speak bald eagle.
9307053	eng	This skit is very funny.
9307115	eng	Tom is an odd character.
9307134	eng	How do you manage stress?
9307187	eng	He's deeply afraid of life.
9307510	eng	They tried to murder him.
9307539	eng	Make a note of it.
9307816	eng	Tom, how was your trip?
9307899	eng	Tom thinks she's a cat.
9307984	eng	He went a while ago.
9307997	eng	I tried on several occasions.
9308338	eng	Put this in your suitcase.
9308947	eng	Tom is the main suspect.
9308949	eng	We better not go now.
9309000	eng	It seemed obvious to me.
9309035	eng	I glanced around the room.
9309039	eng	He seemed friendly and compassionate.
9309040	eng	Bring them here to me.
9309052	eng	I'm clumsier than you are.
9309283	eng	Did they kick you out?
9309691	eng	Tom is fixing his car.
9309967	eng	Tom thinks he's a knight.
9309972	eng	Tom ate his own shoe.
9310047	eng	I never did it before.
9310131	eng	I can't fix the appliances.
9310197	eng	You've lost me. It's over.

9311827	eng	Do you like spring rolls?
9312014	eng	It's time to end this.
9312041	eng	Was everything Tom said true?
9312434	eng	They shook like aspen leaves.
9312469	eng	The success exceeded all expectations.
9312514	eng	Where did he learn Armenian?
9312564	eng	This honey is very thick.
9312811	eng	Did you wash the vegetables?
9313076	eng	Be nice to old people.
9313713	eng	No one made a sound.
9314663	eng	Why would that be strange?
9314665	eng	There is no time left.
9314671	eng	I already thought as much.
9314708	eng	Do that today, if possible.
9314710	eng	Tom is stuck in Boston.
9314726	eng	Tom probably won't believe you.
9314734	eng	Why does caffeine help headaches?
9314755	eng	He didn't collect enough evidence.
9314764	eng	I feel like a failure.
9314829	eng	Tom is a lousy photographer.
9314893	eng	Math is hard for me.

9314932	eng	Our hotel faces the beach.
9314933	eng	Our hotel faces the ocean.
9314936	eng	My room faces the street.
9315030	eng	Tom is a poor driver.
9315082	eng	What's your name and address?
9315259	eng	Not everyone succeeds in life.
9315311	eng	My knife has become dull.
9315394	eng	Our class has gotten bigger.
9315714	eng	How old is this wine?
9315727	eng	What should we do then?
9316022	eng	Tom is good at football.
9316958	eng	Help Tom down the stairs.
9316982	eng	Mary furiously stomped her foot.
9317024	eng	She wanted us to attack.
9317036	eng	She wanted Taninna to leave.
9317050	eng	She wanted some alone time.
9317058	eng	Is that what she wanted?
9317074	eng	We had what she wanted.
9317105	eng	Tell me what she wanted.
9317120	eng	She wanted to say something.
9317131	eng	She wanted to adopt you.
9317250	eng	This was in your drawer.
9317916	eng	This fills me with joy.
9317952	eng	Don't spend all your money.
9318036	eng	I always liked playing soccer.
9318040	eng	She was speaking French fluently.
9318511	eng	Wine is his only friend.
9319705	eng	We don't want to fight.
9321245	eng	Can you teach me Dutch?
9321263	eng	I speak a little Dutch.
9321281	eng	I can teach you Dutch.
9321299	eng	Where do they speak Dutch?
9321341	eng	They are teaching me Dutch.
9321361	eng	How do you learn Dutch?
9321366	eng	How do you teach Dutch?
9321643	eng	There can be only one.
9321659	eng	Do I have to leave?
9321745	eng	I'm staying up to date.
9321767	eng	Can you keep me posted?
9321768	eng	Tom is a known fascist.
9323298	eng	All the spots were taken.
9323395	eng	I was there last year.
9323396	eng	I was here last year.
9323406	eng	I think it's my favorite.
9323478	eng	Severe trauma makes things difficult.
9323531	eng	Her voice sounds really good.
9323533	eng	Tom is my youngest child.
9323546	eng	Tom hardly ever praises Mary.
9323547	eng	I believe Tom is weak.
9323552	eng	I sold Tom my bike.
9323560	eng	I can't see it clearly.
9323573	eng	Don't listen to Tom's lies.
9323583	eng	Tom is loud and domineering.
9323628	eng	Even the experts were wrong.
9323714	eng	I'll knock your teeth out.
9323729	eng	My ears didn't stop ringing.
9323756	eng	Give credit where credit's due.
9324030	eng	I hope we become friends.
9324151	eng	Yanni was wearing a bodysuit.
9324214	eng	Decide how much you want.
9324507	eng	Yanni has a plywood floor.
9324508	eng	Yanni is an easy scare.
9324514	eng	It was a clever ruse.
9324969	eng	What happened at school today?
9325298	eng	You should keep doing that.
9325305	eng	Did you hear of it?
9325307	eng	Have you heard of it?
9325310	eng	I never heard of it.
9325323	eng	I did hear about it.
9325487	eng	The car's brakes were cut.
9325652	eng	Do you play chess consistently?
9325743	eng	Can you dress this wound?
9325868	eng	I'd never eat a penguin.
9326432	eng	Don't you like your classes?
9327257	eng	Has anybody seen Tom today?
9327263	eng	Did anyone see Tom today?
9328035	eng	One and one is two.
9328148	eng	I'm a curly-haired, blue-eyed angel.
9328506	eng	We don't believe in ghosts.
9328758	eng	We must start right now.
9328780	eng	Has Tom come back yet?
9328857	eng	What is that guy's problem?
9328883	eng	You have to try harder.
9328886	eng	Why do people waste food?
9328902	eng	I can't tell the truth.
9328934	eng	Your parents will be worried.
9329118	eng	We're going to visit Germany.
9329662	eng	Can you prove Tom's guilt?
9329962	eng	I made a quick breakfast.
9329987	eng	These are better than those.
9330017	eng	Children have always liked you.
9330025	eng	You don't enjoy my jokes.
9330044	eng	I took him to school.
9330059	eng	I'd stay, but I can't.
9330063	eng	I'd go, but I can't.
9330072	eng	I'd come, but I can't.
9330197	eng	I'm talking and feeling well.
9330210	eng	He hates what he does.
9330212	eng	He loves me beyond reason.
9330230	eng	How did she do what?
9330262	eng	Sex and love are different.
9330332	eng	I managed to have sex!
9330339	eng	Tom is a decent person.
9330368	eng	I'm in a black house.
9330371	eng	We're in an unlit room.
9330394	eng	You talk like a man.
9330399	eng	Your car is really girly.
9330472	eng	I hope they shut up!
9330473	eng	I hope they stop talking!
9330512	eng	What do you find horrid?
9330521	eng	We should eat with her.
9330690	eng	I hit Tom in self-defense.
9330785	eng	I don't have a degree.
9330891	eng	Tom's very presence inspired Mary.
9330938	eng	Tom bought a chocolate bar.
9330964	eng	Tom has left a note.
9330977	eng	Why did you come alone?
9331018	eng	It hurts when I bite.
9331073	eng	Mary is a belly dancer.
9331086	eng	What'd you scratch me for?
9331101	eng	So how was your day?
9331112	eng	Why does blood taste metallic?
9331125	eng	Tom is studying music theory.
9331129	eng	They're just growing pains, Tom.
9331134	eng	Has anyone seen my badge?
9331152	eng	Let's sit at this table.
9331163	eng	They're not listening to me.
9331165	eng	Somebody's standing at the gate.
9331169	eng	Please write me a letter.
9331178	eng	Let's walk to the station.
9331179	eng	Please put out your cigarette.
9331184	eng	We went to different schools.
9331186	eng	She runs a flower shop.
9331320	eng	Tom has been so generous.
9331385	eng	I couldn't think of anything.
9331390	eng	How about we stop here?
9331404	eng	I can't pronounce that name.
9331430	eng	Yanni didn't speak any Berber.
9331469	eng	Skura's husband treated her abominably.
9331485	eng	The milk didn't taste right.
9331486	eng	Maybe the milk is spoiled.
9331489	eng	Yanni spat out the milk.
9331490	eng	Take this carton of milk.
9331493	eng	Yanni didn't finish his milk.
9331597	eng	Tom slept all day yesterday.
9331616	eng	Someone killed Tom in Boston.
9331619	eng	This is a string instrument.
9331670	eng	This is an eye socket.
9331672	eng	This can be summoned anywhere.
9331674	eng	I can sleep anywhere, anytime.
9331678	eng	Lots of people are about.
9331719	eng	Your room is quite minimalist.
9331740	eng	Yanni's children were completely filthy.
9331977	eng	Tom is watching his weight.
9332033	eng	He made my life miserable.
9332355	eng	That's just how it is.
9332792	eng	Please save this for me.
9332819	eng	The prices are still rising.
9333125	eng	He won't take this lightly.
9333230	eng	I seriously don't believe that.
9333232	eng	I really don't believe that.
9333242	eng	Stay away from my sister.
9333693	eng	It didn't last very long.
9333746	eng	This is no longer news.
9333895	eng	Are you a normal person?
9333910	eng	You confuse it with love.
9334058	eng	Nobody listens to that stuff.
9334187	eng	When does your class end?
9334192	eng	John passed despite barely studying.
9334270	eng	Everyone but me is busy.
9334337	eng	The Martians conquered the earth.
9334370	eng	Everyone except me is busy.
9334371	eng	Everyone is busy except me.
9334402	eng	We had to move away.
9334455	eng	Every human being is unique.
9334458	eng	Each human being is unique.
9334502	eng	Cleanliness is a health guarantee.
9334533	eng	Do you think it's right?
9334765	eng	Our white hairs are multiplying.
9334797	eng	He spoke on my behalf!
9335821	eng	He adopted that orphan boy.
9335824	eng	He adopted that orphaned boy.
9335826	eng	He adopted that orphan girl.
9335828	eng	He adopted that orphaned girl.
9336022	eng	He is eighty years old.
9336063	eng	Nobody here knows my name.
9336195	eng	You didn't do too badly.
9336277	eng	For now, this is enough.
9336303	eng	It isn't really that expensive.
9336308	eng	It isn't all that expensive.
9336423	eng	I shouldn't have gotten married.
9336478	eng	That'll be enough for now.
9336535	eng	That child soon fell asleep.
9336563	eng	That wasn't worth the trouble.
9336889	eng	Don't bother answering Tom's questions.
9336903	eng	Sorry, I'm in a hurry.
9336928	eng	Which of these is unnecessary?
9336938	eng	Tom is smart, but lazy.
9336959	eng	I watch TV after supper.
9337054	eng	Tom was the main suspect.
9337174	eng	Light doesn’t know of darkness.
9337195	eng	Do you obey your mother?
9337205	eng	I really don't like cockroaches.
9337228	eng	It rained hard all morning.
9337229	eng	It probably won't freeze tonight.
9337234	eng	Eventually, prices will go up.
9337238	eng	Look at that good-looking girl.
9337239	eng	Look at that good-looking woman.
9337240	eng	Look at that good-looking guy.
9337241	eng	Look at that good-looking man.
9337242	eng	Is this machine still usable?
9337244	eng	Is this all you have?
9337256	eng	Hello! My name is Bashir.
9337275	eng	Please turn your phones off.
9337289	eng	It won't make much difference.
9337299	eng	It was raining very hard.
9337300	eng	It was raining really hard.
9337335	eng	I buy and restore furniture.
9337350	eng	Tom has been collecting data.
9337420	eng	I feel stupid for asking.
9337428	eng	I saw what happened there.
9337501	eng	Do you still like me?
9337510	eng	What games does Tom like?
9337520	eng	Gradually, things are getting better.
9337557	eng	I don't need a receipt.
9337560	eng	We have what we need.
9337571	eng	Even coaches need a coach.
9337624	eng	Can I count on leniency?
9337654	eng	When does summer break start?
9337667	eng	We're glad to meet you.
9337682	eng	Tom called me to apologize.
9337930	eng	Everything is in God's hands.
9338031	eng	It smells good, doesn't it?
9338082	eng	Tell them who I am.
9338183	eng	Mary works as a secretary.
9338347	eng	How will this help us?
9338712	eng	When should I visit you?
9338810	eng	Yanni started using Skura's utensils.
9338951	eng	Yanni had a screaming fit.
9339108	eng	He read the poem aloud.
9339245	eng	We can go, can't we?
9339556	eng	Make them listen to you.
9339749	eng	I was suddenly left unemployed.
9340331	eng	Are you coming on Monday?
9340400	eng	Do you still believe them?
9340516	eng	I'm hungry as a hog.
9340599	eng	Tom cheats all the time.
9340817	eng	Who's having sex with who?
9340863	eng	Please don't sing with me.
9340894	eng	Please give him this table.
9340948	eng	Tom fed the stray dog.
9341105	eng	It does look like it.
9341111	eng	How can you prove it?
9341141	eng	The door has been barricaded.
9341154	eng	Tom beat me to it.
9341251	eng	We hid in the bushes.
9341372	eng	Who doesn't know the problem!
9341373	eng	Why does the UN exist?
9341451	eng	Where is Tom going now?
9341490	eng	I fully opened the door.
9341549	eng	He has trouble saying no.
9341576	eng	Tom is upset about something.
9341596	eng	How do I get started?
9341602	eng	Is this a good idea?
9341620	eng	How do I study best?
9341661	eng	When should I be there?
9341677	eng	I am trying my best.
9341715	eng	It's very smoky in there.
9341805	eng	Mary is really very beautiful.
9341832	eng	Tom is a lousy cook.
9341954	eng	He speaks very good Creole.
9342068	eng	Mary is a selfish woman.
9342076	eng	Racism is still with us.
9342130	eng	This is your civic duty.
9342731	eng	Tom is a Canadian laborer.
9343022	eng	Throw this out for me.

9343943	eng	They are very greedy people.
9343961	eng	Don't come in my room.
9344011	eng	I've never seen Tom performing.
9344137	eng	I couldn't attend the ceremony.
9344150	eng	Doing that was very hard.
9344152	eng	Doing that was very difficult.
9344168	eng	I don't really like cheese.
9344207	eng	Tom is folding the towels.
9344337	eng	Tom, do you play chess?
9344389	eng	Tom pulled on the rope.
9344463	eng	Stay with me for now.
9344525	eng	I hear you've been sick.
9344550	eng	Let's go see the game.
9344589	eng	I constantly think of you.

9344798	eng	Did you enjoy your vacation?
9344799	eng	When will this be done?

9344900	eng	Bullying will not be tolerated.
9344925	eng	Big men aren't always strong.
9344942	eng	I waited for this day.
9344945	eng	A snowslide blocked the road.
9344952	eng	Come and look at this.
9344957	eng	I'm not leading you there.
9344961	eng	It's interesting to watch babies.
9344962	eng	Please be back by 2:30.
9344969	eng	I am not educating them.
9344973	eng	You come tomorrow as well!
9344977	eng	Hello! How are you feeling?
9344981	eng	I decided to study Kanji.
9344985	eng	I am calling the police!
9344993	eng	The noble has many lands.

9400903	eng	You owe me one, Tom.
9400911	eng	They go to cultural encounters.
9400915	eng	We're always short on money.
9400920	eng	Where's this from, my girl?
9400930	eng	The purse has a hole.
9400933	eng	Anyways, that's not that important.
9400947	eng	I see obstacles as challenges.
9400965	eng	They made me learn Spanish.
9401002	eng	Life went on as usual.
9401081	eng	Did you water the flowers?
9401101	eng	Did you draw that yourself?
9401139	eng	She didn't pass the test.
9401142	eng	Will you come back later?
9401187	eng	Oh, I have no idea!
9401193	eng	What was going on there?
9401237	eng	Tom was thrown into prison.
9401261	eng	Do you accept my terms?
9401333	eng	We almost had a fight.
9401571	eng	Welcome to our new home.
9401596	eng	Tom chickened out and retreated.
9401631	eng	You aren't kidding, are you?
9401869	eng	Don't speak till spoken to.
9401895	eng	Even cake shops are closed!
9401916	eng	He took over this school.
9401922	eng	Obviously, Tom had no proof.
9401968	eng	Hold on! Success is close!
9401978	eng	The room lighting is sufficient.
9401981	eng	You're just like a fool!
9401997	eng	He scored an own goal.
9402014	eng	Yanni spoke highly of Skura.
9402016	eng	Yanni wasn't from the area.
9402028	eng	Yanni's stalking gave Skura nightmares.
9402029	eng	Are you home tomorrow afternoon?
9402034	eng	Yanni drove to that location.
9402045	eng	Yanni glanced at the mosque.
9402052	eng	Yanni has a production company.
9402079	eng	Yanni camped in the woods.
9402082	eng	Yanni did it multiple times.
9402089	eng	Yanni sat outside Skura's house.
9402096	eng	Yanni took the opposite direction.
9402104	eng	Yanni brought some can food.
9402113	eng	Yanni camped in his yard.
9402117	eng	Yanni's house was barely visible.
9402130	eng	Yanni visited an abandoned church.
9402146	eng	Yanni didn't use a flashlight.
9402179	eng	Yanni was given a raise.
9402180	eng	Yanni kept the store open.
9402228	eng	Tom doesn't believe me anymore.
9402476	eng	Are you sure it's them?
9402866	eng	That isn't a bad option.
9403022	eng	Well, it's time to go.
9403090	eng	What shall I tell him?
9403406	eng	Tom doesn't have bad grades.
9403530	eng	Does anyone else feel hot?
9403917	eng	He thought for a moment.
9404110	eng	Tom did this, not that.
9404429	eng	Who's coming to the party?
9404522	eng	Tom hesitated in the doorway.
9404542	eng	It's all on the house!
9404581	eng	Tom is a malevolent person.
9404586	eng	I'm responsible for this mistake.
9404930	eng	Tom just signed the contract.
9405387	eng	You were flying too low.
9405476	eng	Have you ever taught chemistry?
9405611	eng	I'm fed up with lies.
9405760	eng	Tom doesn't meditate at all.
9405852	eng	Who gave you these sunglasses?
9406038	eng	It's cold in my room.
9406268	eng	Life isn't just about work.
9407101	eng	Did you find your parents?
9407476	eng	Lock Tom in the cell.
9407620	eng	Tom took some unnecessary risks.
9407667	eng	Everything seemed wrong to Tom.
9407815	eng	Get away from my car.
9407871	eng	I kept missing his calls.
9407896	eng	I turned my ringer off.
9407909	eng	Live with us for now.
9407984	eng	Add three tablespoons of salt.
9407987	eng	There's no one with us.
9407995	eng	I looked up at him.
9408017	eng	Tom couldn't hide his concern.
9408084	eng	My father began to snore.
9408086	eng	We haven't done it yet.
9408093	eng	Did you like that play?
9408171	eng	That was just an excuse.
9408295	eng	Tom tried to appear relaxed.
9408302	eng	What do you want, boy?
9408305	eng	You can't always be lucky.
9408322	eng	I don't think I agree.
9408348	eng	You have to be strict.
9408349	eng	I'm so glad you're safe.
9408350	eng	I'm glad that you're safe.
9408376	eng	What do you have planned?
9408474	eng	That was the final blow.
9408481	eng	I like drizzles, not rainstorms.
9408521	eng	Sorry. I'm in a hurry.
9408523	eng	Tom dozed on the sofa.
9408529	eng	They are wearing couple socks.
9408559	eng	It is time to morph!
9408614	eng	It wasn't so much fun.
9408633	eng	She came to the bedroom.
9408636	eng	How can we lower costs?
9408640	eng	I knew you'd be furious.
9408646	eng	There's enough space for everyone.
9408653	eng	Why don't you like it?
9408656	eng	We weren't treated as equals.
9408669	eng	Let's play a video game.
9408672	eng	Don't ask Tom that question.
9408675	eng	We took dance lessons together.
9408678	eng	Is that one for sale?
9408689	eng	That's the way Tom talks.
9408696	eng	Tom doesn't like lazy people.
9408697	eng	Have you weighed yourself today?
9408718	eng	Who gave you that idea?
9408724	eng	Why do we need this?
9408734	eng	The list is as follows:
9408741	eng	Is the rain to blame?
9408743	eng	I am going to shoot!
9408751	eng	Who is on your table?
9408754	eng	Lend it to me too!
9408760	eng	I ate yoghurt this morning.
9408764	eng	I owe you forty dollars.
9408765	eng	I am reaching the climax.
9408776	eng	Do you like this show?
9408796	eng	The line stretched four blocks.
9408800	eng	Yanni started cursing in Berber.
9408805	eng	Yanni returned to his condo.
9408816	eng	Yanni returned from the restroom.
9408820	eng	Yanni still can't eat steak.
9408822	eng	How can you doubt me?
9408825	eng	He suffers from acute anxiety.
9408831	eng	The other half is yours.
9408834	eng	Why don't you come home?
9408841	eng	Are you with another girl?
9408846	eng	There is no explanation necessary.
9408862	eng	You're a very smart boy.
9409064	eng	We don't need you yet.
9409205	eng	Did you write everything down?
9409314	eng	Where do the Jacksons live?
9409334	eng	The party has been postponed.
9409465	eng	Her birthday is coming up.
9409480	eng	Yanni stood by the door.
9409497	eng	Yanni stoked Skura's hair softly.
9409519	eng	My car is always dirty.
9409557	eng	Will we see you tonight?
9409562	eng	It will make you think.
9409563	eng	She saw a better tomorrow.
9409578	eng	I will call you later.
9409579	eng	It won't get any better.
9409585	eng	I opened the window slightly.
9409601	eng	This is my history notebook.
9409602	eng	Then give me two more!
9409649	eng	All the windows are locked.
9409672	eng	What does it matter now?
9409715	eng	He tilted his head sideways.
9409731	eng	Of course I forgive you.
9409849	eng	Damn, did you see that?
9409968	eng	Did you buy the cellphone?
9409973	eng	Can we talk tomorrow morning?
9410160	eng	Did you go somewhere today?
9410184	eng	Get some rest, my dear.
9410266	eng	It was a joint decision.
9410483	eng	We're starting a new life.
9410616	eng	What's that tune you're humming?
9410752	eng	Tom is a versatile musician.
9411021	eng	Tom thinks Mary is boring.
9411026	eng	Mary thinks Tom is boring.
9411102	eng	Who else has a key?
9411253	eng	Tom is harvesting his corn.
9411309	eng	It was a dismal failure.
9411535	eng	Tom's bike was very expensive.
9411655	eng	The tank is almost full.
9411963	eng	Our band needs another guitarist.
9412081	eng	What else do you drink?
9412418	eng	It'll get hot here soon.
9412447	eng	Tom works at a library.
9412721	eng	The creek had red water.
9412743	eng	I think Tom passed out.
9413014	eng	Catch them if you can.
9413302	eng	I completely forgot about it.
9413309	eng	Tom never drinks green tea.
9413326	eng	Who lent you that book?
9413364	eng	Let's order something to eat.
9413626	eng	My hobby is my aquarium.
9413883	eng	As expected, Tom wasn't there.
9413905	eng	We were frozen with fear.
9414104	eng	What's up with your arm?
9414105	eng	What's wrong with your arm?
9414143	eng	Did you enjoy the meeting?
9414192	eng	Can you delete my account?
9414197	eng	I'm really sorry to hear.
9414218	eng	Everyone was waiting for Tom.
9414219	eng	Maybe no one will notice.
9414244	eng	Oddly enough, Tom was right.
9414249	eng	I would like to participate.
9414257	eng	I've got a terrible cough.
9414263	eng	Dissent has become a commodity.
9414264	eng	We ended up on Mars.
9414305	eng	I might have COVID again.
9414318	eng	Tom didn't do the reading.
9414335	eng	I no longer feel guilty.
9414350	eng	Tom's cat is a calico.
9414387	eng	It wasn't cold that night.
9414417	eng	That won't likely be possible.
9414426	eng	Isn't it time for dinner?
9414433	eng	How long did you sleep?
9414443	eng	We have to be strict.
9414471	eng	Everything came easy for Tom.
9414510	eng	Did they feed you anything?
9414515	eng	Has the dog been fed?
9414518	eng	Has anyone fed the dog?
9414519	eng	Has anybody fed the dog?
9414536	eng	Tom, it seems, doesn't care.
9414544	eng	There are no cats here.
9414545	eng	There aren't any cats here.
9414591	eng	Everything here belongs to us.
9414609	eng	Why aren't your children here?
9414623	eng	Tom won't do anything today.
9414630	eng	Did Tom attend the meeting?
9414645	eng	Are you coming home soon?
9414663	eng	Did they keep their promise?
9414669	eng	Gorillas very rarely climb trees.
9414671	eng	Has the game already started?
9414672	eng	It was a chilling story.
9414705	eng	It's clear Tom isn't interested.
9414742	eng	Go back to your rooms.
9414750	eng	Will you ever get married?
9414757	eng	Did you pass your test?
9414758	eng	I should've gone before Tom.
9414774	eng	I don't feel guilty anymore.
9414798	eng	Do you like this house?
9414804	eng	Has Tom proposed to you?
9414828	eng	We must win this war.
9414831	eng	If necessary, I'll come soon.
9414836	eng	I'll come by all means.
9414852	eng	How did it all start?
9414868	eng	Skura barely spoke any Berber.
9414880	eng	Tom rarely raises his voice.
9414881	eng	Does this often happen here?
9414899	eng	Is there such a rule?
9414934	eng	Hangzhou is a beautiful city.
9414969	eng	Yanni began to relieve himself.
9414976	eng	I have a busy life.
9414978	eng	The dentist checked my teeth.
9415000	eng	Maria has not eaten anything.
9415001	eng	Let's sing the Belarusian song!
9415033	eng	Tom is a renowned lexicographer.
9415115	eng	Yanni's dog ate the scorpion.
9415119	eng	Tom cleared his throat loudly.
9415120	eng	Yanni always wears long pants.
9415127	eng	Yanni is a novice driver.
9415175	eng	Prepare yourself for a shock.
9415261	eng	Did you see the fireworks?
9415276	eng	It isn't far by car.
9415278	eng	Tom tried to look relaxed.
9415304	eng	I enjoy studying with Tom.
9415311	eng	My afternoon was very busy.
9415326	eng	Don't be too confident, Tom.
9415351	eng	Even jokes have a limit.
9415358	eng	His name is very beautiful.
9415467	eng	Tom is a shady character.
9415517	eng	You always surprise me, Tom.
9415535	eng	He criticizes everyone and everything.
9415545	eng	Tom's voice is very beautiful.
9415548	eng	She was weeping bitter tears.
9415554	eng	It'll be warmer next week.
9415618	eng	We'll meet with Tom tomorrow.
9415699	eng	It helped me find myself.
9415714	eng	Maybe Tom went to Boston.
9415734	eng	Don't sit in the sun.
9415743	eng	Tom was already really drunk.
9415773	eng	Have you seen my mom?
9415783	eng	The university has a cafeteria.
9415786	eng	Who cares if Tom wins.
9415797	eng	Did you go anywhere today?
9415829	eng	Turn off the car engine.
9415851	eng	Tom is having pre-wedding jitters.
9415861	eng	Why are you saying this?
9415974	eng	Tom worries about his future.
9415994	eng	Did you get a scholarship?
9416019	eng	We have a common enemy.
9416077	eng	There are too many warriors.
9417231	eng	Tom won't go anywhere anyway.
9417269	eng	You're such a silly kitty!
9417886	eng	I deserve better than that.
9417964	eng	This one would be enough.
9417975	eng	I'm watching a Western movie.
9418001	eng	Who did they come with?
9418023	eng	I think you're spoiling Tom.
9418039	eng	Throw it in the trash.
9418058	eng	Tom took several unnecessary risks.
9418251	eng	My mom likes to cook.
9418344	eng	You need to walk more.
9418374	eng	Is that a polar bear?
9418508	eng	This game is so nostalgic.
9418521	eng	What happened to the bus?
9418603	eng	I think Tom is schizophrenic.
9418618	eng	Did you weigh yourself yesterday?
9418686	eng	We'll all stay here together.
9418690	eng	Tom had difficulty getting up.
9418695	eng	Did that happen yesterday, too?
9418711	eng	I'll tell Tom everything myself.
9418741	eng	They threw Tom into prison.
9418754	eng	Who's waiting for us downstairs?
9418757	eng	Tom's got some dank nugs.
9418762	eng	It was an overt provocation.
9418768	eng	Who told you to stop?
9418776	eng	I call my knife "Tom."
9418815	eng	Can you come right now?
9418827	eng	Where am I right now?
9418842	eng	Fold the paper in half.
9418865	eng	Let Tom tell the story.
9418906	eng	Lightning flashed in the sky.
9418929	eng	It may not be easy.
9418946	eng	Why did you call them?
9418985	eng	Tom said he'd call back.
9419004	eng	I should've left before Tom.
9419021	eng	Who else came with you?
9419065	eng	There's nobody in the pool.
9419072	eng	We're not very good singers.
9419092	eng	Tom's house is falling apart.
9419101	eng	How fast can you read?
9419192	eng	Are antibiotics effective against acne?
9419233	eng	Stop bullying the weak Jennifer!
9419247	eng	Have you watered the flowers?
9419250	eng	Her performance is really good.
9419260	eng	Skin and debone the fish.
9419261	eng	When will the stock arrive?
9419275	eng	Let's go drink a cup.
9419310	eng	He wrote a children's book.
9419316	eng	I'm alright, I'm just busy.
9419323	eng	How do we stop this?
9419331	eng	The doctor examined my brain.
9419335	eng	We have three hours left.
9419339	eng	Have you checked your email?
9419353	eng	There followed a lively debate.
9419368	eng	Congratulations on getting your degree!
9419369	eng	Congratulations on earning your degree!
9419379	eng	I'm made up about it.
9419381	eng	He's sicked it all up.
9419383	eng	He sicked it all up.
9419384	eng	Tom stole my ballpoint pen.
9419396	eng	Did you hear the shooting?
9419404	eng	Prices will go up soon.
9419410	eng	It is not a game.
9419443	eng	Tom speaks almost perfect French.
9419446	eng	Cut the apple into cubes.
9419448	eng	Tom often loses money gambling.
9419473	eng	Tom built a fallout shelter.
9419478	eng	I'm not sure Tom understands.
9419490	eng	Who doesn't like to win?
9419492	eng	We'll make a decision tomorrow.
9419494	eng	Well, how are we doing?
9419540	eng	We almost never have guests.
9419550	eng	What bothers you about him?
9419573	eng	I knew it wasn't normal.
9419585	eng	The Tuaregs gutted the camel.
9419586	eng	Tom looked at me disapprovingly.
9419590	eng	It was a powerful moment.
9419611	eng	Altan is a big-time schmuck.
9419638	eng	Altan is a huge pushover.
9419639	eng	Altan is a huge idiot.
9419653	eng	How will that help us?
9419674	eng	Some people must be friendzoned.
9419677	eng	Can you tie me up?
9419691	eng	What did they find out?
9419703	eng	Please read out page 49.
9419719	eng	I couldn't resist Tom's charm.
9419730	eng	We were worrying about Tom.
9419734	eng	Tom climbed the ladder slowly.
9419746	eng	I have read some books.
9419751	eng	I live in the capital.
9419760	eng	Didn't Tom attend the meeting?
9419768	eng	Come here and join us.
9419772	eng	This doesn't apply to you.
9419788	eng	Have you been to Rome?
9419811	eng	Tom seemed very strange today.
9419877	eng	Tom wasn't guilty of anything.
9419886	eng	We've already spoken to Tom.
9419900	eng	Is it usually cold here?
9419903	eng	We're going to solve this.
9419965	eng	Did you find your brother?
9419981	eng	Why don't you like skiing?
9420024	eng	Is spinach good for you?
9420033	eng	Tom prudently closed the door.
9420036	eng	Did you like anything there?
9420126	eng	Do you like my phone?
9420131	eng	You must leave on time.
9420136	eng	Tom worked like everyone else.
9420148	eng	Is everything all right now?
9420435	eng	Will you buy me that?
9420466	eng	Try to arrive on time.
9420613	eng	Who drank all the beer?
9420688	eng	Did you bring your notes?
9420790	eng	I have corrected several sentences.
9421179	eng	You'll pay dearly for it!
9421190	eng	Tom opened up a shop.
9421304	eng	Tom didn't like this picture.
9421977	eng	Everyone loved Tom very much.
9422176	eng	Do you have enough paper?
9422340	eng	Tom wanted to try skydiving.
9422423	eng	The race was a disaster.
9422448	eng	It's a very contagious virus.
9422453	eng	You have a new notification.
9422456	eng	Please confirm your email address.
9422571	eng	Thank you all for participating.
9422589	eng	A native corrected my mistakes.
9422612	eng	Where is the bandits' lair?
9422642	eng	What medications are you on?
9422696	eng	We should tell Tom everything.
9422700	eng	Am I a cute kid?
9422705	eng	We won't agree to that.
9422866	eng	Where will Tom spend Christmas?
9422877	eng	Tom's bedroom window was ajar.
9422887	eng	What can you offer me?
9422935	eng	Tom found a treasure map.
9422953	eng	Take care of my children.
9422954	eng	I was tricked by Tom.

9422982	eng	I was comforted by Tom.
9422983	eng	I was contacted by Tom.
9422988	eng	I was threatened by Tom.

9422995	eng	Don't play with my toys.
9423003	eng	I was interrupted by Tom.
9423007	eng	I was overpowered by Tom.
9423011	eng	I was congratulated by Tom.
9423027	eng	I was rejected by Tom.
9423032	eng	I'm being helped by Tom.
9423038	eng	I'm being blackmailed by Tom.
9423042	eng	It's best to forget it.
9423050	eng	Tom hasn't been helping me.
9423070	eng	I was defended by Tom.
9423073	eng	I was misunderstood by Tom.
9423105	eng	We agreed with his plan.
9423107	eng	We agreed with Tom's plan.
9423127	eng	Tom got hurt playing football.
9423136	eng	You should've asked Tom then.
9423161	eng	Tom loves to photograph food.
9423162	eng	Can I pay you tomorrow?
9423202	eng	Tom shouldn't drink at all.
9423205	eng	Do you know Morse code?
9423212	eng	Can you defuse the bomb?
9423225	eng	Who drank all the juice?
9423228	eng	Nobody expected this from Tom.
9423237	eng	Not all students like sports.
9423283	eng	Why don't we help you?
9423292	eng	When will they give up?
9423297	eng	OK, I'll see you tomorrow.
9423390	eng	Tom loudly cleared his throat.
9423412	eng	That's not a bad option.
9423417	eng	It rained three days straight.
9423639	eng	When will we do that?
9423658	eng	We all learned a little.
9423669	eng	Did you buy a cake?
9423684	eng	Yanni's life depends on it.
9423704	eng	The music calmed Tom down.
9423721	eng	What's physically wrong with Yanni?
9423746	eng	Was this supposed to happen?
9423749	eng	The bus was painfully slow.
9423776	eng	Tomorrow we have a test.
9424083	eng	Have you written everything down?
9424407	eng	Tom is allegedly sober now.
9424530	eng	They're both staring at me.
9424567	eng	I'm ticklish behind my knees.
9424599	eng	Tom doesn't wait for anyone.
9424614	eng	Do you still work there?
9424648	eng	Pensioners also lambasted the measures.
9424700	eng	Make sure Tom doesn't escape.
9424957	eng	This is what we feared.
9425034	eng	Did you enjoy the play?
9425047	eng	The Tuaregs disemboweled the camel.
9425571	eng	The windows were boarded up.
9425650	eng	Tom rappelled down the wall.
9425662	eng	Who'll pay for the loss?
9425828	eng	We have announced our affair.
9425989	eng	She almost felt like fainting.
9426139	eng	Can't you be more polite?
9426145	eng	He's an object of bullying.
9426268	eng	Do you communicate with Tom?
9426515	eng	The store was very crowded.
9426746	eng	Children don't like the school.
9426848	eng	Who lived in that house?
9426866	eng	I'll tell them we're ready.
9426947	eng	I texted Tom yesterday morning.
9427001	eng	After supper, Tom fell asleep.
9427003	eng	I couldn't sleep standing up.
9427006	eng	It was a terrible match.
9427008	eng	I dozed off a little.
9427035	eng	He's a former army officer.
9427066	eng	It was worth the money.
9427183	eng	How hot is the water?
9429576	eng	What business do you have?
9429618	eng	He wants to be punished.
9429836	eng	I will kick you away.
9430214	eng	Mennad spent six days here.
9430224	eng	We can't drop our guard.
9430257	eng	He's a very straightforward person.
9430261	eng	When is Hanukkah this year?
9430458	eng	This year has been special.
9430506	eng	Don't take off your gloves.
9430509	eng	Try not to get closer.
9431072	eng	Skeptics have doubts about everything.
9431172	eng	Don't generalize your personal problems.
9431255	eng	Treat him as an adult.
9431326	eng	They needed information he had.
9431555	eng	You're calling me an extremist?
9431681	eng	Tom said he wasn't scared.
9431773	eng	Does Tom really live here?
9431810	eng	I've been feeling very lonely.
9431826	eng	See what they are doing.
9431865	eng	We won't see Tom anymore.
9431896	eng	Don't tell anybody about this.
9431902	eng	Where else should we look?
9431903	eng	Dr. Jackson isn't my doctor.
9431965	eng	Is what they said true?
9432036	eng	Tom was among those arrested.
9432081	eng	The trip was a success.
9432179	eng	French is a required subject.
9432198	eng	French isn't a required subject.
9432236	eng	Guess who this letter's from.
9432249	eng	There's nobody in the classroom.
9432252	eng	They caught the lion alive.
9432256	eng	They demolished the old building.
9432267	eng	The schedule has been revised.
9432268	eng	The schedule has been changed.
9432271	eng	That'll be easy to check.
9432282	eng	Did you agree with Tom?
9432295	eng	That happened before the war.
9432394	eng	Should I pick you up?
9432404	eng	We still work with them.
9432453	eng	I have math after break.
9432462	eng	Do you also write music?
9432493	eng	We tried, but we failed.
9432558	eng	Have you discovered anything new?
9432643	eng	Have you seen the plunger?
9432653	eng	How's the nightlife in Boston?
9432656	eng	I kept reading the book.
9432660	eng	We sold that painting yesterday.
9432662	eng	I must finish this book.
9432719	eng	He does poorly in school.
9432726	eng	I'm just nitpicking, of course.
9432735	eng	I wish I could sing.
9432737	eng	There was nowhere to go.
9432739	eng	Tom moonlights as a hacktivist.
9432744	eng	Get out of my space.
9432763	eng	Yanni is an LGBT supporter.
9432766	eng	There's a hole in it.
9432784	eng	Don't let Tom tease Mary.
9432882	eng	Yanni has issues with women.
9432975	eng	Yanni would drink all day.
9432983	eng	Yanni got many merit badges.
9433200	eng	Next month will be October.
9433212	eng	Is there any other method?
9433792	eng	We have a deep connection.
9433892	eng	Where were those pictures taken?
9434003	eng	Now you can sign up.
9434006	eng	I'll be there at five.
9434148	eng	Their language is only Kabyle.
9434162	eng	You loaned it to me.
9434181	eng	They hum poems in Kabyle.
9434208	eng	May God have their souls.
9434355	eng	How do I make pancakes?
9434356	eng	How do you make pancakes?
9434724	eng	Tom is living a fantasy.
9434816	eng	I attended a military college.
9434937	eng	It was a real tragedy.
9434946	eng	That house over there's mine.
9434962	eng	I thought Tom lived here.
9434965	eng	We didn't see that coming.
9434970	eng	Tom hit me without warning.
9434988	eng	Tom never really loved you.
9434990	eng	What color is your belt?
9435000	eng	It won't get any worse.
9435014	eng	When will you give up?
9435022	eng	Please call me back later.
9435037	eng	There's almost no time left.
9435080	eng	Some murders are carefully planned.
9435081	eng	Tom likes watching soap operas.
9435085	eng	Did you keep your promise?
9435088	eng	Did you keep your promises?
9435095	eng	People around here speak French.
9435115	eng	What if they don't come?
9435120	eng	This car is for sale.
9435124	eng	My dog barks at strangers.
9435126	eng	We went to bed early.
9435131	eng	Do my paintings inspire you?
9435133	eng	I helped Tom prepare dinner.
9435142	eng	Tom said he speaks French.
9435147	eng	Who would know the answer?
9435150	eng	Does anybody ever visit you?
9435151	eng	Does anyone ever visit you?
9435200	eng	Don't worry, I shan't forget.
9435207	eng	They married not long ago.
9435222	eng	Is Tom's French any good?
9435286	eng	He's a talented chess player.
9435288	eng	Do you still have coffee?
9435298	eng	Do you still have beer?
9435337	eng	Tom wouldn't dare tell Mary.
9435347	eng	Tom started coughing up blood.
9435387	eng	The coals are still glowing.
9435388	eng	The embers are still glowing.
9435403	eng	Is the cloth particularly absorbent?
9435404	eng	Is that cloth particularly absorbent?
9435405	eng	This cloth is unusually absorbent.
9435469	eng	Guess who's written to me!
9435470	eng	Guess who's written to me.
9435478	eng	Don't take your gloves off.
9435491	eng	She was feeling all alone.
9435495	eng	There weren't any seats left.
9435500	eng	A pianist lives below us.
9435512	eng	It was perfect harvest weather.
9435521	eng	She knows about such things.
9435526	eng	They know about such things.
9435531	eng	You know about such things.
9435584	eng	He leaves everything to chance.
9435593	eng	I'm away for a fortnight.
9435596	eng	I'm away for two weeks.
9435600	eng	It's two kilometres from here.
9435613	eng	Dad is writing a letter.
9435614	eng	Dad's just writing a letter.
9435637	eng	Did you buy dog food?
9435703	eng	Tom is addicted to gambling.
9435724	eng	Let's meet in the lobby.
9435736	eng	Why is Tom so stubborn?
9435752	eng	Everybody loves Tom very much.
9436223	eng	Nobody can disrupt true friendship.
9436225	eng	Tom stepped over the threshold.
9436226	eng	So, what's on our agenda?
9436622	eng	Tom was a good-natured man.
9436720	eng	We didn't see it coming.
9436760	eng	We submitted our applications separately.
9436896	eng	What a dreamer you are.
9437020	eng	Now leave Tom to himself.
9437063	eng	Tom has the last word.
9437097	eng	We decided not to go.
9437175	eng	Tom should do this immediately.
9437184	eng	Did you write that note?
9437245	eng	Nobody remembered where Tom lived.
9437304	eng	Whose turn is it now?
9437588	eng	Why don't you want it?
9437788	eng	He's a garbage human being.
9437818	eng	Tom forced himself to laugh.
9437886	eng	Everybody knows it wasn't Tom.
9438107	eng	Tom didn't send any messages.
9438309	eng	Where do we find ourselves?
9438351	eng	This branch employs 20 associates.
9438369	eng	They immediately called the police.
9438413	eng	Tom spent the day writing.
9438431	eng	Why is this so hot?
9439030	eng	Thomas's stomach is hurting him.
9439032	eng	I am scared of that.
9439137	eng	Our cat's name is Cookie.
9439409	eng	Tom doesn't leave the house.
9439414	eng	Was that supposed to happen?
9439530	eng	Tom works as an acupuncturist.
9439567	eng	What's Tom forgotten this time?
9439617	eng	Tom just left for Australia.
9439629	eng	Tom nodded and turned away.
9439667	eng	We should wait for them.
9439703	eng	You need to get tested.
9439769	eng	Why wouldn't they help us?
9439780	eng	Tom says I'm his girlfriend.
9439785	eng	I was following Tom's instructions.
9439786	eng	Tom bit his bottom lip.
9439792	eng	Tom has changed his will.
9439798	eng	Tom offered us a nightcap.
9439802	eng	That's a very strange family.
9439807	eng	Tom made my life miserable.
9439811	eng	I took Tom to school.
9439813	eng	Tom was a simple man.
9439832	eng	Tom just needs a hug.
9439836	eng	Tom saved me from drowning.
9439843	eng	I get home fairly late.
9439846	eng	Tom shot the security guard.
9439879	eng	I kissed Tom good night.
9439881	eng	Tom was in the backseat.
9439947	eng	What's in the news today?
9439949	eng	What's the temperature in Celsius?
9439956	eng	Everybody loved Tom very much.
9439970	eng	What's in the bottom drawer?
9439972	eng	I liked your suggestion best.
9439985	eng	Tom's threat shouldn't be ignored.
9439989	eng	Does anyone need my help?
9439994	eng	Get in the car quickly.
9440002	eng	It was an assassination attempt.
9440015	eng	What's Tom still doing there?
9440035	eng	Do you remember Tom's address?
9440050	eng	You know how Tom gets.
9440075	eng	Did you have an accomplice?
9440102	eng	We breathe the same air.
9440107	eng	We've even got colour television.
9440134	eng	Where is your washing machine?
9440135	eng	You're nowhere near being finished.
9440146	eng	Tom appeared in the doorway.
9440151	eng	Did they say anything else?
9440153	eng	The conductor lifted his baton.
9440154	eng	The conductor raised his baton.
9440155	eng	I can't find his address.
9440156	eng	I've mislaid my mobile again.
9440157	eng	I've mislaid my phone again.
9440259	eng	Would you please talk quieter?
9440270	eng	Has anyone got an idea?
9440303	eng	I've started to respect Tom.
9440312	eng	Pack your things and go.
9440313	eng	Pack your stuff and go.
9440317	eng	Our city is very pedestrian-friendly.
9440328	eng	That's for me? Thank you.
9440331	eng	That could have ended badly.
9440332	eng	That could have gone pear-shaped.
9440333	eng	Think first before you speak.
9440340	eng	It had to be said!
9440364	eng	What's Algeria's biggest private employers?
9440366	eng	Go for plenty of walks.
9440367	eng	Do a lot of walking.
9440372	eng	I'd like to order now.
9440376	eng	It hasn't yet been decided.
9440381	eng	I had just gone home.
9440385	eng	Tom keeps talking about you.
9440390	eng	Algeria's demographics are rapidly changing.
9440426	eng	Algeria has a social-style economy.
9440428	eng	Algeria has a socialist-style economy.
9440446	eng	Algeria's economy is taking off.
9440451	eng	Algeria needs private engineering schools.
9440455	eng	Algeria needs more engineering schools.
9440473	eng	Will Algeria's economy ever boom?
9440477	eng	She was the meeting's organiser.
9440480	eng	Algeria needs more skilled workers.
9440483	eng	Algeria's economy has made progress.
9440507	eng	Seven is a good number.
9440523	eng	When will Mary be going?
9440529	eng	She makes us delicious quiches.
9440549	eng	Everyone but Mark has arrived.
9440551	eng	Mark always gets up early.
9440578	eng	Who smashed the window yesterday?
9440592	eng	Our opinions are completely different.
9440595	eng	I still remember her name.
9440600	eng	Smiling, Tom took his leave.
9440629	eng	That concert lasted three hours.
9440642	eng	What Tom did wasn't appropriate.
9440688	eng	Don't bury it too deep.
9440704	eng	When will you be ready?
9440715	eng	We don't have enough yet.
9440723	eng	Tom carefully cleaned the car.
9440726	eng	What did they give you?
9440739	eng	The police caught Tom's killers.
9440744	eng	It's not a good look.
9440777	eng	The box is very heavy.
9440798	eng	We will compensate you well.
9440861	eng	Japanese is an incredible language.
9440908	eng	I have a terrible cough.
9440927	eng	All the cabins are locked.
9440928	eng	Historical materialism is a pseudoscience.
9440934	eng	Tom is such a kvetch.
9440965	eng	The box was very heavy.
9440968	eng	We're used to Tom's complaining.
9440996	eng	Does your dog have fleas?
9441045	eng	My computer is very old.
9441067	eng	When will they do that?
9441165	eng	Will Tom accept our proposal?
9441182	eng	Everything else is just philosophy.
9441210	eng	I should've graduated before Tom.
9441219	eng	Which way did they go?
9441302	eng	Malka's fursona is a cat.
9441917	eng	The noise was growing louder.
9441962	eng	Who wants to help us?
9442168	eng	Nobody can deny this fact.
9442322	eng	Why are flights so expensive?
9442396	eng	Can't Tom come with us?
9442411	eng	We had a dry summer.
9442496	eng	How old is your school?
9442669	eng	Turks and Kurds are brothers.
9442704	eng	Do you remember Tom's password?
9442806	eng	Tom went to boarding school.
9442847	eng	Tom is a sexy man.
9442979	eng	Well, it serves you right.
9443034	eng	I'm a cute kid, right?
9443070	eng	You could've just told him.
9443072	eng	You could've just told her.
9443077	eng	You could've just told them.
9443092	eng	Sweat beaded on Tom's forehead.
9443105	eng	That may be the answer.
9443170	eng	Where does the bus stop?
9443416	eng	Tom obediently obeyed my orders.
9443421	eng	Could you stay with me?
9443562	eng	I started to respect Tom.
9443589	eng	It wasn't a serious request.
9443591	eng	It isn't a serious request.
9443593	eng	It's not a serious request.
9443605	eng	I don't remember visiting Boston.
9443693	eng	Don't you like your name?
9443714	eng	All eyes were on me.
9443765	eng	Tom understood what we needed.
9443769	eng	That dog barks at strangers.
9443817	eng	Tom likes to watch cartoons.
9443944	eng	I'll speak to Tom immediately.
9443945	eng	We have the same hopes.
9443953	eng	We live in the country.
9443967	eng	I brought Tom with me.
9443970	eng	I brought this for you.
9444010	eng	You've added too much pepper.
9444020	eng	What you want from me?
9444112	eng	When does this course end?
9444119	eng	We need to lay low.
9444128	eng	Tom hardly ever reads books.
9444132	eng	When are we going there?
9444184	eng	Is that what they said?
9444200	eng	We're somewhat similar to Tom.
9444202	eng	Bats fly in the dark.
9444223	eng	One thing leads to another.

9444870	eng	Tom wasn't involved in this.
9444896	eng	Wait, we'll go with you.

9444927	eng	Rudeness is Donald Trump's trademark.
9444965	eng	This leads to passive aggressiveness.
9444978	eng	What Tom said was irrelevant.
9445014	eng	You shouldn't have told Tom.

9447553	eng	Does anybody need my help?
9447731	eng	She thought the same thing.

9447989	eng	Which place do you prefer?
9447996	eng	He arrived late at night.
9448001	eng	Why do women like gifts?
9448013	eng	Tom's clothes smell like smoke.
9448028	eng	Should I be completely honest?
9448031	eng	Look, here is my bike.
9448038	eng	Tom was a poor actor.
9448040	eng	Well, make up your mind.
9448044	eng	We went into a store.
9448051	eng	Good, then I will talk.
9448052	eng	Tom's cat scratched Mary's hand.
9448060	eng	My brother found the solution.
9448199	eng	We'll start doing that tomorrow.
9448214	eng	Tom left three years ago.
9448230	eng	We need to get started.
9448264	eng	My grandmother's hair is white.
9448284	eng	Can't you wait a bit?
9448302	eng	You need to release Tom.
9448308	eng	Tom's speech shocked the audience.

9448457	eng	Tom reluctantly apologized to Mary.
9448524	eng	Tom was convicted of extortion.
9448538	eng	We haven't talked about Algeria.

9448582	eng	Algeria isn't a small country.
9448601	eng	Does Algeria stand for democracy?
9448607	eng	Algeria remains my favorite country.
9448626	eng	Algeria is a gas exporter.
9448645	eng	Tom was no longer listening.
9448650	eng	That one isn't for sale.
9448757	eng	We'll take the next bus.
9448831	eng	The store was almost empty.
9448945	eng	He reached for the bag.
9448946	eng	She reached for the apple.
9448951	eng	No one heard the shot.
9448969	eng	Tom clearly wanted to leave.
9449026	eng	Tom spent the day drawing.
9449027	eng	We saw a moose today.
9449031	eng	Tom is testy and truculent.
9449037	eng	Tom is prickly and pugnacious.
9449045	eng	It's time to calm down.
9449061	eng	Is Algeria still a democracy?
9449062	eng	We better not go yet.
9449108	eng	You look like a pirate.
9449176	eng	Algeria's economic problems aren't insurmountable.
9449361	eng	The food needs more salt.
9449427	eng	What day were you born?
9449497	eng	Let's make one last effort.
9449580	eng	Easy for you to say!
9449674	eng	The wind is very strong.
9449870	eng	I haven't lost much weight.
9449936	eng	We haven't seen Tom recently.
9450178	eng	Why should anyone trust it?
9450319	eng	We don't pay very much.
9450492	eng	Tom's children can speak French.
9450601	eng	When did Tom discover this?
9450701	eng	Tom should do that immediately.
9450707	eng	It was a funny sight.

9451458	eng	I've seen Tom fairly recently.
9451527	eng	It'll be even colder tomorrow.
9451672	eng	Tom raised his son alone.
9451731	eng	Maybe it's for the best.
9451838	eng	Tourists like to come here.
9451936	eng	Tom seemed a little offended.
9451965	eng	Tom leaned on Mary's shoulder.
9452000	eng	You left the light on.
9452067	eng	Tom couldn't remember their names.
9452079	eng	I appreciate the library's quietness.
9452118	eng	I jotted down some notes.
9452167	eng	It's a book on health.
9452255	eng	His students loved his classes.
9452460	eng	Well, it's my own fault.
9452515	eng	I'm not expecting Tom's help.
9452665	eng	It is free to download.
9452674	eng	Tom was upset about something.
9452784	eng	Tom's eyes widened in fear.
9452893	eng	We've made a big mistake.
9452905	eng	How old is Donald Trump?
9452915	eng	How old is Joe Biden?
9452964	eng	Why can't dogs eat chocolate?
9452975	eng	We're on our way there.
9453193	eng	You need to stay calm.
9453266	eng	Tom divorced his first wife.
9453269	eng	Please do it in advance.
9453272	eng	Today is an auspicious day.
9453301	eng	This is what you'll do.
9453307	eng	I'm sorry Tom didn't come.
9453308	eng	Tom's left sleeve was torn.
9453316	eng	The pitcher struck Tom out.
9453317	eng	We don't have much water.
9453336	eng	We're very different from Tom.
9453337	eng	The rain turned to hail.
9453377	eng	Tom put down the newspaper.
9453383	eng	Sit down and watch TV.

9453472	eng	We don't go anywhere anymore.
9453482	eng	Tom called Mary a Karen.
9453486	eng	Tom hoped for the best.
9453492	eng	Tom doesn't believe in karma.
9453495	eng	Tom took three weeks' vacation.
9453508	eng	Tom talks like a robot.
9453545	eng	You choose your own path.
9453549	eng	Don't swear at the guests.
9453604	eng	Don't go near the border.
9453642	eng	Let's go to the castle.
9453651	eng	Tom's instructions were very confusing.

9453685	eng	What are Algeria's geographical challenges?
9453718	eng	Mom called us to dinner.

9453790	eng	Algeria should manufacture agricultural equipment.
9453801	eng	What's Algeria's general government debt?
9453847	eng	Just don't tell Tom anything.

9453891	eng	Algeria is a rentier state.
9453896	eng	Algeria is an oil giant.
9453909	eng	Algeria aims to increase tourism.
9453926	eng	Stay here until Tom returns.
9453999	eng	It'll cost some 10,000 yen.
9454019	eng	You could at least call.
9454137	eng	We'll announce our decision tomorrow.
9454244	eng	Tom managed to save himself.
9454252	eng	Let me kiss you again.
9454331	eng	Tom is under observation now.
9454362	eng	I should've eaten before Tom.
9454396	eng	Tom just made himself dinner.
9454438	eng	Only Tom, himself, knows that.
9454570	eng	Tom looks like an adult.
9454628	eng	Has Tom completed his degree?
9454685	eng	Tom spent the day working.
9454959	eng	Tom hopes this ends soon.
9455048	eng	Try to calm down first.
9455138	eng	Find out what's in there.

9455855	eng	Jean looked at a pear.
9455880	eng	I will fell a tree.
9455914	eng	Tom still hasn't reimbursed me.
9455972	eng	There's enough room for everyone.
9456059	eng	Tom will decide, not you.
9456101	eng	It must keep on raining.
9456114	eng	Tom is walking towards us.
9456118	eng	Let's get off the train.
9456151	eng	Who did harm to Tom?
9456178	eng	Tom sighed and turned away.
9456319	eng	Who did Tom invite here?
9456322	eng	Please don't leave Tom alone.

9456978	eng	Tawny owls nest in hollows.
9457010	eng	The entire floor is carpeted.

9458321	eng	Tom entered without greeting me.
9458326	eng	I'm glad Tom isn't there.
9458331	eng	You should've asked me first.
9458365	eng	Doctors do what they can.
9458436	eng	It was a risky choice.
9458443	eng	Don't stay on our account.

9471917	eng	I've seen that face before.
9471929	eng	Maybe you'd better tell Tom.
9471942	eng	I'll fly to Boston tomorrow.

9472882	eng	It is translated into Russian.
9472899	eng	We should talk about Algeria.
9472901	eng	How much does Algeria export?
9472907	eng	Algeria's opposition is so fragmented.
9472908	eng	In Algeria, politics is polarized.
9472951	eng	It's a very sad tale.
9473091	eng	Algeria's current growth isn't great.

9473737	eng	Who did Tom collaborate with?
9473801	eng	Could you help us, please?
9473809	eng	Tom can't overcome his depression.
9473862	eng	Tom didn't listen to me.
9474759	eng	This fashion came from England.
9475117	eng	I've never seen snow before.
9475142	eng	The result was very good.
9475295	eng	Where did you leave Tom?
9475363	eng	Tom stopped and looked around.
9475512	eng	You only think about yourself.
9475513	eng	You only think about yourself!
9475527	eng	That's so typical of you.
9475561	eng	I got home exhausted today.
9475617	eng	Tom didn't even want it.
9475653	eng	You'll be a grandma soon.
9475662	eng	Tom crept up behind Mary.
9475665	eng	Tom is an essential worker.
9475752	eng	That came out of left-field.
9475810	eng	Tom lives on the moon.
9475851	eng	Is that our only option?
9475852	eng	Is that our only choice?
9475882	eng	They both have shoes on.

9476095	eng	These things exist in Algeria.
9476109	eng	What is Algeria's growth rate?
9476113	eng	The war is finally over.
9476136	eng	"What's in that glass?" "Wine."
9476141	eng	Are there any bigger carrots?
9476142	eng	Are there any larger carrots?
9476153	eng	Yesterday was a normal day.
9476155	eng	Tom's very enthusiastic about it.
9476178	eng	Algeria could become great economically.
9476192	eng	Algeria's economy has slowed down.
9476206	eng	Tom didn't enjoy the movie.
9476228	eng	Algeria is benefiting from this.
9476233	eng	Tom suggests we wait here.
9476249	eng	He's going to be sacked.
9476290	eng	You've had your hair cut.
9476292	eng	They've had their hair cut.

9476385	eng	She couldn't find Mary's house.
9476393	eng	I was wondering that, too.
9476395	eng	Are you free tomorrow too?
9476397	eng	I'll graduate in three years.
9476435	eng	Then he wellied the ball.
9476486	eng	I'm free at the moment.
9476505	eng	I don't understand your psychology.
9476508	eng	You can accomplish amazing things.
9476544	eng	People lie on the Internet.
9476556	eng	I got home fairly late.
9476573	eng	I'll come if I can.
9476578	eng	Nobody I know trusts Tom.
9476699	eng	Maybe we need more food.
9476728	eng	I need to study tomorrow.
9476733	eng	Tom is an unreliable person.
9476763	eng	Have you ever felt cheated?
9476812	eng	Tom is a versatile person.
9476866	eng	Perhaps Tom is just worried.
9476889	eng	Tom saved the drowning man.
9476949	eng	I'll give you the money.
9477167	eng	Did you make an appointment?
9477186	eng	Why hasn't Tom arrived yet?
9477298	eng	We're not just like you.
9477343	eng	You're really stupid, aren't you?
9477574	eng	We're at war with Australia.

9477862	eng	Tom is shy with strangers.
9477888	eng	Tom's house has three rooms.
9477948	eng	I wanna know her name.
9477952	eng	Roadblocks have been put up.
9478055	eng	Don't take off your mask.

9479435	eng	I'll certainly need a car.
9479511	eng	How do you visualize Tom?
9479513	eng	OK, I'll give Tom everything.
9479574	eng	Let's go to school together.
9479579	eng	Tom made a shopping list.
9479608	eng	Throw the ball at Tom.

9506209	eng	This is not worth much.
9506213	eng	Take me away from here!
9506297	eng	You can't trust these people.
9506374	eng	You should get it changed.
9506386	eng	Is there a mosque nearby?
9506390	eng	Yanni quickly relocated to Algeria.
9506397	eng	Yanni enjoys reading Islamic books.
9506417	eng	Tom will be our guide.
9506420	eng	You left me almost nothing.
9506443	eng	It's probably just the weather.
9506479	eng	Algeria needs a strong government.
9506511	eng	Let me buy you this.
9506559	eng	Algeria is one and indivisible.
9506603	eng	Tebboune wants to reshape Algeria.
9506826	eng	Tom was shaking with anger.
9507148	eng	I hope you rethink it.
9507169	eng	I'll wait for Tom here.
9507286	eng	Today I drove to work.
9507337	eng	Where did you learn Spanish?
9507375	eng	You said you didn't drink.
9507664	eng	Be patient with Tom, please.
9507685	eng	Who do you ask about?
9507690	eng	Can you see it too?
9507691	eng	I am not killing them.
9507700	eng	Have you heard about Tatoeba?
9507742	eng	I looked into the water.
9508319	eng	You shouldn't be in there.
9508529	eng	Should I get a tattoo?
9508599	eng	Tom was accused of scaremongering.
9508703	eng	I'm allowed to do this.
9508988	eng	Tom has a terrible attitude.
9509042	eng	Tom's arguing in bad faith.
9509067	eng	I'd never seen snow before.
9509099	eng	I don't have the answers.
9509139	eng	You were very young then.
9509774	eng	You're not a saint, either.
9509795	eng	You've got to turn round.
9509796	eng	You have to turn round.
9509802	eng	Will it still be open?
9509811	eng	It shuts at half five.
9509918	eng	I eat less than you.
9509923	eng	You eat more than me.
9510060	eng	Maybe he's already left Kyoto.
9510078	eng	Have you parked far away?
9510079	eng	Did you park far away?
9510100	eng	It doesn't look like enough.
9510102	eng	That doesn't look like enough.
9510107	eng	Today is her sister's wedding.
9510169	eng	Have you got Josie's address?
9510204	eng	I have less than you.
9510208	eng	I've got less than you.
9510213	eng	I have fewer than you.
9510216	eng	I've got fewer than you.
9510249	eng	Your mobile was switched off.
9510254	eng	Your phone was switched off.
9510318	eng	He's sitting in the armchair.
9510323	eng	We go to the park.
9510324	eng	We're going to the park.
9510330	eng	She is listening to music.
9510364	eng	My friend is a teacher.
9510366	eng	My girlfriend is a teacher.
9510368	eng	My boyfriend is a teacher.
9510371	eng	I'm switching the light off.
9510372	eng	I'm switching off the light.
9510411	eng	We're looking for her car.
9510413	eng	We're looking for his car.
9510416	eng	She's looking for her car.
9510418	eng	He's looking for his car.
9510538	eng	Tom's lost touch with reality.
9510556	eng	I can hardly see anything.
9510608	eng	Tom's an old sea dog.
9510611	eng	You can't live without sleep.
9510612	eng	This apple is for Tom.
9510613	eng	Because of this, I left.
9510614	eng	You said you weren't scared.
9510615	eng	You said you weren't afraid.
9510616	eng	You said you were scared.
9510617	eng	You said you were afraid.
9510619	eng	I have a pet tarantula.
9510642	eng	You'll definitely be happy there.
9510651	eng	We planted too many carrots.
9510677	eng	You look good with glasses.
9510678	eng	Tom is suspected of stealing.
9510679	eng	Tom has a dirty conscience.
9510689	eng	You can't argue with that.
9510708	eng	You'll sound like a nerd.
9510710	eng	Tom will arrive Monday morning.
9510721	eng	I'll try it again later.
9510734	eng	Wait here with everybody else.
9510767	eng	I couldn't help but notice.
9510790	eng	You must've changed a lot.
9510828	eng	You did that pretty well.
9510862	eng	You should already be asleep.
9510896	eng	You should clean your room.
9510938	eng	You have to decide quickly.
9510948	eng	Tom left without noticing me.
9510984	eng	You aren't offended, are you?
9511010	eng	Tom didn't kiss me goodbye.
9511031	eng	You'll find the link below.
9511129	eng	I feel reluctant and upset.
9511142	eng	Tom studied art in Boston.
9511153	eng	I'd better not to say.
9511164	eng	I know this is wrong.
9511220	eng	You have failed once again.
9511237	eng	It's been nearly 3 hours.
9511282	eng	I will phone you later.
9511330	eng	Everything is going like clockwork.
9511339	eng	Yanni is a born Muslim.
9511340	eng	Yanni is talking about Islam.
9511353	eng	Reach out to other Muslims.
9511357	eng	Algeria is Yanni's new home.
9511359	eng	This mosque is so beautiful.
9511362	eng	Yanni went to the mosque.
9511389	eng	"Are you Muslim?" "Of course."
9511391	eng	"Are you two Muslim?" "Sure."
9511392	eng	You aren't my wife anymore.
9511394	eng	"Are you Muslim?" "Yes, sir."
9511434	eng	These roses smell of butt.
9511445	eng	You must take this seriously.
9511455	eng	Why's Tom wearing that hat?
9511459	eng	Why's Tom wearing a cape?
9511531	eng	Stop trying to provoke Tom.
9511533	eng	Which path should we take?
9511553	eng	Let Tom do his thing.
9511638	eng	That's your house, isn't it?
9511640	eng	That's your horse, isn't it?
9511663	eng	Don't spoil it for me!
9511683	eng	"I'm sorry." "Sorry? For what?"
9511711	eng	Why is your method better?
9511864	eng	She always puts on diapers.
9512009	eng	Don't waste so much effort!
9512020	eng	Tom hasn't contacted me yet.
9512186	eng	You definitely won't like it.
9512190	eng	Tom is a skilled investigator.
9512296	eng	This happens way too often.
9512297	eng	Tom Jackson's popularity is falling.
9512370	eng	How deep is this hole?
9512376	eng	Don't tell anyone my secret.
9512473	eng	It was completely dark inside.
9512484	eng	Don't you need some money?
9512502	eng	We've run out of painkillers.
9512607	eng	This church is very big.
9512618	eng	You can eat that flower.
9512620	eng	That flower can be eaten.
9512661	eng	You aren't doing your job.
9512801	eng	You're now taller than me.
9513026	eng	Your words touched my heart!
9513112	eng	Tom didn't appreciate Mary's jokes.
9513238	eng	You won't need it anymore.
9513312	eng	Will you visit us soon?
9513378	eng	You slept almost all day.
9513385	eng	It's good Tom isn't here.
9513411	eng	So, what have you done?
9513505	eng	Tom never really loved Mary.
9513732	eng	Let me feed the dogs.
9513790	eng	You have to trust yourself.
9513812	eng	You said you didn't smoke.
9513840	eng	Can you catch a fish?
9513863	eng	She constantly needs to laugh.
9513867	eng	My uncle lives in Keitum.
9513917	eng	The book costs four coins.
9513923	eng	Please give me an apple.
9513928	eng	Please switch on the light.
9513930	eng	We are building a house.
9513953	eng	The rabbit eats the cabbage.
9514052	eng	Tom is an accomplished diver.
9514389	eng	You could've asked me first.
9514535	eng	You managed to surprise me.
9514677	eng	Tom has a phenomenal memory.
9514969	eng	You left us almost nothing.
9515115	eng	You were my best student.
9515960	eng	You can't divide by zero.
9516465	eng	You should be here tomorrow.
9516595	eng	You should've already done that.
9516684	eng	Is that what he said?
9516805	eng	You're going to get cold.
9516827	eng	We were holding our breath.
9516878	eng	It suddenly went very quiet.
9516908	eng	The locksmith repaired the door.
9516947	eng	We saw it, as well.
9516949	eng	We've seen it, as well.
9516962	eng	There's no shortage of opportunities.
9516964	eng	There's no lack of opportunities.
9516971	eng	He didn't know anyone there.
9517002	eng	This wood must be protected.
9517007	eng	That's not what we said.
9517010	eng	We rarely met each other.
9517011	eng	We seldom met each other.
9517023	eng	He held his feelings back.
9517024	eng	He held back his feelings.
9517031	eng	A gentle rain was falling.
9517039	eng	They're not at all alike.
9517043	eng	They're not at all similar.
9517063	eng	There will be other times.
9517126	eng	You never called me back.
9517141	eng	They're looking for a book.
9517142	eng	She's looking for a book.
9517177	eng	There's money on the table.
9517180	eng	Do you have a television?
9517282	eng	Tom pressed the button again.
9517302	eng	The ceiling is very low.
9517306	eng	You'll never beat me again.
9517351	eng	Tell me about the party.
9517457	eng	Tom handled the situation well.
9517567	eng	Is there a phone nearby?
9517573	eng	And who is the bride?
9517578	eng	This coat might fit you.
9517597	eng	You only made one mistake.
9517722	eng	I really want some biscuits.
9517768	eng	Fancy a bite to eat?
9517779	eng	Fancy a cup of tea?
9517785	eng	Is catnip safe for kittens?
9517880	eng	This furniture store is aptly-named.
9517891	eng	Will the lockdown ever end?
9517915	eng	I'll be leaving tomorrow night.
9517996	eng	I'll brew up some tea.
9517998	eng	Fingers crossed it'll be ok.
9518007	eng	Didn't you read the contract?
9518018	eng	You can just keep it.
9518021	eng	It's denatured alcohol, I think.
9518043	eng	I spent all day reading.
9518049	eng	It's slow going this week.
9518050	eng	You don't make the rules.
9518065	eng	Food arrives in an hour.
9518111	eng	You aren't that old either.
9518118	eng	Who does Tom live with?
9518124	eng	Does this look like malice?
9518129	eng	Does this look like confidence?
9518202	eng	Let me make some coffee.
9518210	eng	What're the Whigs called nowadays?
9518227	eng	Oh Tom's into horse riding?
9518262	eng	We both know you're lying.
9518267	eng	Salmon swim upstream to spawn.
9518313	eng	It was a total fluke.
9518373	eng	They declared a truce, finally.
9518432	eng	Trying saying "No" some time.
9518446	eng	You can't win this battle.
9518465	eng	You shouldn't be doing this.
9518483	eng	I've never liked living here.
9518489	eng	You took too many chances.
9518494	eng	I left work early today.
9518498	eng	That proves that I'm right.
9518503	eng	I've already heard this once.
9518537	eng	Tom's birthday is next month.
9518547	eng	No one was having fun.
9518550	eng	It isn't hot today either.
9518558	eng	I don't need much time.
9518565	eng	Why didn't you call anybody?
9518566	eng	Tom is an altruistic person.
9518579	eng	What color is Tom's shirt?
9518580	eng	There's a bird over there.
9518592	eng	That isn't what I ordered.
9518593	eng	Tom drives a red truck.
9518595	eng	You're so easy to deceive.
9518596	eng	Tom likes to photograph food.
9518599	eng	You have beautiful brown eyes.
9518629	eng	You can talk freely here.
9518652	eng	You and I weren't invited.
9518653	eng	Tom bought the cheaper one.
9518664	eng	I slept almost all afternoon.
9518743	eng	I won't read it anyway.
9518746	eng	Tom is obsessed with Australia.
9518804	eng	Tom is into moe characters.
9518839	eng	Tom can't handle the tension.
9518845	eng	You can't deny the truth.
9518850	eng	I enjoy fishing with Tom.
9518955	eng	You're not that old either.
9518966	eng	It's always time for coffee.
9518979	eng	You must've been blown away.
9519086	eng	What motives could Tom have?
9519111	eng	The pallid moon is waning.
9519133	eng	You weren't even born then.
9519419	eng	He's never been this late.
9519494	eng	Tom's dog fetched the ball.
9519685	eng	You're not offended, are you?
9519772	eng	I don't just watch TV.
9519793	eng	You already know my story.
9519857	eng	Science has always interested me.
9519868	eng	Tom isn't guilty of anything.
9520040	eng	You told me that yourself.
9520496	eng	Tom did everything he wanted.
9520866	eng	You shouldn't have said no.
9520873	eng	Tom really doesn't like that.
9521046	eng	You guys look very confident.
9521127	eng	Why did I come here?
9521201	eng	Tom works as a bodyguard.
9521517	eng	Life is full of riddles.
9521582	eng	Her illness explains her absence.
9521661	eng	You promised to call back.
9521824	eng	You made a funny mistake.
9521840	eng	We're all out of tinfoil.
9521991	eng	Tom was baptized last week.
9522099	eng	You shouldn't have seen this.
9522184	eng	It was a deadly hailstorm.
9522191	eng	The twister destroyed Tom's house.
9522257	eng	I can't remember a thing.
9522362	eng	I'll feel lonely without Tom.
9522648	eng	I would like another car.
9522732	eng	Tom now has a beard.
9522901	eng	The wolf has bitten Maria.
9522914	eng	Both agreed to my suggestion.
9522973	eng	Remove the handcuffs from Tom.
9522990	eng	I like to eat beans.
9523027	eng	I like the colourful dress.
9523175	eng	The jacket is too wide.
9523195	eng	The sausage is too fat.
9523229	eng	That is a beautiful drawing.
9523246	eng	I read the newspaper sometimes.
9523251	eng	I read the paper sometimes.
9523278	eng	Tom wishes to remain anonymous.
9523857	eng	Fortunately, Tom didn't get injured.
9524063	eng	Would you like more soup?
9524065	eng	Would anybody like more soup?
9524133	eng	Tom carefully folded his clothes.
9524175	eng	The teacher was always serious.
9524183	eng	That wasn't important to Tom.
9524187	eng	I have understood nearly everything.
9524221	eng	They have caught the thief.
9524245	eng	Have a nice after-work evening!
9524289	eng	We have guests this evening.
9524333	eng	Let me open the door.
9524377	eng	You'll outlive all of us.
9524419	eng	You aren't tall like me.
9524478	eng	How did you get wounded?
9524538	eng	You weren't like this before.
9524544	eng	Tom bought us matching swimsuits.
9524549	eng	School's been shut for months.
9524555	eng	We can play volleyball here.
9524612	eng	Tom isn't my husband yet.
9524613	eng	Are you positive about that?
9524623	eng	You look like a farmer.
9524640	eng	I'd rather stay inside today.
9524643	eng	Tom says yes to everything.
9524645	eng	Families don't have to match.
9524654	eng	Can Tom actually do that?
9524661	eng	Can Tom actually do it?
9524666	eng	Why's everyone talking about Tom?
9524667	eng	Why's everybody talking about Tom?
9524671	eng	You're not that important, Tom.
9524679	eng	Tom doesn't have a TV.
9524681	eng	Tom doesn't have a television.
9524685	eng	Tom won't believe me anyway.
9524750	eng	You talk like my mother.
9524757	eng	You're interfering with our work.
9524775	eng	Tom wished to remain anonymous.
9524785	eng	You never asked for help.
9524808	eng	You've helped me so much.
9524815	eng	You can register for free.
9524851	eng	He can go with me.
9524855	eng	She reads books every night.
9524858	eng	Whoever gets there first, wins.
9524863	eng	The quilt can't be washed.
9524868	eng	All the kids are awake.
9524871	eng	He's in the emergency room.
9524882	eng	We can't win this battle.
9524884	eng	He'll do what he wants.
9524897	eng	Do you have the symptoms?
9524913	eng	"Was Tom drunk?" "Probably not."
9524923	eng	It couldn't go very fast.
9524924	eng	The cake is so sweet.
9524931	eng	You should follow this rule.
9524935	eng	That was a smart move.
9524938	eng	That bread is freshly made.
9524940	eng	This key isn't from here.
9524947	eng	Families with kids were trapped.
9524952	eng	I did it without realizing.
9524953	eng	The A/C is killing me.
9524954	eng	Tell us to our face.
9524969	eng	They didn't think you'd survive.
9524970	eng	He doesn't feel like it.
9524971	eng	There's a nightstand over there.
9524974	eng	They've reopened the ski slopes.
9524981	eng	At least half must vote.
9525003	eng	This makes me feel good.
9525006	eng	Castille is full of castles.
9525015	eng	It's been snowing all afternoon.
9525024	eng	Say it to my face.
9525028	eng	I had to study yesterday.
9525039	eng	I want to suffer less.
9525042	eng	You're getting on my nerves.
9525055	eng	He's going to the park.
9525061	eng	Where are my red stockings?
9525102	eng	I'm too weak to fight.
9525108	eng	The way is very wide.
9525112	eng	The pillow is too soft.
9525118	eng	It is very windy today.
9525127	eng	Tom has a kidney stone.
9525162	eng	When will Tom show up?
9525179	eng	Do you have a Band-Aid?
9525183	eng	Fresh mushrooms are so tasty.
9525184	eng	You must've gotten it wrong.
9525201	eng	He looks better than you.
9525233	eng	I'll go to the doctor.
9525245	eng	Tom's plan has gone awry.
9525302	eng	That wouldn't make any sense.
9525303	eng	Didn't Tom say Mary left?
9525310	eng	We might be in danger.
9525403	eng	The concert's about to start.
9525427	eng	What vegetables does Tom like?
9525457	eng	I really wanted that job.
9525482	eng	Tom looked at Mary skeptically.
9525557	eng	Did anyone see Tom yesterday?
9525574	eng	Tom studies French every evening.
9525577	eng	Tom has a chicken farm.
9525618	eng	I better stop thinking then.
9525621	eng	I should just stop thinking.
9525636	eng	My French isn't so good.

9594573	eng	Yanni likes living in Algeria.
9594581	eng	What is this button for?
9594582	eng	Yanni still lives in Algeria.
9594609	eng	Yanni teaches Berber at home.
9594616	eng	Yanni misses his Berber classes.
9594629	eng	They gathered for Berber class.

9597907	eng	He has a youthful voice.
9597911	eng	She has a youthful voice.
9597943	eng	What a very smart child!
9601138	eng	He's a buzzkill, a killjoy.
9601249	eng	Tom should do it again.
9601293	eng	Tom has also done this.
9601436	eng	I'm not fluent in Cat.
9601661	eng	Of course, we'll blame them.
9601665	eng	My clothes are all gone.
9601698	eng	Tom did this, not Mary.
9601701	eng	Did Tom shut the door?
9601703	eng	Did Tom close the door?
9601759	eng	We need to keep trying.
9601828	eng	Things didn't happen as expected.
9601839	eng	Tom doesn't do it here.
9601869	eng	You lost. Get over it.
9601889	eng	Thank you for rescuing us.
9601970	eng	Tom said he'll do this.
9601978	eng	I don't own a gun.
9601979	eng	Maybe Tom will be there.
9602134	eng	Yanni denied ever teaching Berber.
9602173	eng	He told what he saw.
9602262	eng	Yanni wanted to teach Berber.
9602268	eng	We should sit with Tom.
9602270	eng	Yanni's life was in danger.
9602280	eng	Does Tom do this often?
9602286	eng	Yanni wants a better life.
9602294	eng	Tom helped me pick apples.
9602297	eng	Please help me learn Berber.
9602434	eng	That's what we should do.
9602447	eng	Let's not sit with Tom.
9602708	eng	You are five years old.
9602933	eng	Tom folded his clothes carefully.
9603811	eng	We could still help Tom.
9603928	eng	That'll never, ever happen again.
9603936	eng	Go heat up some water.
9604245	eng	The beach wasn't very crowded.
9604689	eng	Tom may do it tomorrow.
9604792	eng	Doing this correctly is critical.
9605645	eng	I thought I could help.
9606325	eng	I've seen Tom doing it.
9606336	eng	Always have a backup plan.
9606892	eng	Tom needs to leave Boston.
9606927	eng	Tom really did do this.
9607121	eng	Maybe Tom will do this.
9607159	eng	We can let that wait.
9607165	eng	Tom does this too much.
9607235	eng	This is at my expense.
9607244	eng	What a waste of money.
9607408	eng	Why do you hate yourself?
9607452	eng	We need a third option.
9607485	eng	Do you need a gun?
9608158	eng	Let Tom figure it out.
9609106	eng	How can I help him?
9609114	eng	The river will dry up.
9609259	eng	Did they write to them?
9609301	eng	Why are we studying it?
9609556	eng	How can we trust Tom?
9609713	eng	I'll try and help you.
9609793	eng	This nice weather won't last.
9610349	eng	Doesn't Tom ever do it?
9610394	eng	Ask Tom how that works.
9610437	eng	I'm happy Tom did this.
9610797	eng	Tom can't do this well.
9610823	eng	I showed Tom my tattoo.
9611034	eng	That's why I fired Tom.
9611186	eng	They've already finished the work.
9611223	eng	Tom only did this once.
9611268	eng	Tom left after one week.
9611366	eng	Tom pitched a good game.
9611368	eng	Doing that was unbelievably hard.
9611382	eng	Thank you for the compliment.
9611385	eng	Perhaps Tom will do it.
9611391	eng	We'll keep on doing this.
9611393	eng	I don't like wearing flip-flops.
9611443	eng	I want something like that.
9611450	eng	I have three missed calls.
9611459	eng	Is there any money left?
9611460	eng	Is there any food left?
9611462	eng	None of this is mine.
9611470	eng	Let's rent some roller skates.
9611555	eng	He often asked for alms.
9611677	eng	I bit into his tail.
9611701	eng	Tom often sits with Mary.
9611706	eng	We couldn't find the tunnel.
9611711	eng	Is sugar good for you?
9611719	eng	Of course, it's different now.
9611723	eng	Isn't it important to listen?
9611745	eng	Could you sit with Tom?
9611956	eng	Yanni became a Berber teacher.
9611989	eng	Yanni totally hated his mother-in-law.
9611990	eng	Yanni bravely called the police.
9612006	eng	How should Tom do this?
9612017	eng	Leave the poor guy alone.
9612018	eng	I'd never sit with Tom.
9612021	eng	Tom's money didn't last long.
9612022	eng	We need to change that.
9612193	eng	I'm a beginner at Esperanto.
9612206	eng	I thought Tom did this.
9612239	eng	Tom did this very well.
9613689	eng	You all need to leave.
9613759	eng	Tom intends to do this.
9614009	eng	Tokyo is a hard-working city.
9614283	eng	You must sit with Tom.
9614370	eng	Tom hopes Mary does it.
9614929	eng	The cold reddened her legs.
9615010	eng	That timing was nearly perfect.
9615234	eng	It didn't happen right away.
9615359	eng	What Tom did was wicked.
9615400	eng	Tom almost bled to death.
9615571	eng	Tom might do it soon.
9615576	eng	Is Tom really doing it?
9615729	eng	Tom taught me butterfly swimming.
9615982	eng	Tom no longer needs help.
9616651	eng	Her face looks completely restructured.
9617154	eng	Tom doesn't do it well.
9617207	eng	People seem to like Tom.
9617261	eng	Tom didn't do it right.
9617682	eng	Be polite and respect others.
9617962	eng	Your fur feels really nice.
9618065	eng	Tom denies he did this.
9618662	eng	We should've set off earlier.
9618790	eng	It was quite breezy outside.
9618879	eng	How do I get better?
9619044	eng	Tom has done this once.
9620678	eng	Where are all your promises?
9621055	eng	Where did my homework go?
9621058	eng	Everyone should take a turn.
9621061	eng	Tom doesn't do it much.
9621169	eng	We need to calm down.
9621276	eng	This quilt can't be washed.
9621282	eng	Tom bought me a present.
9621356	eng	I drink tea every day.
9621366	eng	That's unlikely to happen today.
9621447	eng	Tom did this on Monday.
9621611	eng	Police don't suspect foul play.
9621629	eng	Let me help Tom first.
9621646	eng	Tom can't do it either.
9621707	eng	You know who he is?
9621930	eng	The second semester is over.
9621941	eng	I'll get into big trouble.
9621951	eng	We'll leave when Tom does.
9621973	eng	Tom said he heard everything.
9621980	eng	It caught him off guard.
9622092	eng	Don't translate word for word.
9622281	eng	Ask Tom how he's doing.
9622286	eng	People don't speak like that.
9622290	eng	Everybody should take a turn.
9622292	eng	Why would Tom need help?
9622334	eng	I barely have any money.
9622340	eng	Tom studied philosophy at college.
9622381	eng	Please don't pull my ears.
9622448	eng	Everybody has their own opinion.
9623018	eng	You can't sit with Tom.
9623037	eng	The horses all ran away.
9623050	eng	The outcome wasn't even close.
9623338	eng	I didn't know that existed.
9623442	eng	Tom arrived before I did.
9623443	eng	Watermelon is a summer fruit.
9623445	eng	She's always on my mind.
9623452	eng	I want more from you.
9623454	eng	Nobody saw Tom do this.
9623859	eng	Don't let your friends down.
9623942	eng	My younger brother hates working.
9623945	eng	The strike lasted three weeks.
9624049	eng	Your French pronunciation is horrible.
9624097	eng	Where is my thermos flask?
9624217	eng	Let's have Tom do this.
9624240	eng	Tom must like doing it.
9624346	eng	I have a rock band.
9624854	eng	Notice how Tom does it.
9624922	eng	I was no longer needed.
9625657	eng	Nobody but Tom does it.
9625775	eng	I feel like a heel.
9626434	eng	Ask Tom what he needs.
9626461	eng	Tom admitted he did it.
9626971	eng	Tom got a raw deal.
9627041	eng	I wish them every happiness.
9627057	eng	Tom almost sat with Mary.
9627382	eng	Tom's excuse is pretty thin.
9627619	eng	You don't need a visa.
9627628	eng	Tom didn't do it again.
9627720	eng	That was very well done.
9627929	eng	Why do dogs eat grass?
9627931	eng	Tom says he's doing it.
9627945	eng	What Tom did was predictable.
9628236	eng	Tom went for the jugular.
9628262	eng	We need to be precise.
9628279	eng	Now look what you done.
9628283	eng	When will dinner be served?
9628286	eng	How long did he walk?
9628298	eng	Tom didn't let us down.
9628300	eng	Do those shoes fit you?
9628302	eng	I don't read comic books.
9628305	eng	Explain the rules to me.
9628306	eng	Several roads have been closed.
9628309	eng	Tom ate my BLT sandwich.
9628319	eng	Tom still hasn't returned home.
9628323	eng	Is Tom still not here?
9628330	eng	Please don't tell him anything.
9628352	eng	Is sugar bad for you?
9628354	eng	This app is very useful.
9628355	eng	None of this is yours.
9628356	eng	I, too, often get angry.
9628362	eng	That's the reason I left.
9628376	eng	Your front gate is open.
9628377	eng	Tom can do it tomorrow.
9628379	eng	Could you move these boxes?
9628385	eng	Most adults have 32 teeth.
9628386	eng	Children have 20 baby teeth.
9628398	eng	If you're ready, let's go.
9628411	eng	In ghettos, police are powerless.
9628420	eng	I think this is French.
9628431	eng	Can we take pictures here?
9628432	eng	May we take pictures here?
9628439	eng	That gave me a headache.
9628440	eng	Sometimes one word is enough.
9628457	eng	Tom can probably do it.
9628482	eng	Tom didn't do it today.
9628485	eng	I like to buy jewelry.
9628539	eng	All my friends have girlfriends.
9628553	eng	We're on the wrong path.
9628599	eng	Did you wash clothes today?
9628602	eng	Tom needs to be heard.
9628699	eng	Tom doesn't feel guilty anymore.
9628703	eng	How did you find that?
9628859	eng	Tom had fun doing this.
9629166	eng	Yanni didn't see Skura's knife.
9629167	eng	I suspect Tom did this.
9629175	eng	Yanni can't speak the truth.
9629240	eng	She does that every day.
9629252	eng	The orchestra played wonderful symphonies.
9629343	eng	This is sad but true.
9629544	eng	I'm single but you aren't.
9629779	eng	I've been trying to help.
9629790	eng	You need to lay low.
9629834	eng	Tom did this very fast.
9630190	eng	Do you like small talk?
9630483	eng	Don't make Tom do this.
9630490	eng	You've got to keep working.
9630511	eng	Did she get the package?
9630527	eng	I don't like domestic chores.
9630531	eng	He's not malevolent, just stupid.
9630575	eng	We didn't sit with Tom.
9630633	eng	I'd like to learn German.
9630653	eng	I know your brother well.
9630657	eng	We know how to drive.
9630662	eng	I don't like boiled egg.
9630671	eng	Who gave you that task?
9630716	eng	They treated him like garbage.
9630721	eng	Tom hopes you'll do it.
9630756	eng	It may not happen soon.
9630760	eng	Sorry, but that is impossible.
9630773	eng	I feared this would happen.
9630776	eng	Why's Tom always so hungry?
9630791	eng	He didn't send any message.
9630809	eng	I wrote the same things.
9631083	eng	Tom was promoted last week.
9631116	eng	Tom should do this now.
9631176	eng	Let me take that back.
9631349	eng	He doesn't have many friends.
9631522	eng	Tom just kept on singing.
9631720	eng	They tried to stay calm.
9631722	eng	You tried to stay calm.
9631882	eng	Please show up on time.
9631920	eng	The food didn't get wasted.
9631980	eng	He is arguing about details.
9631984	eng	I sent him a letter.
9632034	eng	I sold my old guitar.
9632053	eng	Tom is pessimistic about everything.
9632085	eng	I don't like big houses.
9632091	eng	My house is not big.
9632103	eng	Tom wants to leave early.
9632111	eng	My car is not brown.
9632123	eng	My car is not yellow.
9632155	eng	Tom says Mary did this.
9632408	eng	Didn't Tom sit with Mary?
9632444	eng	Maybe Tom didn't hear me.
9632749	eng	I want to learn Kabyle.
9632807	eng	Tom can't do this here.
9632860	eng	They held it for us.
9633076	eng	Tom plays soccer at school.
9633157	eng	No one's actually like that.
9633422	eng	That's just part of it.
9633434	eng	I'm sorry we can't help.
9633443	eng	Tom has tried doing it.
9633773	eng	That's a few too many.
9633809	eng	How did it turn out?
9633813	eng	How did it work out?
9633873	eng	He felt a bit tired.
9634206	eng	Tom does not believe it.
9634229	eng	There's a place for everything.
9634233	eng	Is there a ghost here?
9634248	eng	People do not believe it.
9634267	eng	Tomas owes Maria 300 dollars.
9634272	eng	I am allergic to milk.
9634288	eng	It's all my own fault.
9634293	eng	Children have twenty baby teeth.
9634295	eng	Tom might sit with Mary.
9634324	eng	I hear a dog bark.
9634387	eng	She is an FBI agent.
9634388	eng	This bed is very hard.
9634393	eng	Tom suggested that we stay.
9634396	eng	Don't cry in the street.
9634403	eng	Help me lift that box.
9634410	eng	Tom wore an ill-fitting shirt.
9634468	eng	Doing that was a breeze.
9634472	eng	Doing that was extremely easy.
9634473	eng	Doing that was quite easy.
9634487	eng	There are two possibilities here.
9634506	eng	He took a step right.
9634518	eng	That is a good T-shirt.
9634525	eng	Should I change the sentence?
9634566	eng	The driver caused the accident.
9634573	eng	I'm afraid to drink it.
9634591	eng	We know how to read.
9634592	eng	We know how to write.
9634593	eng	We know how to count.
9634594	eng	They know how to count.
9634595	eng	She knows how to count.
9634613	eng	This bird flies very quickly.
9634625	eng	My best friend is Danish.
9634642	eng	Tom was a religious man.
9634651	eng	Did you forget your mask?
9634654	eng	That keyboard is very pretty.
9634657	eng	His feet are very dirty.
9634674	eng	What will you cook today?
9634685	eng	Tom does it quite well.
9634688	eng	Someday we'll all meet again.
9634693	eng	Make Tom stop doing it.
9634697	eng	Mary is sophisticated, isn't she?
9634817	eng	Tom needed some extra help.
9634874	eng	Tom says he'll do this.
9634891	eng	This isn't a done deal.
9634932	eng	Last night was a success.
9635268	eng	What's your favorite concert hall?
9635501	eng	Yanni was under enormous stress.
9635511	eng	Can't you sit with Tom?
9635528	eng	We're not going to Algiers.
9635593	eng	Kabylia is a welcoming country.
9635597	eng	Algeria colonized Kabylia in 1962.
9635641	eng	Yanni saw vultures flying overhead.
9635679	eng	The last suggestion was Tom's.
9635686	eng	You seem to be content.
9635690	eng	My country is always right.
9635792	eng	The epilogue was probably unnecessary.
9635819	eng	Tom decided to do this.
9635857	eng	Did they step on yours?
9635858	eng	This is where Tom leaves.
9635869	eng	Tom claims he did this.
9635934	eng	You should've made Tom leave.
9635971	eng	The epilogue probably wasn't necessary.
9636018	eng	Things seem to have improved.
9636033	eng	We sat on the fence.
9636100	eng	I'd rather Tom do this.
9636106	eng	We don't need you here.
9636125	eng	Tom ran home for help.
9636129	eng	Last night was a disaster.
9636287	eng	Tom really enjoys writing poems.
9636314	eng	Why do you hate Japanese?
9636321	eng	Everything will be fine today.
9636322	eng	Everything will go well today.
9636328	eng	What did you buy me?
9636329	eng	What did you get me?
9636338	eng	I want to learn German.
9636392	eng	Tom did this last year.
9636422	eng	What Tom did wasn't unexpected.
9636831	eng	He reads with his fingers.
9637058	eng	Tom needs help right away.
9637093	eng	The cat ate my meal.
9637177	eng	Can you tell what's happening?
9637178	eng	Can you see what's happening?
9637226	eng	Tom was wearing shabby clothes.
9637253	eng	You'd better plan for problems.
9637257	eng	Of course, it didn't happen.
9637281	eng	Who was talking with Tom?
9637294	eng	I don't need that yet.
9637295	eng	Do you need this now?
9637299	eng	Tom drinks almost every day.
9637306	eng	Please turn the light on.
9637307	eng	Turn the light on, please.
9637320	eng	That's what Tom keeps saying.
9637322	eng	Tom thinks Mary did it.
9637361	eng	The pay wasn't very good.
9637364	eng	Tom said Mary did this.
9637392	eng	Tom appears to be broken.
9637410	eng	Have you met Tom's wife?
9637418	eng	We rowed across the lake.
9637421	eng	We sailed along the coast.
9637444	eng	I don't read the newspapers.
9637467	eng	Something's wrong with my car.
9637482	eng	We live close the school.
9637846	eng	Yanni had friends in Algiers.
9637847	eng	Skura was sweet and tender.
9637848	eng	Skura was loving and tender.
9637849	eng	Yanni was an abusive husband.
9637893	eng	Yanni was running the show.
9637896	eng	Yanni was a headstrong go-getter.
9637965	eng	Even Tom offered to help.
9637968	eng	Tom hasn't yet done it.
9638049	eng	I've been disappointed many times.
9638066	eng	I've been coughing all day.
9638093	eng	My job has gotten harder.
9638142	eng	Does Tom still do this?
9638151	eng	"How do I look?" "Great."
9638153	eng	"How do I look?" "Perfect."
9638164	eng	Yanni's upbringing was extremely violent.
9638171	eng	Yanni entered Algiers' criminal underbelly.
9638196	eng	She made it crystal clear.
9638211	eng	You are walking to Kherata.
9638221	eng	Figure it out by yourselves.
9638272	eng	Tom did it really well.
9638284	eng	They will keep those sweets.
9638287	eng	Maybe I'll need some help.
9638293	eng	I am running towards Iberbachen.
9638297	eng	You will go to Brazil.
9638299	eng	You will see that director.
9638301	eng	Do not lie to them.
9638306	eng	They took a hard hit.
9638311	eng	Tom has done this, too.
9638320	eng	She left as she came.
9638326	eng	Skura was probably pretty charming.
9638467	eng	Nobody got arrested last night.
9638549	eng	Tom said he could help.
9638561	eng	He's not afraid of death.
9638577	eng	She turned to me, smiling.
9638585	eng	I'm going to the hotel.
9638593	eng	The princess was indescribably beautiful.
9638600	eng	Wine is not for children.
9638604	eng	Children should not drink wine.
9638606	eng	Children shouldn't be drinking wine.
9638611	eng	I'm on holidays this week.
9638729	eng	Tom didn't do it alone.
9638738	eng	I'd like to pay cash.
9638752	eng	How many people were sitting?
9638894	eng	Let's help Tom do this.
9638904	eng	We had a long conversation.
9638914	eng	I stopped believing in love.
9638987	eng	There's nothing wrong with fantasizing.
9639007	eng	My fathers live in Australia.
9639044	eng	Should we sit with Tom?
9639072	eng	You speak good English already.
9639360	eng	Tom never sits with Mary.
9639530	eng	Tom might buy a tuba.
9639536	eng	I felt like a sucker.
9639620	eng	Will you sit with Tom?
9640072	eng	Ask for some written estimates.
9640091	eng	I showed Tom my masterpiece.
9640120	eng	Tom will do it himself.
9640334	eng	Tom just might do this.
9640362	eng	It's still a big deal.
9640372	eng	Tom did it without help.
9640523	eng	Tom did it very efficiently.
9640586	eng	There was a big snowstorm.
9640592	eng	Tom and Mary played hockey.
9640605	eng	Even Tom can't do this.
9640633	eng	Tom? Can you hear me?
9640706	eng	Our director is a Canadian.
9640707	eng	Our manager is a Canadian.
9640714	eng	Life is the biggest provocation.
9640741	eng	The rats flooded the city.
9640745	eng	They blew up the ATM.
9640749	eng	Did this medication help you?
9640752	eng	I think that'll be fun.
9640763	eng	A child called for help.
9640764	eng	Fish was our next course.
9640775	eng	Why is that so small?
9640797	eng	Tom is one smart cookie.
9640798	eng	Tom is a smart cookie.
9640800	eng	Why don't I remember anything?
9640821	eng	We sat near the fire.
9640842	eng	I can, but I won't.
9640844	eng	I would, but I can't.
9640847	eng	Poetry is difficult to understand.
9640943	eng	You better stop messaging me.
9640988	eng	Maybe Tom didn't do it.
9640991	eng	Thank you for your donation.
9640994	eng	Has Tom ever done this?
9640995	eng	That problem doesn't seem serious.
9641058	eng	That strategy didn't pay off.
9641179	eng	Come to the mosque tonight.
9641180	eng	Come to the mosque today.
9641184	eng	Yanni's house began to burn.
9641185	eng	Incredibly, Yanni is still alive.
9641190	eng	Gladly, Yanni survived the incident.
9641191	eng	Gladly, Yanni survived the accident.
9641196	eng	Yanni lived a painful life.
9641208	eng	Yanni simply destroyed Skura's life.
9641209	eng	Yanni is struggling with life.
9641290	eng	Maybe Tom should do it.
9641302	eng	It seems Tom does this.
9641313	eng	The gift isn't from Yanni.
9641343	eng	Yanni had a perfect life.
9641353	eng	Yanni's life was falling apart.
9641381	eng	Yanni and Skura fought constantly.
9641417	eng	This year has been tough.
9641420	eng	Would you sit with Tom?
9641608	eng	That wasn't the actual plan.
9641704	eng	He lies through his teeth.
9641736	eng	Humans belong to the mammals.
9641738	eng	Your call is being forwarded.
9641804	eng	I can't take jokes anymore.
9641809	eng	I land on my feet.
9641812	eng	We'll never know what happened.
9641819	eng	That may not happen soon.
9641836	eng	Did Tom actually buy these?
9641961	eng	I promised Tom we'd help.
9641975	eng	I hear that a lot.
9641978	eng	We might never find Tom.
9642174	eng	I heard Tom doing this.
9642391	eng	Thank God it's almost over.
9642407	eng	I believe Tom did this.
9642442	eng	Help me carry the suitcases.
9642529	eng	Where did they learn Romanian?
9642587	eng	Why can't I sit here?
9643504	eng	He dragged me into it.
9643522	eng	Your life won't be easy.
9643524	eng	That's how we all feel.
9643526	eng	She put away her phone.
9643844	eng	I wasn't in the city.
9643861	eng	I'm scared to tell him.
9643935	eng	He loves the easy life.
9643945	eng	Maybe they should change it.
9643951	eng	Shoot! I missed the bus.
9643981	eng	We went to the countryside.
9644034	eng	I watched Tom doing it.
9644050	eng	Do they believe in us?
9644213	eng	Tom can't handle the stress.
9644450	eng	You can't brake on snow.
9644452	eng	I simply added some sugar.
9644698	eng	I'll be your tour guide.
9645183	eng	Where will Tom be sleeping?
9645635	eng	What's the science behind it?
9645753	eng	I showed him the exit.
9645772	eng	The training is really strict.
9646104	eng	That timing was almost perfect.
9646789	eng	Composing poetry is an art.
9647033	eng	Who let Tom do that?
9647050	eng	She dreams about an automobile.
9647105	eng	May I take more coffee?
9647208	eng	He is an expert fisherman.
9647338	eng	Tom was overwhelmed by emotion.
9647358	eng	Many beachgoers ignored the warnings.
9647561	eng	Today is my sister's wedding.
9647667	eng	Why haven't you boarded yet?
9647848	eng	A heartfelt thanks for everything!
9647885	eng	I am very nervous today.
9647901	eng	I greeted the police officer.
9647914	eng	This is a black olive.
9647949	eng	Talk about your favorite film.
9647953	eng	We are eating more vegetables.
9647964	eng	I don't believe that rumor.
9647989	eng	That music is very beautiful.
9648054	eng	They are very famous here.
9648114	eng	Children don't have to work.
9648121	eng	No. That is the sun.
9648161	eng	She's not listening to me!
9648181	eng	We're doing well, thank you.
9649659	eng	You should change your password.
9649678	eng	His words hit us deeply.
9649693	eng	What was Tom pointing at?
9649704	eng	Step out of the way!
9649719	eng	Yanni is having an affair.
9649729	eng	He is a reasonable person.
9649779	eng	Being there changed my life.
9649835	eng	I'll be back at sunset.
9649848	eng	Yanni's death shattered many lives.
9649859	eng	We should have another party.
9649871	eng	Please do what you can.
9649885	eng	All dogs are good dogs.
9649888	eng	No one thinks that'll happen.
9650758	eng	I'm not a good loser.
9651526	eng	Thank you. We appreciate it.
9652256	eng	That's a very pertinent question.
9652282	eng	Can you learn Konkani online?
9652609	eng	I drink ouzo every day.
9653169	eng	Everyone seems to be working.
9653534	eng	You should not be going.
9654716	eng	Tom's stepson's name is John.
9655550	eng	I still cannot forgive Tom.
9656032	eng	We'll get this done somehow.
9656249	eng	I lied on her behalf.
9656488	eng	They aren't speaking to Mary.
9656516	eng	He's going to Tokyo tomorrow.
9656536	eng	The wound hasn't healed yet.
9658183	eng	Mary has post-traumatic stress disorder.
9658540	eng	He painted the sitting girl.
9658547	eng	She painted the sitting girl.
9661007	eng	That cat really likes you.
9661012	eng	Our cat really likes you.
9661562	eng	Her name is very beautiful.
9661572	eng	Do you speak Spanish fluently?
9662064	eng	Tom doesn't like to drink.
9662675	eng	Try to understand my position.
9662751	eng	Tom was an excellent singer.
9662789	eng	You're not young like me.
9662793	eng	You're not poor like me.
9662804	eng	Is that still your plan?
9662811	eng	They took out a kidney.
9662820	eng	She looked out the window.
9662825	eng	We talked with almost everybody.
9662837	eng	It's easy to make mistakes.
9662868	eng	They're going to fire me.
9662869	eng	I showed her the exit.
9662872	eng	We imitate the same behaviors.
9662891	eng	You'd better get in bed.
9662909	eng	Me, eat seafood? No way!
9662992	eng	Aren't I a person, too?
9662998	eng	Sign it before sending it.
9663005	eng	I don't work next week.
9663012	eng	Who will govern the country?
9663014	eng	There's more than I thought.
9663016	eng	Don't put the chair there.
9663021	eng	She goes to our school.
9663081	eng	We are the 99 percent.
9663146	eng	I hate him so dearly.
9663150	eng	I'm not joking at all.
9663151	eng	He hurt me so bad.
9663158	eng	Yanni wanted the good life.
9663251	eng	Yanni is away from Algeria.
9663263	eng	Skura's mom instinct kicked in.
9663281	eng	Nobody asked me any questions.
9663315	eng	I just want some space.
9663448	eng	You look so pretty today!
9663467	eng	Yikes, how cold it is!
9663478	eng	Doing that would certainly help.
9663724	eng	Everything that Tom predicted happened.
9663860	eng	Does he still love him?
9664034	eng	We are the ninety-nine percent.
9664277	eng	I'll get you some help.
9664295	eng	He blew the house down.
9664299	eng	It isn't worth getting angry.
9664305	eng	Our problems had just begun.
9664324	eng	Tom doesn't smoke at home.
9664339	eng	They wanted Tom to leave.
9664358	eng	Tom couldn't have foreseen that.
9664402	eng	Silent drones victimize more people.
9664410	eng	Who is in Mary's way?
9664423	eng	Don't listen to his lies!
9664424	eng	Don't listen to her lies!
9664846	eng	Where is the snack section?
9665091	eng	Tom's stepdaughter's name is Mary.
9665108	eng	Dr. Jackson performed the operation.
9665143	eng	I cried for many nights.
9665160	eng	I was sharpening the knife.
9665173	eng	Who sold that to you?
9665174	eng	Who sold Tom his car?
9665213	eng	We're busier today than usual.
9665258	eng	Let's do what Tom suggested.
9665428	eng	This is a shady garden.
9665749	eng	These books are the best.
9665877	eng	I'm not a vegetarian anymore.
9665918	eng	Let's get fewer material things.
9665936	eng	It's eating me up inside.
9665965	eng	I wanted coffee, not tea.
9666004	eng	They settled their differences calmly.
9666138	eng	I urgently need some money.
9666148	eng	I always talk to them.
9666150	eng	I'm fed up with them.
9666177	eng	Where did you learn Dutch?
9666193	eng	See you soon, my friend!
9666196	eng	You can keep your name.
9666316	eng	The snow started to melt.
9666350	eng	I was blackmailed by Tom.
9667033	eng	I eat eggs every morning.
9667108	eng	Yes, that must be beer.
9667146	eng	I forgot my backpack somewhere.
9667457	eng	I prefer dogs over people.
9667695	eng	Where did you learn Latin?
9667719	eng	This looks like Tom's work.
9667727	eng	This shirt is 100% polyester.
9667780	eng	I really don't like children.
9667781	eng	I really don't like kids.
9667784	eng	I really can't stand kids.
9667806	eng	It's clear he abandoned us.
9667836	eng	Everything she says is true.
9667844	eng	They should arrive by noon.
9667877	eng	He was destined for greatness.
9667882	eng	I can't ski that well.
9667918	eng	Tom bought a new robe.
9667923	eng	What vegetarian dishes you have?
9667949	eng	I shredded some important documents.
9667952	eng	Let's end here for today.
9667968	eng	The police officers surrounded Tom.
9667989	eng	Those two guitars look similar.
9668025	eng	I was happy to help.
9668070	eng	Don't let it affect you.
9668080	eng	I don't recognize that car.
9668084	eng	Why do you hate Canadians?
9668092	eng	They have an orange cat.
9668093	eng	They have a brown cat.
9668094	eng	Writing poetry is an art.
9668106	eng	Can you learn French online?
9668107	eng	Can you learn cooking online?
9668111	eng	We talked with almost everyone.
9668147	eng	When will Tom get back?
9668237	eng	I bought it in Australia.
9668242	eng	You're Mary's husband, aren't you?
9668245	eng	I've sold my old guitar.
9668247	eng	I drove to work today.
9668250	eng	Please leave the door unlocked.
9668255	eng	This isn't worth much money.
9668256	eng	This pillow is too soft.
9668257	eng	Do you have a band-aid?
9668258	eng	I haven't been eating well.
9668260	eng	Why are we studying geology?
9668261	eng	I'll give you three guesses.
9668263	eng	I like that it's cold.
9668274	eng	You don't need to study.
9668276	eng	All you do is eat.
9668292	eng	It has to start sometime.
9668295	eng	There's somebody waiting for me.
9668299	eng	I don't understand this title.
9668308	eng	Remember to close the windows.
9668309	eng	His eyes revealed his fear.
9668312	eng	I don't have any more.
9668318	eng	Don't you feel anything here?
9668321	eng	It doesn't look too complicated.
9668327	eng	We've spent all the money.
9668345	eng	He took it from us.
9668349	eng	Are my pictures ready now?
9668361	eng	She won't eat or drink.
9668362	eng	She doesn't eat or drink.
9668372	eng	The text hasn't been checked.
9668376	eng	Cut the meat into strips.
9668390	eng	I think he'll go out.
9668395	eng	Maybe you just misunderstood me.
9668400	eng	I'm not done watching it.
9668404	eng	We stared at her, bewildered.
9668411	eng	Let's buy one for him.
9668418	eng	The wall clock doesn't work.
9668421	eng	I'll never eat it again.
9668449	eng	That accident caused many deaths.
9668456	eng	They'll get married in June.
9668465	eng	That parking lot is free.
9668505	eng	They won't dare touch you.
9668568	eng	Yanni's life was in turmoil.
9668631	eng	You are right, as always.
9668674	eng	Meeting Tom lifted my spirits.
9668730	eng	Yanni pushed Skura too hard.
9668750	eng	Yanni had an eagle eye.
9668752	eng	Yanni stood trial in 2004.
9668763	eng	Beauty may only be skin-deep.
9668775	eng	I only ate one banana.
9668780	eng	Yanni fell for Skura's charms.
9668785	eng	The police arrested the kidnapper.
9668791	eng	Yanni was thirsty for blood.
9668797	eng	Neither of them is pretty.
9668815	eng	Till here and no further!
9668832	eng	That artist is very popular.
9668855	eng	Yanni was in the spotlight.
9668866	eng	Last month was very rainy.
9668869	eng	Tom caught a small fish.
9668876	eng	We're going to Australia tomorrow.
9668882	eng	I'm left on the shelf.
9668915	eng	Apple trees have beautiful blossoms.
9668939	eng	Nobody came to help us.
9668945	eng	I only saw him briefly.
9668964	eng	My heart belongs to England.
9668986	eng	What are the other choices?
9668987	eng	Is there any good news?
9668989	eng	I don't like boiled eggs.
9668992	eng	Life won't be easy there.
9668994	eng	It's been nearly three hours.
9668995	eng	It's been almost three hours.
9668999	eng	The weather will improve eventually.
9669000	eng	I'm looking for my wife.
9669003	eng	Are you sure it's yours?
9669009	eng	I've been feeling tired lately.
9669014	eng	The laundry isn't dry yet.
9669016	eng	The laundry isn't yet dry.
9669019	eng	Where are my red socks?
9669024	eng	You're a very naughty boy.
9669047	eng	Sunday is his day off.
9669053	eng	Tom has started smoking again.
9669058	eng	Why aren't you ever satisfied?
9669063	eng	You've been under a spell.
9669065	eng	I was having a dream.
9669068	eng	Does anybody have a question?
9669098	eng	He invited a pretty girl.
9669122	eng	He doesn't get enough money.
9669135	eng	I think that's partially true.
9669162	eng	I don't know much French.
9669176	eng	Today's Tom and Mary's wedding.
9669253	eng	No students arrived on time.
9669704	eng	Tom isn't afraid of mice.
9669929	eng	Nobody has done it yet.
9669955	eng	There is some fish there.
9670045	eng	Tom couldn't find the cottage.
9670099	eng	Come listen to the radio!
9670102	eng	He's writing a new novel.
9670105	eng	Xoán is a good student.
9670113	eng	Tom isn't Mary's manager anymore.
9670134	eng	Don't play with her feelings.
9670142	eng	The data supports the theory.
9670148	eng	I enjoy reading crime novels.
9670180	eng	Now the vacation is over.
9670189	eng	Is this your fountain pen?
9670200	eng	The government’s coffers are empty.
9670242	eng	She loves to cook food.
9670249	eng	She found a dead person.
9670257	eng	I'm just here to help.
9670274	eng	I'm just here to visit.
9670313	eng	The shoes are too small.

9670557	eng	I will go to Italy.
9670723	eng	I can't pay that much.
9670725	eng	Tom isn't still in Boston.

9670752	eng	How much did you spend?
9670833	eng	Tom put away his phone.
9670838	eng	Nobody asked me for anything.
9670891	eng	We won't leave you behind.
9670928	eng	I spent all my money.
9670931	eng	I'll do it next week.
9670935	eng	Tom isn't a crazy person.
9670968	eng	It's important to keep busy.
9671002	eng	I was at my parents'.
9671020	eng	Everything was clear and simple.
9671051	eng	Ears are necessary to hear.
9671061	eng	When were you a soldier?
9671167	eng	Tom asked for my permission.

9671468	eng	Yanni could not take rejection.
9671470	eng	Yanni was in deep trouble.
9671477	eng	Yanni has choir practice tonight.
9671500	eng	Yanni was flying into trouble.
9671505	eng	Yanni forged his father's will.
9671506	eng	Why is all this talking?
9671541	eng	Tom isn't a drummer, either.
9671597	eng	That is kind of sad.
9671703	eng	Tom isn't faster than us.
9671893	eng	Maisie will go to Izmir.
9672018	eng	I could probably help you.
9672216	eng	Tom wasn't listening to me.
9672312	eng	Tom lives in the village.
9672345	eng	Why haven't you had breakfast?
9672407	eng	England is an excellent country.
9672416	eng	He insists on his right.
9672756	eng	You never wash the floor.
9672832	eng	You're looking for a job.
9672907	eng	I won't pay that much.
9672913	eng	Tom would prefer to stay.
9672929	eng	I'm starting to miss you.
9672930	eng	I'm starting to miss Tom.
9672980	eng	We live in different universes.
9672985	eng	I sent Tom a letter.
9672987	eng	Tom likes to read tabloids.
9672998	eng	Look! It's a bald eagle.
9673028	eng	Happiness and glass break easily.
9673035	eng	Our work is never finished.
9673039	eng	I go to Turkey tomorrow.
9673048	eng	I don't like any hats.

9673074	eng	What country is Tom from?
9673081	eng	Tom said he'd rather stay.
9673094	eng	I am very sad now.
9673099	eng	He married for the money.
9673104	eng	I participated in the celebration.
9673108	eng	Some cathedrals were formerly mosques.
9673158	eng	How does the soup taste?
9673165	eng	She enjoys Russian pop music.
9673166	eng	Does the soup taste OK?

9673923	eng	We have to see Tom.
9673992	eng	No one can stand Tom.
9674218	eng	Would you sit with me?
9674382	eng	Tom can go with me.
9674451	eng	No one except Tom survived.

9675264	eng	What do the glasses cost?
9675271	eng	I gave you a house.
9675288	eng	We need a backup plan.
9675291	eng	Tom has a new hat.
9675298	eng	That is just a dream.
9675302	eng	I am smaller than him.
9675304	eng	I am shorter than him.
9675386	eng	One should obey their parents.
9675395	eng	We should follow the rules.
9675438	eng	Come as quickly as possible.

9676469	eng	You'd better get dressed now.
9676472	eng	It shouldn't happen that way.
9676475	eng	You have to protect Tom.
9676478	eng	You don't sound too happy.
9676530	eng	Tom camped in Mary's yard.
9676559	eng	Yanni changed Skura's life forever.
9676562	eng	Skura is no ordinary girl.

9676586	eng	She practices typing every day.
9676590	eng	I don't charge for overtime.
9676593	eng	It's normal to fall down.
9676611	eng	I showed him some music.
9676645	eng	Few people speak Spanish there.
9676687	eng	Tom made a wrong move.
9676784	eng	Hypocrisy is Tom's middle name.
9676789	eng	Yanni showered Skura in luxury.
9676790	eng	Yanni lavished Skura with jewelry.
9676821	eng	Honestly, I think it's hopeless.
9676869	eng	I live close to Harvard.
9676881	eng	We have to protect Tom.
9676883	eng	Imagine crowdfunding your entire life.
9676901	eng	Yanni has wrecked Skura's life.
9676922	eng	It's not me, it's you!
9676928	eng	He hugged the horse's neck.
9676966	eng	If I'm mistaken, correct me.
9677021	eng	Yanni's life is in turmoil.
9677089	eng	Tom looks a little sad.
9677122	eng	CPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation.
9677130	eng	Yanni still calls Algiers home.
9677200	eng	Yanni was a stone-cold sociopath.
9677218	eng	I won't help him anymore.
9677280	eng	Tom was scared for Mary.
9677286	eng	You have to plan ahead.
9677366	eng	Here's the most obvious question.
9677454	eng	Simple language is good language.
9677528	eng	I don't have time today.
9677629	eng	That's neither here nor there.
9677637	eng	Has Tom been in touch?
9677754	eng	Tom has just gone inside.
9677762	eng	That's part of our heritage.
9677868	eng	He should've listened to them.
9677921	eng	Tom drowned in this lake.
9677925	eng	This gift isn't from Tom.
9678126	eng	It wasn't a close game.
9678130	eng	Tom let the dog outside.
9678136	eng	See what Tom is doing.
9678169	eng	However, I don't know it.
9678190	eng	What size is his girlfriend.
9678201	eng	He's gotten on the bus.
9678204	eng	I doubt that it's over.
9678218	eng	Maya lives with her parents.
9678220	eng	We're tired of your complaining.
9678221	eng	Did you do the homework?
9678227	eng	I play baseball with pleasure.
9678257	eng	Is he throwing away everything?
9678258	eng	Franko has navy blue jeans.
9678259	eng	Everyone's made of different materials.
9678301	eng	Tom kept the store open.
9678391	eng	There are no loose ends.
9678484	eng	Tom walks a great deal.
9678697	eng	He's always wearing thick clothes.
9678830	eng	Tom may need some assistance.
9678835	eng	You need to protect Tom.
9678886	eng	Tom made me feel great.
9678928	eng	Tom goes to our school.
9678965	eng	Learning German is tough work.
9678966	eng	I'm ashamed I did it.
9678979	eng	They're looking for my book.
9678986	eng	The baby was born healthy.
9678993	eng	Tom's feet are very dirty.
9678997	eng	This should last for generations.
9678998	eng	It's not your turn yet.
9679001	eng	What shall I tell Tom?
9679014	eng	Watch out. The man's armed.
9679015	eng	Well, I want another coffee.
9679019	eng	Your shirt is soaking wet.
9679059	eng	Tom looked a little sad.
9679060	eng	Nobody sits in the front.
9679062	eng	Finding Tom's house wasn't easy.
9679069	eng	We're not open on Mondays.
9679090	eng	Tom dragged me into it.
9679095	eng	French isn't spoken here anymore.
9679124	eng	Doctors and nurses save lives.
9679156	eng	Yanni began controlling Skura's life.
9679162	eng	That'll happen in due time.
9679211	eng	Yanni had a normal life.
9679261	eng	Yanni's life was worth that.
9679293	eng	Nobody will buy this stuff.
9679513	eng	Tom's book didn't get published.
9679518	eng	Tom was given a raise.
9679576	eng	Tom is a French student.
9679585	eng	Maybe we should buy less.
9679617	eng	Tom needs a bigger size.
9679715	eng	Tom knows how to count.
9679717	eng	Tom offered us some help.
9679741	eng	His goatee was too thin.
9679742	eng	Women don't have a goatee.
9679743	eng	Some women have a mustache.
9679745	eng	The tipser did not survive.
9679746	eng	The tipster was a stranger.
9679955	eng	Tom is at a conference.
9680133	eng	What should I prepare for?
9680390	eng	Mary broke up with him.
9680402	eng	Tom wants a better life.
9680411	eng	Tom's feet were very dirty.
9680413	eng	What can we find inside?
9680427	eng	I was at her place.
9680721	eng	Tom's dog was with him.
9680757	eng	I support the National Team.
9680781	eng	I was having similar feelings.
9680816	eng	He's smart, but not wise.
9680902	eng	I expected more of Tom.
9681089	eng	When is your lunch break?
9681092	eng	Do you know his wife?
9681176	eng	A salesperson doesn't earn much.
9681282	eng	Hydropower doesn't emit greenhouse gases.
9681326	eng	Why am I being fined?
9681425	eng	Three halves is six quarters.
9681469	eng	They changed the meeting room.
9681516	eng	She can speak ten languages.
9681563	eng	Chances are I'll be awake.
9681638	eng	Tom ran after the bus.
9681668	eng	You've done a wonderful job.
9681669	eng	You shouldn't rely on others.
9681673	eng	Tom's hands were very dirty.
9681722	eng	It's great to be alive.
9681738	eng	This is all very strange.
9681769	eng	Tom lent Mary some money.
9681798	eng	Tom needs a smaller size.
9681838	eng	That's really a great question.
9681859	eng	They didn't die in vain.
9681862	eng	Everyone wants you to die.
9681866	eng	Nobody wants to die alone.
9681872	eng	Many soldiers died that day.
9681884	eng	We're not afraid to die.
9681885	eng	We aren't afraid to die.
9681923	eng	Those thoughts didn't last long.
9681941	eng	Tom lives on a farm.
9682105	eng	Tom spent three days here.
9682243	eng	Yanni cared for his father.
9682258	eng	Yanni's good life was short-lived.
9682261	eng	Yanni's depression bubbled to anger.
9682268	eng	Yanni wanted to sedate Skura.
9682269	eng	Yanni wanted to drug Skura.
9682270	eng	Yanni tried to sedate Skura.
9682271	eng	Yanni tried to drug Skura.
9682282	eng	Yanni went inside the home.
9682289	eng	Tom's hands are very dirty.
9682303	eng	Yanni was high on drugs.
9682314	eng	Yanni's frustration turned to fury.
9682316	eng	Yanni did something totally senseless.
9682340	eng	Yanni was off the hook.
9682401	eng	Yanni paid that no mind.
9682429	eng	That morning changed my life.
9682446	eng	They know what they want.
9682449	eng	You can do without this.
9682479	eng	I kept missing Tom's calls.
9682488	eng	Yanni has started pumping iron.
9682513	eng	Yanni's business hit hard times.
9682516	eng	Yanni is a tough cookie.
9682517	eng	Yanni is a strange duck.
9682608	eng	Yanni left nothing to chance.
9682627	eng	We just need proper funding.
9682709	eng	Do you want that soufflé?
9682721	eng	I'm just gonna sit here.
9682747	eng	How many people were standing?
9682749	eng	Why wouldn't Tom help us?
9683134	eng	Tom is a glory seeker.
9683390	eng	Are there earthquakes on Mars?
9683413	eng	We have supper at eight.
9683561	eng	Find something to stay busy.
9683612	eng	It could change, of course.
9683772	eng	Many of you are disappointed.
9683787	eng	He's upset the apple cart.
9683789	eng	She's upset the apple cart.
9683872	eng	But this list is blank.
9683908	eng	He's known all over town.
9683956	eng	I keep missing Tom's calls.
9683979	eng	Leave something for me too.
9684004	eng	Tom is a creative thinker.
9684305	eng	That's not why we work.
9684370	eng	Tom gave money to Mary.
9684375	eng	You'll see that I'm right.
9684377	eng	I'll tell Tom we're ready.
9684379	eng	People can't live without oxygen.
9684382	eng	You'll succeed in the end.
9684393	eng	You're all our guests tonight.
9684397	eng	You're both pretty and kind.
9684439	eng	You're wrong in some respects.
9684623	eng	Tom will be there soon.
9684626	eng	We're looking for Tom's car.
9684681	eng	You look unhappy. What's wrong?
9684702	eng	You should've started by now.
9684714	eng	You'd better see the doctor.
9684736	eng	Let's not think about that.
9684751	eng	You're no longer a child.
9684756	eng	You're nothing but a student.
9684841	eng	Nobody is interested in that.
9684882	eng	Tom was running the show.
9684903	eng	Tigers don't make good pets.
9684918	eng	I'll never eat here again.
9684940	eng	Does everyone have a pencil?
9684962	eng	Few people speak French there.
9684963	eng	Few people speak French here.
9685032	eng	I'm not really into dancing.
9685038	eng	Tom thought for a moment.
9685046	eng	Tom enjoys walking to work.
9685214	eng	Perhaps I could help you.
9685391	eng	Tom's dog ate my sandwich.
9685404	eng	I had an unexpected lead.
9685420	eng	Everything you cook is delicious.
9685426	eng	Watch your tone of voice.
9685440	eng	Tom talked to the teacher.
9685446	eng	It probably won't happen today.
9685457	eng	Can we have some privacy?
9685472	eng	That is so much fun.
9685510	eng	These mittens are very warm.
9685512	eng	That orchard is very beautiful!
9685531	eng	We invited Tom to stay.
9685605	eng	That sounds sort of silly.
9685879	eng	Don't twist my words around!
9686438	eng	Tom is a weak-willed person.
9686553	eng	You'll always find me honest.
9686935	eng	I know absolutely no French.
9687005	eng	We need to buy time.
9687006	eng	Tom is thinner than Mary.
9687014	eng	You need to distract yourself.
9687015	eng	What was I thinking about?
9687030	eng	The concert didn't last long.
9687042	eng	Did you wash the dishes?
9687050	eng	We don't believe that's true.
9687059	eng	Why are you sitting down?
9687076	eng	I suggest that we leave.
9687096	eng	You smell like cigarette smoke.
9687102	eng	Pay close attention to teachers.
9687108	eng	I will let her go.
9687110	eng	They are about to go.
9687118	eng	Tom is heavier than Mary.
9687199	eng	"You look fantastic." "Thank you."
9687214	eng	Yanni's scheme is downright diabolical.
9687227	eng	Yanni's wife bled him dry.
9687245	eng	Yanni ran into a problem.
9687259	eng	Skura had a wild streak.
9687260	eng	Skura was wild at heart.
9687395	eng	The choice is entirely yours.
9687400	eng	Tom is the ideal candidate.
9687438	eng	Yanni is famous in Algeria.
9687447	eng	Let people live normal life.
9687452	eng	The police are onto something.
9687473	eng	She has an eating disorder.
9687503	eng	Tom was holding a jug.
9687508	eng	Let's deal with that first.
9687763	eng	He took a wrong turn.
9687887	eng	The truth is slowly surfacing.
9687942	eng	I called Tom this morning.
9688141	eng	Have you found the murderer?
9688188	eng	Vinegar is a good cleaner.
9688316	eng	Hungarian practically has eighteen cases.
9688479	eng	Of course, we'll blame Tom.
9688592	eng	Did you find the killer?
9688653	eng	My mother is an alcoholic.
9688915	eng	Tom usually drives to school.
9689166	eng	These edges are quite jagged.
9689315	eng	I have just turned twenty.
9689332	eng	The fire destroyed ten houses.
9689341	eng	I only know his name.
9689360	eng	She gave the cat milk.
9689390	eng	Tom sold everything he had.
9689625	eng	We looked at that boy.
9689626	eng	We look at that boy.
9689700	eng	Maybe Tom should change that.
9689784	eng	Yanni fell into icy water.
9689787	eng	Tom has lots of shirts.
9689805	eng	Yanni started plotting Skura's murder.
9689813	eng	Skura's desires know no boundaries.
9689814	eng	Yanni is playing with fire.
9689815	eng	Yanni gave Skura mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
9689835	eng	Ask Tom to come immediately.
9689882	eng	Yanni was under Skura's spell.

10141168	eng	That isn't fair, is it?
10141262	eng	We put on our helmets.
10141288	eng	Tom didn't hear Mary crying.

10142012	eng	You're completely and utterly right.
10142017	eng	He's pretending to be asleep.

10142201	eng	Why is he so thin?
10142205	eng	Why is she so thin?
10142215	eng	Tom buckled his seat belt.

10142613	eng	Tom adjusted his rearview mirror.
10142640	eng	Tom didn't leave a will.
10142645	eng	We now regret our decision.
10142694	eng	Tom needs to see this.
10142766	eng	We feared for our safety.
10142788	eng	Do you like punk rock?
10142790	eng	Tom ate his lunch alone.
10142795	eng	We need to borrow this.
10142796	eng	Tom went trick-or-treating with Mary.

10143829	eng	Tom runs a used bookstore.
10143830	eng	Do you want to trade?
10143831	eng	The tea is too strong.
10143852	eng	Talk some sense into him.
10143853	eng	Rough him up a bit.
10143908	eng	We put on our hats.
10143927	eng	That isn't annoying to me.
10143985	eng	We won't sell our land.
10143992	eng	Tom went to meet Mary.
10144195	eng	We just sold our car.

10144957	eng	Our dog is called "Poppy".
10145021	eng	I'dn't've done it without you.
10145111	eng	That's not the actual plan.
10145201	eng	We're here with our families.
10145294	eng	Give the correct answer immediately.
10145421	eng	We all paid our bills.
10145670	eng	That isn't saying a lot.
10145677	eng	We're trying our best here.
10145683	eng	We're on our way out.
10145685	eng	Tom didn't eat anything either.
10145701	eng	Tom was swimming with Mary.
10145705	eng	Tom didn't like Mary either.
10145746	eng	That isn't what I saw.

10145765	eng	You're exactly like your father.
10145770	eng	We need to leave today.
10145791	eng	That's my hope as well.
10145824	eng	Tom asked about the others.
10145981	eng	Tom tested positive for COVID-19.
10146076	eng	That isn't really a solution.
10146098	eng	Tom hasn't been behaving himself.
10146175	eng	That's not Tom's only secret.
10146259	eng	I looked at Tom's boots.
10146281	eng	Tom pretended to be listening.
10146662	eng	Tom was doing his best.
10146788	eng	That isn't the real problem.
10146891	eng	We live with our father.
10146894	eng	Tom went to a funeral.
10147024	eng	That isn't the case anymore.
10147045	eng	We took our shoes off.
10147134	eng	Tom had them all shot.
10147138	eng	I heard a commotion upstairs.
10147162	eng	My cough has gotten worse.
10147164	eng	Tom needs immediate medical attention.
10147165	eng	You shouldn't go that fast.
10147170	eng	Do you have any ice?
10147172	eng	The ice is quickly melting.
10147181	eng	What's in it for Tom?
10147186	eng	We know you did it.
10147210	eng	My phone was very expensive.
10147221	eng	It wasn't all that entertaining.
10147225	eng	They're working on the problem.
10147230	eng	They put me on hold.
10147236	eng	Tom's video got taken down.
10147242	eng	I wrote Tom a PM.
10147244	eng	I emailed Tom about it.
10147245	eng	Tom mostly keeps to himself.
10147285	eng	It was a total loss.
10147299	eng	I know a good mechanic.
10147304	eng	Tom was covering for Mary.
10147347	eng	The criminals managed to escape.
10147359	eng	He found an old diskette.
10147400	eng	We're proud of our school.
10147434	eng	Tom is a real busybody.
10147435	eng	Tom likes to snoop around.
10147439	eng	Tom was covered in sweat.
10147451	eng	How do you open this?
10147460	eng	Some people just shouldn't sing.
10147461	eng	Your singing voice is terrible.
10147472	eng	I'll make it next time.
10147473	eng	I'll be there. I promise.
10147475	eng	Tom didn't see that happen.
10147487	eng	It was just a warm-up.
10147503	eng	Tom has a partner, John.
10147511	eng	Your words warm my heart.
10147522	eng	We usually lock our car.
10147547	eng	Tom went to Boston, too.
10147593	eng	We washed our car yesterday.
10147652	eng	Tom didn't steal Mary's stuff.
10147680	eng	We didn't see Tom anywhere.
10147686	eng	Is that what she means?
10147732	eng	We need to take baths.
10147802	eng	Tom went there every day.
10147846	eng	We couldn't find the bomb.
10147879	eng	You may rely on her.
10147881	eng	I want to want it.
10147937	eng	We let our teammates down.
10147947	eng	We've lost our health insurance.
10148002	eng	That isn't where I'm going.
10148049	eng	We put our hats on.
10148056	eng	Tom went to the cafe.
10148117	eng	We didn't get our wish.
10148157	eng	Tom went down the ladder.
10148196	eng	Good luck breeding those lions.
10148201	eng	We're investing in our future.
10148213	eng	Tom was experiencing hellish pain.
10148214	eng	Traveling with friends is fun.
10148239	eng	The instructions were in French.
10148241	eng	The lecture was in French.
10148243	eng	Tom was wearing a bandana.
10148254	eng	Tom did his French homework.
10148287	eng	It was a dusky night.
10148296	eng	I could eat a cow.
10148313	eng	August is named after Augustus.
10148318	eng	That isn't why I'm late.
10148327	eng	Tom went to get food.
10148331	eng	Tom went to the authorities.
10148340	eng	We aren't good at math.
10148342	eng	This summer is really hot.
10148343	eng	It's really hot this summer.
10148346	eng	This tank holds thirty liters.
10148356	eng	What's wrong? You look worried.
10148362	eng	We put our gloves on.
10148385	eng	Let's buy Tom this one.
10148395	eng	A complaint has been sent.
10148397	eng	We didn't lose our tempers.
10148399	eng	We've just sold our car.
10148407	eng	The U.S. was a mistake.
10148409	eng	Tom went on a cruise.
10148439	eng	That isn't what we did.
10148696	eng	We put on our gloves.
10148733	eng	We really love our work.
10148757	eng	We really miss our mom.
10148976	eng	She only talks about them.
10148979	eng	He only talks about them.
10149073	eng	Tom took revenge on society.
10149241	eng	Yanni's life is in Algeria.
10149243	eng	Yanni got deported from Algeria.
10149265	eng	Yanni goes to Algeria sometimes.
10149323	eng	She was one of them.
10149330	eng	Yanni is heading to Algeria.
10149430	eng	That's not Tom's main reason.
10149434	eng	Tom did this for Mary.
10149438	eng	We turned off our phones.
10149599	eng	Actually, I don't like America.
10149604	eng	We need to finish it.
10149692	eng	We've lost all our money.
10149712	eng	We stayed in our room.
10149752	eng	They won't stop interrupting me.
10149768	eng	He has a credit card.
10149771	eng	She has a credit card.
10149794	eng	Have a good week, darling.
10149831	eng	We got to our feet.
10149878	eng	We make our own decisions.
10149879	eng	That's not acceptable to Tom.
10149998	eng	Let's see what Tom thinks.
10150024	eng	America is an illegitimate state.
10150076	eng	That isn't what it means.
10150080	eng	Tom hasn't seen this yet.
10150152	eng	We want our money now.
10150212	eng	Wait until it comes closer.
10150419	eng	That isn't a tough decision.
10150787	eng	Stop doing this right now.
10150921	eng	That isn't what I want.
10150925	eng	Tom went down the street.
10151015	eng	We took off our gloves.
10151030	eng	Tom went to the movies.
10151076	eng	Do you have hydrogen peroxide?
10151139	eng	Don't give anyone our address.
10151152	eng	Where do you buy books?
10151172	eng	Do you know history well?
10151223	eng	We're on our way over.
10151224	eng	I really like staying home.
10151229	eng	That isn't what's happening here.
10151245	eng	Actually, I don't like Tom.
10151255	eng	The clothes aren't dry yet.
10151257	eng	That isn't what worries me.
10151269	eng	I'm not obsessed with money.
10151290	eng	That isn't what I mean.
10151297	eng	We need to move slowly.
10151359	eng	That isn't the best example.
10151402	eng	Why are you always happy?
10151408	eng	It'll take me all day.
10151481	eng	We passed all our exams.
10151509	eng	I'm glad you've returned safely.
10151616	eng	Algerians like to eat couscous.
10151621	eng	Yanni ate all the couscous.
10151640	eng	"Can you cook couscous?" "Sure!"
10151804	eng	I have my own ideas.
10151828	eng	This is her favorite flower.
10151831	eng	This is his favorite flower.
10151861	eng	Is that all we have?
10151892	eng	This is my second wife.
10151894	eng	This is my second husband.
10151895	eng	This is my first wife.
10151896	eng	This is my first husband.
10151913	eng	Tom did some stretching exercises.
10151929	eng	Is he afraid of them?
10151934	eng	Nobody has seen Tom today.
10151962	eng	Tom didn't notice the difference.
10151969	eng	Tom is in a cult.
10152009	eng	The green umbrella is Tom's.
10152073	eng	That isn't good for business.
10152104	eng	That sounds really interesting, actually.
10152114	eng	Are the fires still burning?
10152115	eng	Tom was convicted of arson.
10152136	eng	The pandemic is not over.
10152165	eng	We got our money's worth.
10152194	eng	We're at our wit's end.
10152231	eng	We've just lost our jobs.
10152281	eng	Tom didn't win the lottery.
10152312	eng	Clean up after you're done.
10152356	eng	That isn't what we're about.
10152402	eng	We always keep our promises.
10152443	eng	They confiscated everything I had.
10152514	eng	That isn't in the file.
10152593	eng	That's a really big fish.
10152594	eng	That's a really big one.
10152620	eng	Let's make Tom do that.
10152678	eng	That was an awkward silence.
10152791	eng	I think I'm an addict.
10152841	eng	It's not a common sight.
10152846	eng	I think the website's down.

10153026	eng	How much can you bench?
10153037	eng	Those socks look really warm.
10153040	eng	Do you need these papers?
10153086	eng	Don't click on suspicious links.
10153127	eng	Tom was covered in dirt.
10153134	eng	We'll be on our own.
10153165	eng	Luckily Tom didn't see me.

10465180	eng	Should we have some tea?
10465191	eng	Please stop using that term.
10465192	eng	Tom isn't in the cafeteria.
10465199	eng	Tom wasn't involved in that.
10465251	eng	How dare you disobey me!
10465257	eng	Tom disobeyed a direct order.
10465293	eng	Are you really from Australia?
10465344	eng	Tom's high as a kite.
10465368	eng	I'll try not to forget.
10465407	eng	Let's sit on this bench.
10465413	eng	We sang a beautiful song.
10465433	eng	A decade is ten years.
10465435	eng	I won't take another step.
10465443	eng	Portugal had a great empire.
10465475	eng	Hope only makes us sad.
10465641	eng	This isn't water. It's kerosene.
10465683	eng	How much do they want?
10465880	eng	The transmission quality was satisfactory.
10466023	eng	Mary and I are sisters.
10466185	eng	Learning foreign languages is difficult.
10466197	eng	Learning Ido is very easy.
10466267	eng	Tom wasn't nice at all.
10466321	eng	Humans are apes with clothes.
10466476	eng	Tom is a celebrity here.
10466858	eng	Watch out! A lorry's coming!
10466886	eng	The breakdown van has arrived.
10466899	eng	He'll be here before long.
10466900	eng	It'll be here before long.
10466943	eng	I don't like shrimps much.
10466944	eng	Militarism was ubiquitous in Prussia.
10466945	eng	Militarism in Prussia was pervasive.
10466959	eng	They don't sing particularly well.
10466960	eng	You don't sing particularly well.
10466961	eng	You're not singing very well.
10466967	eng	You're not singing any more.
10466975	eng	The dog's name is John.
10467015	eng	This complaining has to stop.
10467021	eng	Is Tom really from Australia?
10467076	eng	Your boy is very talented.
10467151	eng	Did Tom get a receipt?
10467480	eng	I hope that you're kidding.
10467797	eng	You're from a different generation.
10467808	eng	Yesterday I received her letter.
10467857	eng	Do you want some sugar?
10467867	eng	My coffee is too hot.
10467883	eng	Skura and Nuja are grounded.
10467884	eng	Sophia has three large glasses.
10467890	eng	Sophia speaks Polish and Czech.
10467906	eng	Are you in North America?
10467938	eng	You eat too much meat.
10467945	eng	We like strawberries so much!
10467956	eng	Tom wasn't upset at all.
10467960	eng	I can smell the oranges.
10468041	eng	Are the two horses yours?
10468062	eng	This city's name is Arras.
10468098	eng	Something is about to happen.
10468124	eng	I'm talking about our house.
10468162	eng	Somebody's at the back door.
10468207	eng	He saved his own life.
10468212	eng	This is not a shrimp.
10468244	eng	Tom is a born-again vegan.
10468268	eng	Tom isn't living here anymore.
10468694	eng	He couldn't finish the sandwich.
10469042	eng	What, does the truth hurt?
10469689	eng	Kids grow up really fast.
10469714	eng	I got the date wrong.
10469808	eng	Students may use these computers.
10469840	eng	The sharp whistle deafened Tom.
10469870	eng	I'm going the other way.
10469878	eng	Tom scurried into the courtyard.
10469950	eng	Forbidden fruit is the sweetest.
10469973	eng	Tom isn't a good man.
10469975	eng	For supper, I cooked spaghetti.
10470156	eng	Who's a little cutie pie?
10470198	eng	You're such a disgusting mug.
10470261	eng	He left just in time.
10470269	eng	I mixed up the dates.
10470434	eng	Pupils may use these computers.
10470459	eng	We shouldn't wait for Tom.
10470492	eng	The inhabitants fled the city.
10470586	eng	This has to stop now.
10470590	eng	Tom isn't like his sister.
10470688	eng	I'll lie on the floor.
10470729	eng	Tom isn't able to move.
10470840	eng	Tom won't be leaving tonight.
10470959	eng	My pants have four pockets.
10471052	eng	Tom was on our team.
10471194	eng	What does Tom not like?
10471257	eng	Why did you provoke Tom?
10471320	eng	Tom isn't doing that yet.
10471339	eng	Don't trust Tom, trust me.
10471365	eng	For supper, I'll cook spaghetti.
10471377	eng	He is an old man.
10471430	eng	Did Tom brush his teeth?
10471797	eng	Alex is a non-binary person.
10471927	eng	We should continue doing this.
10472052	eng	Let's not be like them.
10472062	eng	This discovery became a sensation.
10472104	eng	Improvisation is an unpredictable thing.
10472112	eng	The reservoirs are filling up.
10472162	eng	It was a tactless question.
10472209	eng	There may be manufacturing defects.
10472221	eng	He mows with wide strokes.
10472223	eng	I just formatted my computer.
10472246	eng	This is a trial batch.
10472266	eng	It was Tom's father's decision.
10472273	eng	Tom isn't listening to you.
10472332	eng	I'd gladly go with you.
10472617	eng	Does this price include meals?
10472628	eng	Tom doesn't stay on topic.
10472657	eng	We could've seen it coming.
10472658	eng	They could've seen it coming.
10472673	eng	Tom's back to winning ways.
10472780	eng	We must win this game.
10472783	eng	It's a matter of concern.
10472795	eng	That didn't matter to Tom.
10472799	eng	That didn't seem to matter.
10472800	eng	It didn't matter that much.
10472861	eng	This Esperantist doesn't speak English.
10472865	eng	I know the three girls.
10472931	eng	I'm not paying for that.
10472956	eng	Filipinos are not like Swiss.
10472980	eng	You did well. Good job.
10472993	eng	What was Tom arrested for?
10472995	eng	Mary might not attack us.
10473004	eng	Don't give them false hope.
10473014	eng	Milk is a complete food.
10473030	eng	Why do I need shoes?
10473035	eng	I didn't need safety goggles.
10473039	eng	I need a pillow case.
10473040	eng	You give it to me.
10473043	eng	I didn't need protective goggles.
10473046	eng	I didn't need safety glasses.
10473080	eng	The Romans were skilled engineers.
10473083	eng	The stork started to clatter.
10473149	eng	When is Tom going shopping?
10473433	eng	Hopefully, it'll continue this way.
10473477	eng	The street is very wide.
10473480	eng	Tom squirmed like a worm.
10473508	eng	Ziri always gets his way.
10473843	eng	Tom wasn't at that meeting.
10474050	eng	Tom isn't a pilot yet.
10474490	eng	Tom isn't a good planner.
10474814	eng	Tom isn't in his apartment.
10474870	eng	How did you recognise Tom?
10474905	eng	What do you not understand?
10474906	eng	What isn't clear to you?
10475041	eng	Today is the dress rehearsal.
10475086	eng	Something is off about this.
10475099	eng	She's your mom, isn't she?
10475102	eng	It's about five o'clock now.
10475105	eng	Tom's actual name isn't Tom.
10475121	eng	I'll make myself scarce again.
10475134	eng	We're closer to the solution.
10475135	eng	I didn't know the tune.
10475137	eng	All Tom needed was time.
10475141	eng	I'll do you that favour.
10475156	eng	Tom isn't an evil man.
10475168	eng	They've cleared off at last.
10475201	eng	They're trying to kill her.
10475225	eng	He has a private jet.
10475234	eng	I've just started teaching French.
10475311	eng	Did Tom propose to you?
10475315	eng	Tom wiggled like a worm.
10475326	eng	We need to get cracking.
10475333	eng	Did Tom leave the group?
10475370	eng	All of this is mine.
10475375	eng	Do you want another blanket?
10475401	eng	His hair is not black.
10475421	eng	You've been an enormous help.
10475467	eng	Your parents were really worried.
10475469	eng	I really enjoyed your class.
10475616	eng	You were calling my name.
10475623	eng	You were staring at us.
10475633	eng	You were in my room.
10475665	eng	Stay close to your brother.
10475666	eng	You slammed the door open.
10475667	eng	Have you been burning plastic?
10475683	eng	You snuck into my house.
10475688	eng	Stay here with the dog.
10475747	eng	Get rid of this mattress.
10475767	eng	It must be your imagination.
10475793	eng	Are you busy on Thursday?
10475799	eng	Don't reply to the message.
10475874	eng	You look absolutely smoking hot.
10475878	eng	Do you know that fellow?
10475886	eng	You started pushing me backwards.
10475890	eng	Are you from our city?
10475891	eng	Throw Ziri over the railings.
10475896	eng	The windows stood wide open.
10475923	eng	You said that to Ziri.
10475941	eng	Stay away from Ziri's girlfriend.
10475985	eng	The window stands wide open.
10476014	eng	The window was fully open.
10476098	eng	Tom wasn't wearing a watch.
10476264	eng	The problem still remains unsolved.
10476267	eng	Tom isn't going to eat.
10476308	eng	I'm glad that Tom quit.
10476455	eng	I want to call Tom.
10476701	eng	She bought a Spanish-Basque dictionary?
10476807	eng	Please stop using that word.
10476880	eng	Tom isn't a minor anymore.
10477047	eng	Ziri's canines were very decayed.
10477066	eng	Mary's husband is a redhead.
10477170	eng	Ziri sent Rima lewd messages.
10477228	eng	They have a better idea.
10477398	eng	We need to head home.
10477476	eng	Did Tom say what happened?
10477608	eng	Tom isn't coming for sure.
10477815	eng	They took Tom with them.
10477886	eng	She loved Dad very much.
10477915	eng	He loved Mom very much.
10478101	eng	They're heading in my direction.
10478157	eng	There is no plan B.
10478215	eng	Let's go fishing tomorrow morning.
10478287	eng	You look awful. What's wrong?
10478424	eng	We'll finish the game tomorrow.
10478431	eng	Now this is some news.
10478448	eng	It's morning in Japan now.
10478497	eng	Did you hear that, Tom?
10478556	eng	Your television shows sound inorganic.
10478612	eng	Tom needs someone like Mary.
10478656	eng	I don't like my appearance.
10478661	eng	Tom transitioned in high school.
10478669	eng	My cat speaks basic French.
10478690	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't like that.
10478693	eng	Tom isn't interested in this.
10478772	eng	Did Tom give a reason?
10478795	eng	Ziri wanted a Berber-speaking instructor.
10479382	eng	Do not mess with time.
10479414	eng	The matter was decided quickly.
10479462	eng	Ziri has feelings for Rima.
10479567	eng	None of this should matter.
10479578	eng	Well, that's a different matter.
10479616	eng	None of that should matter.
10479644	eng	Maybe we should park here.
10479775	eng	I handed Tom the map.
10479905	eng	Tom's lying. I can tell.
10480266	eng	It really doesn't matter now.
10480362	eng	Mary got on her knees.
10480394	eng	Secretaries don't work on Sundays.
10480396	eng	The windows are wide open.
10480406	eng	Don't touch other people's things!
10480636	eng	I found them playing ball.
10481135	eng	I never asked for anything.
10481347	eng	Are you East Asian too?
10481400	eng	He bought some roasted almonds.
10481409	eng	I'm sorry. Who are you?
10481416	eng	I must be going blind.
10481431	eng	Did he say anything else?
10481502	eng	Can you hear those footsteps?
10481682	eng	I couldn't stay with Tom.
10481701	eng	That distinction may not matter.
10481778	eng	Did you have them understand?
10481923	eng	I lived in that house.
10482232	eng	It doesn't really matter, though.
10482236	eng	Eat if you are hungry.
10482450	eng	Thou art but an Earthling.
10482538	eng	Did you make them understand?
10482683	eng	Don't cooperate with the police.
10482742	eng	Come on, that's ancient history!
10483455	eng	Have you only just noticed?
10483494	eng	The headline is completely dishonest.
10483565	eng	I never learned my history.
10483655	eng	We got that job done.
10483711	eng	Baking bread is an art.
10483867	eng	Trust me if you want.
10483872	eng	We are what we give.
10484405	eng	The Divine Word made light.
10484536	eng	This requires a special skill.
10484727	eng	Kurdistan has a long history.
10484768	eng	The title is completely dishonest.
10484887	eng	Tom isn't from our school.
10485123	eng	It will be done, master.
10485185	eng	Heretics were subjected to torture.
10485190	eng	That was never in doubt.
10485191	eng	That was never in question.
10485322	eng	I gave Tom the map.
10485376	eng	Let's try a little experiment.
10485381	eng	Tom tried the hat on.
10485382	eng	Tom tried on the hat.
10485396	eng	Try it with this sauce.
10485401	eng	Tom tried to call Mary.
10485417	eng	Tom tried to poison us.
10485422	eng	Tom tried to break in.
10485423	eng	I'm ready to try anything.
10485432	eng	Tom needs to try again.
10485441	eng	Mary tried on the dress.
10485442	eng	Mary tried the dress on.
10485449	eng	Tom tried to be strong.
10485461	eng	I didn't do anything different.
10485493	eng	You have a brain disease.
10485495	eng	Usually, Tom doesn't stay long.
10485518	eng	Something sinister is going on.
10485519	eng	There's something sinister going on.
10485521	eng	I wouldn't take it personally.
10485547	eng	Prove you're not a chicken.
10485744	eng	They know nothing about Istanbul.
10486253	eng	I'm gonna make you cry!
10486354	eng	I ain't that soft, y'know!
10486439	eng	Why are you blocking me?
10486478	eng	I told you, go home!
10486487	eng	I told you to wait!
10486530	eng	Ziri didn't bring his card.
10486743	eng	Israel's namesake was born Jacob.
10487778	eng	You should sometimes praise Tom.
10488659	eng	It is better with butter.
10488806	eng	I may well be wrong.
10488807	eng	I might well be wrong.
10488872	eng	They will certainly kill us.
10488970	eng	Game, set, and match, Federer.
10489048	eng	They won't surely like it.
10489214	eng	I'll try to be fair.
10489230	eng	I'll try to stall them.
10489340	eng	What is Tom eating? Soup?
10489532	eng	Tom wanted to feel included.
10489593	eng	Tom isn't ready for us.
10489601	eng	I'm going to ask it.
10489850	eng	My schoolbag is very heavy.
10489859	eng	There will be no merger.
10489861	eng	No merger will take place.
10489877	eng	Go over the list again.
10490028	eng	Tom and I'll stay together.
10490202	eng	When did you get angry?
10490204	eng	Why did you get angry?
10490831	eng	So, you like him too.
10490833	eng	Damn, this beat goes hard.
10490874	eng	The dub was really bad.
10490916	eng	It was a stunning landscape.
10490927	eng	The day came and went.
10490928	eng	I'm awake, as it happens.
10490930	eng	I am in fact awake.
10490952	eng	Doesn't his answer surprise you?
10490956	eng	That's not what we agreed.
10490972	eng	It's snowing on the roads.
10490978	eng	I don't distribute your products.
10491009	eng	I read a Spanish book.
10491012	eng	My sister really loves boys.
10491020	eng	Please fax it to me.
10491038	eng	There's something in the air.
10491040	eng	Look me in the eye.
10491046	eng	Do you need a briefing?
10491220	eng	Hand me the magnifying glass.
10491238	eng	I don't smoke at all.
10491309	eng	It's a matter of teamwork.
10491427	eng	Today is merely rehearsal anyway.
10491575	eng	Tom hated living in Boston.
10492339	eng	Switch off the telephone, Sasha!
10492410	eng	My apartment key isn’t working.
10492739	eng	Switch off the phone, Sasha!
10492781	eng	He is feeling blue today.
10492902	eng	I came to like Tom.
10492913	eng	It's like a hospital here.
10492928	eng	Tom applied for a grant.
10492983	eng	What are your real intentions?
10492986	eng	What's the F9 button for?
10492997	eng	You should be an artist.
10493008	eng	My teacher is really beautiful.
10493020	eng	Are you scared about something?
10493024	eng	I will pay you back.
10493055	eng	Woods green up in spring.
10493074	eng	Judaism and Samaritanism are ethnoreligions.
10493255	eng	Now I'll try something else.
10493256	eng	I sort of like Tom.
10493405	eng	Some religions believe in xenoglossia.
10493423	eng	I am new around here.
10493468	eng	Other opinions don't really matter.
10493505	eng	That rumor can't be true.
10493508	eng	Words can't describe the beauty.
10493510	eng	French can't be mastered overnight.
10493582	eng	All Tom needs is time.
10493589	eng	What's Tom in prison for?
10493597	eng	Tom tried to resist arrest.
10493654	eng	Do you like apple butter?
10493683	eng	I told you to wait.
10493751	eng	I learned this from Tom.
10493820	eng	Tom tried not to snicker.
10493914	eng	Roadblocks have been set up.
10493917	eng	I think highly of Tom.
10494011	eng	I made up with Tom.
10494015	eng	Tom couldn't control his children.
10494445	eng	We need to stay healthy.
10494551	eng	Tom delivered it to us.
10494599	eng	I got to know Tom.
10494613	eng	I wish I'd met Tom.
10494711	eng	This evening's moon is fantastic.

10585160	eng	Invite her to the theatre.
10585162	eng	I'm nicely combed and shaved.

10586410	eng	Tom is walking the dog.
10586518	eng	Put this under your seat.
10586585	eng	I realize I should've called.
10586607	eng	It has a long tail.
10586608	eng	He has a big dick.
10586623	eng	We expect that to continue.
10586628	eng	I'll check on that later.

10586863	eng	This is very important now.
10586870	eng	I have learnt it now.

10587520	eng	Thanks for lending me money.
10587538	eng	I can't hear Tom anymore.
10587539	eng	Do these pieces fit together?
10587666	eng	Her breath tickled my hair.
10587813	eng	Did you like the quiche?
10587868	eng	Why should Ziri help Rima?
10587874	eng	Ziri was out of options.
10587960	eng	Tom sent us a parcel.
10588336	eng	We are at work again.
10588362	eng	Do you speak Hungarian well?
10588400	eng	Did they speak Hungarian well?
10588509	eng	We've finally reached a compromise.
10588625	eng	Tortoises can be great pets.

10589193	eng	What is your surname, please?
10589230	eng	I stepped into the conversation.
10589233	eng	It looks fantastic on you.
10589235	eng	I think it's quite good.
10589236	eng	I reckon it's quite good.
10589255	eng	I didn't receive your message.
10589270	eng	Tom thought it was weird.
10589284	eng	The trip wore him out.
10589310	eng	Where does this door lead?
10589319	eng	He rang the doorbell twice.
10589352	eng	Someone said you'd got ill.
10589354	eng	Someone said you'd fallen ill.
10589359	eng	Tom has run a bath.
10589401	eng	We've arrived at the station.
10589498	eng	My brother remained a bachelor.
10589562	eng	I didn't get your message.
10589590	eng	Why are tardigrades so cute?
10589591	eng	Why are puppies so cute?

10589660	eng	The building turned to ashes.
10589661	eng	The building turned into ashes.

10589965	eng	This room needs aired out.
10589979	eng	Get off your high horse.
10590004	eng	I feel comfortable with him.
10590152	eng	Just keep that in mind.
10590265	eng	Tom's screaming woke Mary up.
10590337	eng	Tom bought a new shirt.
10590472	eng	I ordered a banana split.
10590518	eng	He's been blind since birth.
10590531	eng	It's an extremely large subject.
10590539	eng	I started writing in Tamazight.
10590543	eng	Tom refuses to eat spinach.

10590661	eng	She should talk to Tom.
10590662	eng	He should talk to Tom.
10591508	eng	Did you get them back?

10592863	eng	Tom got Mary a beer.
10592867	eng	Tom got Mary a refund.
10592868	eng	Tom got Mary a blanket.
10592977	eng	Tom didn't offer an explanation.

10592995	eng	We couldn't get any closer.
10593000	eng	She's after a better job.
10593002	eng	He's an expert in astronomy.
10593005	eng	He's apt to be late.
10593031	eng	Of course, Tom denied that.
10593032	eng	Tom denied that, of course.
10593033	eng	Of course, Tom denied everything.
10593034	eng	Tom denied everything, of course.
10593035	eng	Tom denied the accusations immediately.
10593044	eng	The answer is absolutely not.
10593045	eng	Tom got addicted to painkillers.
10593051	eng	You're awake, you're not asleep.
10593052	eng	You're awake, you're not sleeping.
10593053	eng	We hope you'll be here.
10593054	eng	If only you were here.
10593057	eng	We refuse to believe him.
10593059	eng	I had a terrible day.
10593061	eng	Does it gross you out?
10593063	eng	My neighbor is very pretty.
10593064	eng	I got sick of you.
10593066	eng	He painted them for me.
10593068	eng	My neighbor is a cutie.
10593141	eng	People sometimes ask interesting questions.
10593157	eng	This is a lethal trap.
10593160	eng	Ziri bought a mouse trap.
10593179	eng	He often brings his umbrella.
10593279	eng	Tom has his own place.
10593371	eng	When's your next doctor's appointment?
10593374	eng	Let me gather my thoughts.
10593381	eng	I want to understand humans.
10593389	eng	It's time to stop procrastinating.

10593461	eng	He lives off his debts.
10593462	eng	She's out of her coma.
10593468	eng	Her eyes sparkled with joy.
10593616	eng	Tom said he liked me.
10593934	eng	Tom puts ketchup on everything.
10593979	eng	You need to stop complaining.
10594088	eng	Tom said hello to me.
10594096	eng	What's the key to happiness?
10594139	eng	We hid on the island.
10594182	eng	They hid behind the house.
10594312	eng	Tomorrow I will eat fruits.
10594814	eng	A new spider moved in.
10595052	eng	Fortunately, we returned home unharmed.
10595556	eng	Let me answer that question.
10595601	eng	Tom said he loved it.
10595895	eng	My daughters will help you.
10595919	eng	We're not open on Sunday.
10596148	eng	The new plan worked outstandingly.
10596149	eng	I'm starting to love myself.
10596268	eng	Isn't that what people want?
10596301	eng	The new plan worked great.
10596373	eng	He tends to be late.
10596398	eng	I don't worry about money.
10596498	eng	We aren't open on Sundays.

10596515	eng	Our cat ate our hamster.
10596520	eng	Tom stayed here last night.
10596546	eng	I'm honoured to be here.
10596562	eng	I was cleaning the bath.
10596567	eng	He's nothing but a fool.
10596594	eng	Mary was about to faint.
10596609	eng	He's such a lazy fellow.
10596644	eng	Can I pet your cat?
10596716	eng	What's happening here this afternoon?
10596720	eng	Tom has been bad-mouthing Mary.
10596723	eng	That's something to worry about.

10596751	eng	She's very fond of flowers.
10596760	eng	Tom got Mary some wine.
10596777	eng	Tom can't see Mary today.
10596784	eng	Tom got Mary a raise.
10596816	eng	I'll do this again tomorrow.
10596817	eng	I did this yesterday, too.
10596822	eng	Tom was biting his nails.
10596843	eng	What's in the top drawer?
10596856	eng	It's time we said goodbye.
10596863	eng	Who gave you this money?
10596865	eng	People here don't like Tom.
10596871	eng	Tom is eager to help.
10596894	eng	They amputated Tom's right leg.
10596906	eng	Tom said he was next.
10596914	eng	She's engaged in social work.
10596917	eng	He's as talkative as ever.
10596919	eng	She's anxious to go abroad.
10596923	eng	It's been a real challenge.
10596924	eng	I regret not helping Tom.
10596939	eng	How old are your sons?
10596942	eng	Tom is still Mary's husband.
10596967	eng	He's good at riding horses.
10596969	eng	You'll have to wait outside.

10597179	eng	My suitcase is very light.
10597180	eng	Tom doesn't know Mary's family.
10597190	eng	Tom gave me this painting.
10597193	eng	Tom doesn't show his feelings.

10627363	eng	Why is life like that?
10627365	eng	Why is she ignoring me?
10627370	eng	I hope you're happy now.
10627384	eng	It looks like a fox.
10627387	eng	Tom bent over in pain.
10627403	eng	When did she come back?
10627460	eng	Go ahead and do that.

10627630	eng	Ziri pulled Rima's mask off.
10627639	eng	Ziri didn't steal Rima's phone.
10627644	eng	Ziri is still a freak.
10627651	eng	Rima is our prom queen.
10627662	eng	Ziri's skin looks totally fine.
10627664	eng	Ziri hugged Rima tight again.

10668439	eng	I want you inside me.
10668459	eng	The universe is a hologram.
10668466	eng	I'm asking if you're hungry.

10764189	eng	Shall I leave you half?
10764197	eng	Neither of them are here.
10764242	eng	Please don′t make me go.

10899155	eng	The tension is getting unbearable.
10899646	eng	I drank a little yesterday.
10899648	eng	I avoid talking to her.
10899653	eng	We said goodbye to her.
10899671	eng	She said the same thing.
10899682	eng	She wears her hair up.
10899686	eng	She wears her hair down.
10899756	eng	Bread was all I ate.
10899764	eng	We all went home together.
10899816	eng	A lot of people died.
10899909	eng	Why is pinball so addictive?
10899917	eng	Did you see any ghosts?
10899954	eng	You were destroying my life.
10899975	eng	You have exactly one minute.
10899979	eng	You certainly delivered the goods.
10900000	eng	Your privacy is very important.
10900041	eng	Why has this problem arisen?
10900044	eng	Why did you tell me?
10900055	eng	What was on the paper?
10900061	eng	What shall we do now?
10900104	eng	I learned nowt at school.
10900112	eng	What do you suggest, then?
10900114	eng	What do you advise, sir?
10900122	eng	What color is your parachute?
10900131	eng	What a tragedy misunderstandings are.
10900134	eng	Mrs Sato rang at eleven.
10900137	eng	Mrs Sato phoned at eleven.
10900183	eng	Who reads the newspaper anymore?
10900197	eng	Who heads up this organization?
10900204	eng	Who am I to argue?
10900235	eng	He's too timid to try.
10900236	eng	He's too scared to try.
10900260	eng	How does my voice sound?
10900310	eng	You should consult a dentist.
10900311	eng	You should see a dentist.
10900331	eng	This has never been explained.
10900342	eng	Have you ever thought that?
10900347	eng	Ziri and Rima's argument escalated.
10900350	eng	Ziri was having a nightmare.
10900367	eng	Will you turn it off?
10900369	eng	Will you let me finish?
10900370	eng	Will you go with me?
10900375	eng	Are you selling those paintings?
10900385	eng	This shop sells old books.
10900387	eng	Was it a good idea?
10900396	eng	It's a very time-consuming task.
10900402	eng	Summer is cold this year.
10900403	eng	Please drive on the left.
10900408	eng	"Good morning," said Tom, smiling.
10900417	eng	This is public domain content.
10900434	eng	Spain has cities in Morocco.
10900444	eng	This is a major setback.
10900445	eng	This is a binding contract.
10900506	eng	I am Ziri from Algiers.
10900513	eng	I'm not arrogant. I'm right.
10900517	eng	Things got a little crazy.
10900518	eng	Things started to get crazy.
10900524	eng	Things are really getting crazy.
10900526	eng	Ziri found that really crazy.
10900596	eng	Rima, too, deserves pretty things.
10900597	eng	We are shifting to Algiers.
10900600	eng	Ziri was covered in spaghetti.
10900607	eng	"It's a genuine Gucci." "Please!"
10900624	eng	Rima designed brilliant Kabyle dresses.
10900631	eng	Ziri's dad spoils him rotten.
10900636	eng	Ziri stared at his parents.
10900664	eng	You are a life saver.
10900698	eng	Have you washed the sink?
10900711	eng	You're really good with babies.
10900725	eng	The house was pitch dark.
10900989	eng	Stop apologizing all the time!
10901050	eng	We hardly knew each other.
10901053	eng	We barely knew each other.
10901063	eng	Teachers don't make much money.
10901067	eng	Is the TV bothering you?
10901526	eng	It's become a bit cloudy.
10901620	eng	Open that window over there.
10901631	eng	Watch out for foul balls.
10901749	eng	It's an old Japanese movie.
10901751	eng	Summers are hot in Japan.
10901756	eng	Those people are my friends.
10901774	eng	That dog has big ears.
10901782	eng	The weather's not good today.
10901792	eng	This is a bicycle magazine.
10901794	eng	This is a car magazine.
10901799	eng	My pen is this one.
10901801	eng	My father is a banker.
10901810	eng	My mother really likes cake.
10901842	eng	It's cheap but very nutritious.
10901843	eng	It's inexpensive but very nutritious.
10901850	eng	Cars are expensive but useful.
10901868	eng	This curry is very hot.
10901875	eng	You can't enter this room.
10901878	eng	This is my house key.
10901896	eng	Our dog is really cute.
10901907	eng	This dictionary isn't very good.
10901914	eng	That teacher's classes are interesting.
10901915	eng	That teacher's class is interesting.
10901933	eng	That big briefcase is mine.
10901947	eng	We offer flexible repayment options.
10901974	eng	We are a homogeneous community.
10902027	eng	Let's buy something to eat.
10902028	eng	Let's buy something to drink.
10902032	eng	Come and sit with me.
10902043	eng	Japan is a small country.
10903372	eng	Why is Tom always hungry?
10903378	eng	This pear isn't ripe yet.
10903390	eng	Will there be anyone else?
10903463	eng	Tom is a chronic liar.
10903469	eng	Fish feed on mosquito larvae.
10903603	eng	Martial law has been declared.
10903606	eng	What's your stance on this?
10903619	eng	Will you be staying long?
10903622	eng	He's a very honest lad.
10903623	eng	The issue sparked public debate.
10903628	eng	The restaurant is always full.
10903631	eng	How long were you ill?
10903653	eng	Let's listen to the cassette.
10903655	eng	All but one was there.
10903656	eng	All but one were there.
10903657	eng	The film starts at ten.
10903660	eng	Eventually, he noticed his mistake.
10903666	eng	Let's go to the seaside.
10903669	eng	Look at the following example.
10903670	eng	Look at the following examples.
10903674	eng	I get up at 7:30.
10903686	eng	I know a good restaurant.
10903687	eng	I know a good store.
10903724	eng	I teach Japanese to foreigners.
10903731	eng	I don't really like studying.
10903741	eng	I didn't remember that person.
10903755	eng	I want to go on.
10903757	eng	Can you beat my score?
10903773	eng	A band is a band.
10903775	eng	It was an old car.
10904608	eng	Can you tow my car?
10904682	eng	Get out of my store.
10904788	eng	Can I help you pack?
10904826	eng	I love the new logo.
10904828	eng	Get down and dig in.
10904832	eng	Give a man a chance.
10904834	eng	It must not be lost.
10904840	eng	That is not my forte.
10904841	eng	I like leaning on it.
10904844	eng	That was an hour ago.
10904851	eng	It was a large canoe.
10904852	eng	Do you have a spouse?
10904871	eng	Tell them all to wait.
10904882	eng	That was a rough ride.
10904884	eng	It was a gaping wound.
10904891	eng	I returned to my work.
10904892	eng	Oh, it's you, is it?
10904900	eng	Is that crazy or what?
10904905	eng	That may very well be.
10904910	eng	It appears to be true.
10904911	eng	I worked hard on that.
10904914	eng	It became a local hit.
10904915	eng	It was worth the risk.
10904916	eng	It was an instant hit.
10904921	eng	Here's a joke I like.
10904923	eng	The bus was late today.
10904926	eng	The boy shook his head.
10904927	eng	Well, what do you want?
10904929	eng	I can help protect you.
10904930	eng	Call me in the evening.
10904933	eng	Lets just get the shot.
10904934	eng	Can I borrow your bike?
10904937	eng	The whole thing is off.
10904938	eng	Hold the line a minute.
10904939	eng	Why can't you get it?
10904940	eng	Do you value your hide?
10904944	eng	Few people own a horse.
10904948	eng	The dead have no friends.
10904949	eng	My lawn mower is broken.
10904950	eng	I'll give you a break.
10904952	eng	One must prepare for it.
10904955	eng	Only the good die young.
10904959	eng	That was my only chance.
10904962	eng	I must have been asleep.
10904963	eng	So, what do you propose?
10904964	eng	I love rhythm and blues.
10904967	eng	It was a superb picture.
10904970	eng	Well, it's a good gag.
10904971	eng	I beat the world record.
10904974	eng	No plans have been made.
10904975	eng	Nobody would take it on.
10905050	eng	You're suspended for a month.
10905051	eng	Ziri showed off his abs.
10905101	eng	Ziri's moves were always sudden.
10905108	eng	Ziri's best friend was Walid.
10905150	eng	Rima's baby has never died.
10905300	eng	Ziri doesn't know this school.
10905303	eng	Ziri looked at the screen.
10905304	eng	Ziri lost track of time.
10905320	eng	Ziri has finally woken up.
10905326	eng	Ziri didn't expect any less.
10905350	eng	That's the reaction I want.
10905383	eng	Small animals are very cute.
10905393	eng	Ziri is receiving visitors today.
10905401	eng	Ziri dropped to the floor.
10905408	eng	This sent Ziri into tears.
10905411	eng	Ziri was crying over Rima.
10905426	eng	Ziri blew up his candle.
10905427	eng	The flashlight lit everything up.
10905428	eng	Ziri pulled out a gun.
10905429	eng	Ziri rushed Rima back inside.
10905444	eng	Ziri walked into Rima's apartment.
10905464	eng	Ziri likes to play victim.
10905855	eng	Tom loves both of them.
10905857	eng	They speak Kurdish in Kurdistan.
10905871	eng	I get sick a lot.
10905934	eng	Sami was able to cope.
10906019	eng	Geocaching is a new sport.
10906021	eng	The slaves suffered cruel oppression.
10906122	eng	Typically, the toilet is white.
10906255	eng	I started drinking with haste.
10906491	eng	The apple is still green.
10906527	eng	The apple isn't ripe yet.
10906543	eng	Apples are rich in vitamins.
10906566	eng	I have a hundred apples.
10906567	eng	The apple was half rotten.
10906569	eng	These apples are very large.
10906572	eng	I ate a couple apples.
10906577	eng	The cavalry endured an attack.
10906579	eng	Those apples are really big.
10906590	eng	Here's the apple I found.
10906593	eng	We bought five red apples.
10906594	eng	He ate bananas and apples.
10906665	eng	Ours is better than yours.
10906702	eng	Tell me where it's located.
10906710	eng	I was surprised as well.
10906713	eng	I left my past behind.
10906827	eng	I made the same mistake.
10906830	eng	I've got a good lawyer.
10906832	eng	This peach tart is tasty.
10906834	eng	One can't be too careful.
10906838	eng	The woman shook her head.
10906839	eng	It's a brave new world.
10906841	eng	There are no tricks here.
10906843	eng	How did the operation go?
10906844	eng	It's still a bit early.
10907909	eng	I can recommend the soup.
10907910	eng	Can we arrange a meeting?
10907916	eng	The deadline was not met.
10907917	eng	That's when I tried it.
10907919	eng	I'll bet it's a summons.
10907922	eng	The cup handle has broken.
10907923	eng	They'd never let you go.
10907924	eng	There was a short silence.
10907942	eng	Yes, that would do nicely.
10908013	eng	Which version do you have?
10908020	eng	I can't wait for summer!
10908021	eng	There was a longish pause.
10908025	eng	Fishing for bass is tough.
10908027	eng	Well, what's to be done?
10908101	eng	Ziri cut open the sheep.
10908115	eng	Ziri went inside the room.
10908120	eng	Ziri created an online store.
10908123	eng	Ziri was nothing like Rima.
10908134	eng	The big boulder is gone.
10908135	eng	I've never seen it done.
10908141	eng	This deadline was not met.
10908143	eng	The origins are not known.
10908146	eng	The alliance was a secret.
10908147	eng	The seeds are also edible.
10908153	eng	Tigers and lions are scary.
10908154	eng	I'll talk to you tonight.
10908165	eng	Ziri ended up falling asleep.
10908167	eng	Ziri put on Walid's costume.
10908170	eng	Ziri was just fooling around.
10908179	eng	Ziri watched Rima walk away.
10908181	eng	Ziri thought about Rima often.
10908190	eng	Ziri walked into the cafeteria.
10908213	eng	Ziri's face literally screamed danger.
10908218	eng	You don't know my type.
10908233	eng	Ziri was being escorted out.
10908281	eng	Tom wasn't wearing a cap.
10908287	eng	I don't know Tom's whereabouts.
10908676	eng	Tom printed out the letter.
10908678	eng	Tom printed the letter out.
10908679	eng	This woman has black hair.
10908688	eng	I wonder what he meant.
10908710	eng	Everyone laughed at Tom's jokes.
10908787	eng	You're not a bad learner.
10908788	eng	You're not a good learner.
10908796	eng	Yeah, I'm talking to you.
10908797	eng	Don't argue with me here.
10908803	eng	I'll have a taco, please.
10908804	eng	I watched the concert live.
10908811	eng	I could readily believe it.
10908816	eng	Now, where are my eyedrops?
10908818	eng	The news was well received.
10908823	eng	The delay won't hurt now.
10908828	eng	The gentleman took my card.
10908831	eng	The war, however, was lost.
10908835	eng	The old motto was retained.
10908837	eng	I was thinking of tomorrow.
10908839	eng	The drawer was stuck closed.
10908841	eng	The rules should be changed.
10908844	eng	The check will be certified.
10908851	eng	Don't forget to add basil.
10908856	eng	I always drink orange juice.
10908858	eng	The show was broadcast live.
10908860	eng	My record speaks for itself.
10908861	eng	Please don't say any more.
10908865	eng	I was accepted into Harvard.
10908867	eng	Who won last night's game?
10908873	eng	The following is an example.
10908880	eng	They'll be here any minute.
10908891	eng	We'll have to satisfy them.
10908893	eng	Hmm, that does seem difficult.
10908895	eng	Chess is an amusing activity.
10908896	eng	It's either all or nothing.
10908898	eng	Nobody can serve two masters.
10908899	eng	Grab your rucksack and hurry!
10908903	eng	The tiny lamb bleated softly.
10908904	eng	We can't undo our mistakes.
10908909	eng	Tuna tastes great with bread.
10908913	eng	You're beating a dead horse.
10908915	eng	Well, after that it's easy.
10908927	eng	"It's all right," I said.
10908928	eng	It was a curious coincidence.
10908930	eng	It was a gigantic inadequacy.
10908931	eng	We didn't get the necklace.
10908933	eng	Together they ate the rabbit.
10908936	eng	All members go by pseudonyms.
10908965	eng	That large bag is mine.
10909029	eng	I also want to know.
10909034	eng	Apricots are my favorite fruit.
10910059	eng	Membership is free of charge.
10910064	eng	The couple have one daughter.
10910174	eng	She looked at the ceiling.
10910198	eng	Who's that playing the piano?
10910217	eng	The train picked up speed.
10910220	eng	Today is warmer than yesterday.
10910249	eng	She dropped out of university.
10910255	eng	The weather today is rainy.
10910256	eng	Come back home before six.
10910312	eng	Is the museum open daily?
10910325	eng	They'd like to pay cash.
10910333	eng	You can pay by cash.
10910334	eng	I'm going to take attendance.
10910337	eng	The initial enthusiasm has abated.
10910338	eng	The initial enthusiasm has waned.
10910345	eng	The children learned how knit.
10910353	eng	I'm not worrying about them.
10910358	eng	The world premiere is tonight.
10910359	eng	All the juniors were summoned.
10910360	eng	The championship will be ours.
10910376	eng	The dress was outrageously expensive.
10910384	eng	Do you worry about pesticides?
10910392	eng	I should have noticed that.
10910396	eng	The buyers showed no interest.
10910417	eng	He insisted that we go.
10910470	eng	Rima wiped off her makeup.
10910472	eng	Ziri showed up with shorts.
10910477	eng	Ziri turned around in shock.
10910483	eng	Can I take Berber classes?
10910562	eng	We could go there together.
10910577	eng	Just stay away from Rima.
10910586	eng	Ziri came into his room.
10910612	eng	The siege lasted until August.
10910613	eng	The town has three cemeteries.
10910614	eng	Painting is your real calling.
10910616	eng	Ziri started picking them up.
10910618	eng	Everything was safe and quiet.
10910635	eng	Wisdom is better than strength.
10910639	eng	Ziri reached for his inhaler.
10910641	eng	Ziri continued calming Rima down.
10910647	eng	Ziri needs to come closer.
10910661	eng	Tom hardly ever uses them.
10910662	eng	Today is my wife's birthday.
10910670	eng	It caused only minor damage.
10911346	eng	The rebel leader was executed.
10911365	eng	The proportions were all wrong.
10911369	eng	Every folder contained a photo.
10911370	eng	You're still a good reporter.
10911378	eng	A firmware update is available.
10911380	eng	That wasn't at all necessary.
10911384	eng	Hang tinsel from both branches.
10911391	eng	There's simply nothing to it.
10911392	eng	Don't eat any dinner tonight.
10911397	eng	Climate change is real, people.
10911400	eng	A tiny gnome suddenly appeared.
10911401	eng	This dogma has been challenged.
10911403	eng	Three fast boats were deployed.
10911411	eng	That marriage ended in divorce.
10911412	eng	Nobody ever changes around here.
10911419	eng	You'd better get your friends.
10911427	eng	I don't need a bag.
10911428	eng	I don't want a bag.
10911436	eng	I'll be absent from school.
10911451	eng	Unfortunately, I can't do that.
10911463	eng	Class is about to start.
10911464	eng	Class is about to begin.
10911474	eng	I'll have an Espresso, please.
10911480	eng	My grandfather was a pharmacist.
10912635	eng	This area is under construction.
10912646	eng	America abolished slavery in 1863.
10912694	eng	When I'm sleepy, I sleep.
10912779	eng	But I was too late.
10912783	eng	The journey is the destination.
10912784	eng	The way is the goal.
10912785	eng	But who is the enemy?
10912805	eng	But what can be done?
10912812	eng	It's in a rural area.
10912839	eng	The mascot is an eagle.
10912845	eng	No police officers were wounded.
10912876	eng	Ziri dropped Rima back home.
10912890	eng	I'm so disappointed in you.
10912897	eng	Suddenly, Ziri burst out laughing.
10912963	eng	Ziri worked his butt off.
10912965	eng	You mean there's someone else?
10912972	eng	Tom was given a present.
10912983	eng	It has a metallic luster.
10912984	eng	We've always had the best.
10912985	eng	It is no longer locatable.
10913010	eng	Ziri sat on a bench.
10913011	eng	The cars were all repainted.
10913012	eng	Hurry up with those things.
10913017	eng	How long is summer vacation?
10913021	eng	What will happen without me?
10913035	eng	Ziri went back to school.
10913038	eng	Get off me, you sicko!
10913041	eng	Ziri took off his wig.
10913058	eng	Ziri ended up in detention.
10913064	eng	Ziri just pushed Rima back.
10913070	eng	Rima cried her heart out.
10913089	eng	Just then, Ziri popped up.
10913104	eng	You're at every football game.
10913108	eng	However, they soon parted ways.
10913109	eng	The airline is privately owned.
10913112	eng	Allegedly, the note was burned.
10913114	eng	Tom likes tea, doesn't he?
10913118	eng	It's been very, very enjoyable.
10913120	eng	Many officials starved to death.
10913122	eng	The wood is considered odorless.
10913132	eng	I really love half-price sales.
10913134	eng	No, you can't do that.
10913139	eng	French seems boring to me.
10913249	eng	All the past was better.
10913299	eng	Can you cut my hair?
10913387	eng	I'm not going shopping today.
10913458	eng	Neither of the amendments passed.
10913459	eng	The expression made little sense.
10913460	eng	This project is currently shelved.
10913464	eng	No passenger service is available.
10913484	eng	It's never been formally documented.
10913522	eng	These reports are apparently incorrect.
10913714	eng	I get how you feel.
10914882	eng	How do you use these?
10914885	eng	I testified in the afternoon.
10914908	eng	I wasn't afraid of anything.
10914909	eng	I wasn't scared of anything.
10914922	eng	Who called the fire department?
10915065	eng	Ziri brought the books back.
10915073	eng	Ziri walked into Berber class.
10915100	eng	Ziri ended up fighting Walid.
10915118	eng	All of you, get out.
10915168	eng	With this, Ziri walked away.
10915175	eng	Ziri's face suddenly lit up.
10915190	eng	Ziri pushed the bully away.
10915193	eng	Hearing that, Ziri stormed off.
10915206	eng	Ziri jumped on Rima furiously.
10915211	eng	Ziri is out of control.
10915266	eng	Ziri sat across Rima, grinning.
10915267	eng	Why don't you look up?
10915301	eng	With that, Ziri walked out.
10915331	eng	Get off of my husband.
10915332	eng	Get off of my man.
10915364	eng	Ziri turned the radio up.
10915542	eng	But there's nothing else here.
10915548	eng	Security forces were called out.
10915588	eng	This is the simplest way.
10915596	eng	We're glad Tom isn't here.
10915732	eng	Why did they kidnap Tom?
10915810	eng	It can be eaten raw.
10915811	eng	You can eat it raw.
10916736	eng	Momoztli likes eating cactus fruits.
10916857	eng	Nobody gave it to him.
10917068	eng	The brewery produces three beers.
10917070	eng	The stone fortress was destroyed.
10917071	eng	This restaurant has since closed.
10917084	eng	Who should I speak to?
10917182	eng	Which shoes will you buy?
10917205	eng	Who will you meet tomorrow?
10917208	eng	Who are you meeting tomorrow?
10917209	eng	Who are you seeing tomorrow?
10917210	eng	Who will you see tomorrow?
10917249	eng	My favorite drink is tea.
10917254	eng	My favorite beverage is tea.
10918322	eng	If it's close by, walk.
10918325	eng	If it's close, let's walk.
10918326	eng	If it's near, let's walk.
10918369	eng	The plane is flying south.
10918432	eng	How was the movie yesterday?
10918490	eng	It could've been even worse.
10918502	eng	What are your favorite things?
10918540	eng	We've done six kilometres today.
10918541	eng	We've covered six kilometres today.
10918681	eng	Rima looked like a doll.
10918688	eng	Ziri lived near an airport.
10918700	eng	Ziri had a total breakdown.
10918701	eng	Ziri slept the whole day.
10918702	eng	Ziri was the perfect husband.
10918705	eng	Ziri fell off the bed.
10918713	eng	Ziri's world crumbled to pieces.
10918715	eng	Ziri left Rima with nothing.
10918721	eng	Ziri almost gave up hope.
10918739	eng	Ziri can always move away.
10918742	eng	Ziri landed at the airport.
10918747	eng	Ew!!! Did you just fart?
10918750	eng	Ziri was dressing Rima's wounds.
10918754	eng	Ziri gave his parakeet away.
10918759	eng	Ziri bonded with his stepmother.
10918760	eng	Ziri introduced Rima to everyone.
10918770	eng	Ziri is crying about Rima.
10918771	eng	Ziri stood on a table.
10918782	eng	The cops took Ziri away.
10918786	eng	Ziri put on his pants.
10918794	eng	Let's catch up at lunch.
10918799	eng	Ziri spat in Rima's face.
10918806	eng	Ziri started yelling out loud.
10918808	eng	Ziri's parents didn't show up.
10918820	eng	Ziri tried pulling Rima away.
10918846	eng	Ziri went back to class.
10918868	eng	Ziri stayed back in class.
10918872	eng	No one backed Ziri up.
10918874	eng	Ziri walked into the restroom.
10918886	eng	You're on private property here.
10918905	eng	What Tom wrote is illegible.
10918919	eng	I couldn't ascertain the reason.
10918952	eng	I'll go over tomorrow afternoon.
10919087	eng	I eat cereal for breakfast.
10919234	eng	Please bring me a drink.
10919287	eng	These batteries can be recharged.
10919292	eng	No more beer for Tom.
10919300	eng	I changed the keyboard's battery.
10919624	eng	They ran to the scene.
10919636	eng	The police officer was attacked.
10919637	eng	Someone attacked the police officer.
10919653	eng	Tom wishes to be alone.
10919654	eng	Tom wished to be alone.
10919675	eng	Let's throw Tom a party.
10919676	eng	They threw rocks at us.
10919694	eng	What you're doing is irritating.
10919705	eng	That's getting on my nerves.
10919752	eng	Tom has many French-speaking friends.
10920769	eng	Tom gathered evidence against them.
10921363	eng	This child has a cat.
10921618	eng	Tom needs to practice driving.
10921665	eng	The boy lost the slipper.
10921785	eng	Nice to have you back.
10921789	eng	Orange is Tom's favourite colour.
10921791	eng	Can you lot smell something?
10921797	eng	Is that not his hat?
10921806	eng	Have you got health insurance?
10921809	eng	The fracture must be X-rayed.
10921812	eng	The nurse dresses the wound.
10921813	eng	He has dislocated his shoulder.
10921814	eng	Can you act as interpreter?
10921821	eng	They had a church wedding.
10921825	eng	He ignored all the warnings.
10921839	eng	Who is the letter from?
10921874	eng	Tom has an impeccable alibi.
10922968	eng	How deep are the oceans?
10923027	eng	We hadn't, ourselves, considered that.
10923064	eng	You have to believe Tom.
10923255	eng	It'll be something you'll enjoy.
10923259	eng	I'm sure you'll enjoy it.
10923262	eng	Tom has seen the list.
10923267	eng	We have no more blackberries.
10923274	eng	Tom got his job back.
10923280	eng	Give us time to prepare.
10923300	eng	The bouncer threw Ziri out.
10923303	eng	Seeing that, Ziri stormed out.
10923318	eng	Ziri ended up scolding Rima.
10923326	eng	Ziri ended up in tears.
10923376	eng	I asked just in case.
10923392	eng	I wish it got colder.
10923447	eng	Ziri suddenly burped out loud.
10923454	eng	Ziri was falling for Rima.
10923535	eng	Ziri was on a mission.
10923559	eng	What is going on today?
10923851	eng	Your lithium levels were low.
10924173	eng	Tom ordered a pepperoni pizza.
10924199	eng	He swims like an anvil.
10925574	eng	What's so depressing about that?
10925577	eng	Neuralgia is a rare disease.
10925580	eng	It is currently being redesigned.
10925583	eng	Both drugstores had soda fountains.
10925623	eng	Will this affect Algeria's economy?
10925627	eng	Morocco increased its public spending.
10925636	eng	Algeria's economy is currently recovering.
10925638	eng	Morocco's economy is very fragile.
10925639	eng	Algeria's unemployment rate is declining.
10925645	eng	Is Algeria facing high inflation?
10925663	eng	Algeria's economy isn't exactly stagnant.
10925740	eng	A lot of soldiers arrived.
10925766	eng	The Merkava crushed the car.
10925904	eng	She's not a prodigy whatsoever.
10925906	eng	Is this even a name?
10925910	eng	That's not nice at all.
10925952	eng	Do you even have sex?
10926383	eng	Tom has an excellent memory.
10926406	eng	We'll get through it together.
10926479	eng	Grandma's stew is really exceptional!
10926480	eng	Tom was traveling by bus.
10926482	eng	Grannie's stew is something else.
10926541	eng	I'll give it my best.
10926777	eng	Let's pretend everything is prepped.
10926893	eng	Let's forget this ever happened.
10927767	eng	It was an oblong shape.
10927768	eng	Important information might be missing.
10927772	eng	Excuse me. Where's the library?
10927774	eng	The Taliban are ruling Afghanistan.
10927787	eng	Algeria suspended trade with Spain.
10927795	eng	Algeria severed ties with Morocco.
10927853	eng	It's almost time to sleep.
10927877	eng	Tom is such a himbo.
10927906	eng	The bathroom tiles are white.
10927967	eng	I wish we could teleport.
10928110	eng	Tom has been learning French.
10928172	eng	What if they kill her?
10928174	eng	What if they kill him?
10928287	eng	My uncle was a tailor.
10928343	eng	They finally broke the silence.
10928348	eng	Put everything in the box.
10928350	eng	She didn't show up today?
10928618	eng	Don't try to bamboozle me.
10928864	eng	I do need a drink.
10928909	eng	We had lunch with Tom.
10929087	eng	I am traveling by train.
10929092	eng	Let's go to the market!
10929102	eng	Hello, Peter, how are you?
10929106	eng	This is my wife Anda.
10930334	eng	I also work on Sundays.
10930335	eng	I work on Sundays, too.
10930401	eng	I'm a very slower walker.
10930549	eng	He didn't even bother replying.
10930553	eng	She didn't even bother replying.
10930558	eng	They didn't even bother replying.
10930626	eng	It was an arduous trip.
10931029	eng	Tom has a twin sister.
10931075	eng	Everything okay, brother? Be well.
10931290	eng	Please, put the kettle on!
10931332	eng	I will eat an orange.
10931342	eng	I'm going to the university.
10931345	eng	I give her a book.
10931346	eng	I give him a book.
10931354	eng	You seem full of anger.
10931373	eng	He reads in his room.
10931376	eng	And who might she be?
10931560	eng	She spat on the floor.
10931839	eng	Is he able to type?
10932163	eng	I'm in the swimming pool.
10932459	eng	Berbers were very clever craftsmen.
10932461	eng	Berbers call their language "Tamazight."
10932466	eng	It's important to study Algeria.
10932470	eng	Does Algeria have cheap labor?
10932523	eng	This is my favorite bookshop.
10932536	eng	This is my favorite one.
10932545	eng	This is my favorite recipe.
10932546	eng	This is my favorite game.
10932548	eng	This is my favorite website.
10932549	eng	This is my favorite jacket.
10932552	eng	This is my favorite T-shirt.
10932554	eng	This is my favorite drink.
10932555	eng	This is my favorite cocktail.
10932789	eng	It's crawling with cops outside.
10932795	eng	Actually, I don't enjoy cooking.
10932802	eng	They're starting to throw things.
10932806	eng	This isn't knitting. It's weaving.
10932945	eng	Don't watch me, watch Tom.
10933134	eng	Did you receive her invitation?
10933181	eng	Tom has finished his drink.
10933185	eng	Tom has given Mary something.
10933192	eng	Tom has three adopted children.
10933259	eng	This story is absolutely terrific.
10933260	eng	The unemployment rate is alarming.
10933324	eng	You take too many risks.
10933400	eng	I'll get dressed for church.
10933434	eng	He has picked some flowers.
10933439	eng	That man is from Africa.
10933448	eng	Whose clothes are you washing?
10933461	eng	Albert had just gone out.
10933473	eng	Which house do you prefer?
10933482	eng	You want to return tomorrow.
10933492	eng	The woman is having breakfast.
10933510	eng	He went to school running.
10933528	eng	He is a tall man.
10934495	eng	Lithuania has started blockading Kaliningrad.
10934505	eng	Lithuania joined NATO in 2004.
10934507	eng	Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.
10934516	eng	Ziri has to write well.
10934560	eng	That's why we were late.
10934561	eng	I've thrown that away already.
10934563	eng	How does this machine work?
10934566	eng	It's difficult to speak French.
10934569	eng	I've met Tom many times.
10934642	eng	You can consider yourself lucky.
10934768	eng	You should consider yourself lucky.
10934783	eng	Womanizing is hard to overcome.
10934820	eng	Ziri wants to stop womanizing.
10934886	eng	Ziri spoke to the press.
10934898	eng	President Tebboune is consolidating power.
10935155	eng	I would have gladly come!
10935262	eng	It was a great success.
10935264	eng	It was a good clock.
10935267	eng	It was of no use.
10935268	eng	It was now near midnight.
10935269	eng	It was a suicidal stunt.
10935326	eng	I have a 2D wife.
10935327	eng	I'm a man of culture.
10935361	eng	I thought they'd hear us.
10935401	eng	Things aren't as they appear.
10935406	eng	Tom wants to practice driving.
10935437	eng	However, this idea was discarded.
10935439	eng	Production numbers are not known.
10935441	eng	Three other princes were poisoned.
10935442	eng	The building was severely damaged.
10935457	eng	Various tunnels have been proposed.
10935461	eng	Both admitted committing the crime.
10935471	eng	Afterwards, they became good friends.
10935472	eng	The passenger survived the incident.
10935475	eng	Eventually, a settlement was reached.
10935489	eng	However, these fears proved unfounded.
10935491	eng	Nevertheless, it had some limitations.
10935497	eng	Several decades of prosperity followed.
10935499	eng	The company's archives have survived.
10935502	eng	The lighthouse suffered minimal damage.
10935514	eng	I really enjoy your posts.
10935515	eng	Tom arrived a bit late.
10936035	eng	Under these circumstances, it's understandable.
10936183	eng	Tom has already been alerted.
10936345	eng	The risk is actually low.
10936381	eng	All representatives serve four-year terms.
10936394	eng	Additionally, three civilians were killed.
10936557	eng	This book is about anthropology.
10936605	eng	Yes, you've already said that.
10936782	eng	I'm an inhabitant of Earth.
10936787	eng	The legislature enacted sweeping laws.
10936791	eng	The legislature enacted far-reaching laws.
10936803	eng	He switched schools last year.
10936804	eng	OK, what shall I sing?
10936825	eng	Have you ever had surgery?
10936974	eng	This pot has no lid.
10937139	eng	Don't eat so much meat.
10937185	eng	This isn't a cheap hotel.
10937570	eng	Tom couldn't recall meeting us.
10937602	eng	Tom looked different back then.
10937606	eng	Take me to Tom, please.
10938294	eng	Tom should call his doctor.
10938342	eng	Probably I was unduly straight.
10938349	eng	All your comments are excessive.
10938362	eng	How do they treat SARS?
10938391	eng	What more can be done?
10939523	eng	I like that chord progression.
10939556	eng	Yes, but it doesn't matter.
10939558	eng	Yes, but that's not important.
10939570	eng	I think Tom was homesick.
10939787	eng	Tom drove her into safety.
10939966	eng	We'd better be very careful.
10941069	eng	The whole world knows it.
10941184	eng	Tom had a flat tire.
10941208	eng	Scotland is my adopted country.
10941221	eng	It's green. Let's cross over.
10941222	eng	The light's green. Let's cross.
10941361	eng	That was a huge success.
10941362	eng	That was a great success.
10942409	eng	Ziri turned the phone off.
10942419	eng	Ziri walked out the door.
10942476	eng	That's why I always lose.
10942480	eng	The rules are quite strict.
10942481	eng	The rules were quite strict.
10942482	eng	The rules were very strict.
10942483	eng	The regulations are quite strict.
10942494	eng	I think everything tasted good.
10942495	eng	Everything Tom cooked was delicious.

10952039	eng	This man is really stupid.
10952230	eng	It was a miserable trip.
10952307	eng	How tall are you now?
10952421	eng	The children were very rude.
10952454	eng	Tom wasn't aware of that.

10953741	eng	Was there a refund policy?
10953742	eng	Is there a refund policy?
10953773	eng	Tom never apologized to me.
10953792	eng	I'm not searching for anything.
10953857	eng	This shop closes at nine.
10953870	eng	Tom has a nasty personality.

10954391	eng	Ziri has run off again.
10954467	eng	Tom has millions of dollars.
10954524	eng	Ziri was obsessed with charity.
10954904	eng	Mary knitted herself a scarf.
10954930	eng	Everyone is looking at you.
10954945	eng	It seems Tom was lying.
10954972	eng	It gets really hot here.
10954982	eng	I'm very sorry you failed.
10954983	eng	Tom liked to help people.
10954990	eng	I didn't sign that document.
10955002	eng	Tom has nowhere to hide.
10955041	eng	Stick around for a while.
10955070	eng	Maybe I could do something.
10955956	eng	Tom has postponed his trip.
10956273	eng	You had better obey Tom.
10956348	eng	Tom has a great job.
10956510	eng	Tom had a hard day.
10957066	eng	Will you be my beloved?
10957071	eng	Tom is difficult to please.
10957313	eng	A refractory material resists heat.
10957357	eng	My brother-in-law died last Wednesday.
10957526	eng	All thirty people were rescued.
10958175	eng	Tom can't hurt you now.
10958196	eng	That might not be correct.
10958198	eng	That's likely to be wrong.

10958222	eng	You've never dated, have you?
10958227	eng	Tom has a good wife.
10958228	eng	Little things please little minds.
10958276	eng	The children were never satisfied.
10958277	eng	They were artists, not biologists.
10958298	eng	I nearly missed my bus.
10959295	eng	There was one difficulty, however.
10959336	eng	There are protests in Libya.
10959337	eng	Libya has two rival parliaments.
10959341	eng	Khalifa Haftar holds American nationality.
10959354	eng	Ziri kept smiling at Rima.
10959379	eng	Who cares what Tom does.
10959412	eng	How much does he cost?
10959414	eng	Keep your eyes to yourself.
10959425	eng	Tom turned the log over.
10959462	eng	Ziri is a hardcore womanizer.
10959463	eng	With that, Ziri stormed off.

10959590	eng	Ziri washed off the paint.
10959603	eng	Ziri brushed the thought aside.
10959608	eng	Ziri waved the waiter over.
10959636	eng	A registration process is required.
10959637	eng	The restaurant was quite expensive.
10959639	eng	This statement is completely false.
10959652	eng	Ziri climbed through the window.
10959659	eng	Ziri made up an excuse.
10959674	eng	Welcome to our research laboratory.
10959688	eng	My mother has rheumatoid arthritis.
10959692	eng	The mechanic was particularly tall.
10959718	eng	It's a pretty specialized position.
10959719	eng	That was someone else's handiwork.
10959722	eng	Ziri opened up the door.
10959729	eng	Ziri missed Rima's hilarious jokes.
10959744	eng	The suspect hasn't been identified.
10959781	eng	Ziri looked down in shame.
10959802	eng	Something terrible's happened to me.
10959813	eng	The biological threat was contained.
10959816	eng	There was no justification provided.
10959819	eng	Cats truly are mysterious creatures.
10959838	eng	Ziri's fake mustache came off.
10959854	eng	Ziri acted like a robot.

10960020	eng	Open the door a smidge.
10960025	eng	I'll ring you again later.

10960079	eng	He's cooking in his kitchen.
10960083	eng	Has Ziri's luck run out?
10960185	eng	The rhythm is unmistakably familiar.
10960197	eng	The police aborted the investigation.
10960204	eng	That really doesn't seem appropriate.
10960219	eng	Tom shouted insults at us.
10960225	eng	Uranium and plutonium are radioactive.
10960227	eng	Software development can be expensive.

10960274	eng	Is Tom sure of that?
10960275	eng	Is Tom sure about that?
10960276	eng	Ziri went into the diner.
10960285	eng	Unfortunately, the choice is permanent.

10965699	eng	Ziri tiptoed into the kitchen.
10965703	eng	What's the quickest way there?
10965716	eng	Ziri ran for the exit.
10965740	eng	Tom has admitted to that.
10965750	eng	Ziri picked up his sandwich.

10965816	eng	Ziri pushed Rima away roughly.
10965825	eng	Ziri got onto the stage.
10965841	eng	Ziri was immediately taken away.
10965853	eng	Ziri came in just then.
10965976	eng	Not a word was spoken.
10965977	eng	Put your trust in God.
10965979	eng	I only know the refrain.

10966530	eng	Tom must be doing well.
10967068	eng	Tom called him a monster.
10967076	eng	Why aren't you in bed?
10967079	eng	Tom has never denied that.
10967081	eng	It's not easy to describe.
10967084	eng	I may go to Boston.
10967087	eng	Tom has already been there.
10967090	eng	I'll probably go to Boston.
10967091	eng	Perhaps I'll go to Boston.
10967094	eng	I'll likely go to Boston.
10967111	eng	You should call Tom first.

10967353	eng	Father, where is my glass?
10967357	eng	Tom never misses the target.
10967374	eng	I've been sleeping better recently.
10967395	eng	Tom has lost all credibility.
10967413	eng	I'm not fooling around, guys.
10968505	eng	Ziri went on bothering Rima.

10968550	eng	Deep down, Ziri envied Rima.

10970739	eng	I just got back yesterday.
10970742	eng	I think I was right.
10970745	eng	There wasn't anything to eat.
10970755	eng	Thanks for the interesting conversation.

10971049	eng	Tom's trumpet solo was incredible.
10971078	eng	Tom suggested we go together.
10971119	eng	Do that one more time.
10971180	eng	We weren't allowed to enter.
10971358	eng	He shook his head angrily.
10971450	eng	Tom has been unusually quiet.
10971651	eng	Tom wasn't doing his job.
10971790	eng	Don't try to save me.
10971793	eng	Tom wanted to believe that.
10971811	eng	Don't tell Tom about us.
10971862	eng	Let's do it on Monday.
10971870	eng	What was to be done?
10971872	eng	I don't like this car.

10973268	eng	Can you describe the pain?
10973330	eng	I stayed there until 2:30.
10973471	eng	Just give me more time.

10973542	eng	Ziri got jealous and angry.
10973548	eng	Ziri has taken Rima in.
10973550	eng	Grab your rucksack and hurry.
10973555	eng	Ziri almost kicked Rima out.
10973571	eng	Raccoons are mammals as well.
10973577	eng	The yield is essentially zero.
10973586	eng	Ziri started shouting at Rima.
10973592	eng	This investment won't pay off.
10973608	eng	I don't accept that diagnosis.
10973620	eng	Ziri was jumping for joy.
10973629	eng	Ziri walked into his house.
10973641	eng	Ziri kicked that guy out.
10973647	eng	Ziri only cared about Rima.
10973651	eng	Ziri shouted for everyone's attention.
10973652	eng	Ziri can come home now.
10973687	eng	Have you been on Insta?
10973689	eng	Ziri needs to slow down.
10973766	eng	Half the audience fell asleep.
10973783	eng	Tom has never helped us.
10973819	eng	Do you remember it fondly?
10974068	eng	Tom showed us around town.
10974105	eng	We can't give up hope.
10974268	eng	The medicine was in capsules.
10974283	eng	For him, time was money.

10975703	eng	Why don't you stick around?
10975730	eng	Tom can't do this now.
10975817	eng	Tom put on a mask.
10975941	eng	I'm not saying it's right.
10976216	eng	I'll stick around a while.

10976232	eng	Who's that with the hat?
10976233	eng	Get me a pitcher's glove.
10976235	eng	Why should it be awkward?
10976245	eng	We'll pay all your expenses.
10976247	eng	Nothing's the matter with me.
10976292	eng	Who boarded up these windows?
10976393	eng	Tom's needs must be respected.
10976654	eng	I wasn't working that night.
10976715	eng	I'm sure everyone would agree.
10976845	eng	If not me, then who?
10977007	eng	That's not fair at all.
10977010	eng	Monday won't work for me.
10977011	eng	Strike while the iron's hot.
10977035	eng	Why couldn't Tom be here?
10977100	eng	I was tying my shoelaces.
10977106	eng	It's only quarter to eight.
10977111	eng	Can I pay by cash?
10977112	eng	Can I pay in cash?
10977127	eng	It's a quarter to five.
10977131	eng	He drove on the motorway.

10979751	eng	I'm beginning to realize that.
10979759	eng	Tom is an offensive person.
10979797	eng	I should be doing that.
10979798	eng	Let's stop talking about Tom.
10979820	eng	The moon isn't hollow, Tom.
10979825	eng	I learned from our mistakes.

10982486	eng	The keeper was class today.
10982495	eng	Every pupil expressed their opinion.
10982518	eng	My favourite cake is cheesecake.
10982528	eng	Help yourself to a biscuit.

10982572	eng	Would you like a pint?
10982636	eng	Tom had to work yesterday.
10983464	eng	This is probably web jargon.
10983487	eng	The doctor removed her gloves.
10983826	eng	This rule is so inhumane.
10983834	eng	I'm very happy to come.
10983886	eng	It can be very eye-opening.
10983896	eng	I'm feeling better every day.
10983926	eng	I always study by myself.
10983960	eng	What happened to her face?
10984066	eng	It's time to let go.

10984780	eng	Tom? Are you with us?
10984896	eng	That's enough sugar for today.
10984900	eng	Thankfully, she got paid yesterday.

11169907	eng	They laugh and, moreover, uproariously.
11170053	eng	I came for you, Tom.
11170477	eng	I'm afraid of dying alone.
11170481	eng	What time would be good?
11170485	eng	How do you like this?
11170486	eng	May I take you home?
11170504	eng	I'm not a dairy farmer.
11170505	eng	Please lend it to me.
11170508	eng	I'm not a spy anymore.
11170512	eng	I'm going to eat this.
11170513	eng	I don't like this plan.
11170520	eng	Where do I change trains?
11170522	eng	May I have some change?
11170527	eng	Thank you for arranging this.
11170557	eng	I know you'll like it.
11170558	eng	My cat purrs a lot.
11170560	eng	What does it come to?
11170564	eng	I'm not a bad actor.
11170570	eng	What time should I come?
11170573	eng	I should've changed that lock.
11170574	eng	I should've changed the locks.
11170576	eng	I'm not a good father.
11170578	eng	I'm not a detective anymore.
11170592	eng	I won't listen to Tom.

11171137	eng	The box was successfully opened.
11171139	eng	Ziri memorized the magic spell.
11171143	eng	Ziri intervened in the fight.
11171148	eng	Ziri mastered Walid's fighting techniques.
11171152	eng	She has missed her chance.
11171153	eng	Ziri got into the palace.
11171156	eng	We will never give up!
11171164	eng	Ziri is a terraforming specialist.
11171167	eng	The robot lurched at Ziri.
11171168	eng	Ziri ran out of oxygen.
11171170	eng	Ziri took off his helmet.
11171172	eng	Ziri shut down the robot.
11171201	eng	Ziri began to run away.
11171211	eng	Ziri looked around in confusion.
11171218	eng	Ziri managed to get up.
11171228	eng	Ziri rushed into the cave.
11171232	eng	The monster passed out immediately.
11171238	eng	The monster sustained serious injuries.
11171241	eng	Rima's tears turned into icicles.
11171244	eng	Ziri got into the shower.
11171272	eng	Nathalue knows what is good.
11171286	eng	The storm was closing in.
11171288	eng	The demon started flying backwards.
11171291	eng	Ziri fell down in pain.
11171294	eng	Ziri began turning to dust.
11171326	eng	Ziri rushed inside the building.
11171338	eng	Ziri threw away his uniform.
11171360	eng	Ziri came out from hiding.
11171386	eng	Ziri screamed furiously at Rima.
11171390	eng	People ran away in fear.
11171391	eng	The ceiling began falling down.
11171392	eng	Ziri got into the chopper.
11171435	eng	Rima politely turned Ziri down.
11171443	eng	Ziri saw Rima walk in.
11171449	eng	Berber was Ziri's favorite subject.
11171458	eng	I'm so done with you.
11171465	eng	There're people who trust politicians.
11171479	eng	He drew with black ink.
11171488	eng	How do you make this?
11171494	eng	Answer, please, yes or no.
11171507	eng	I saw only angry reactions.
11171515	eng	Her garden is really small.
11171554	eng	Why did you follow me?
11171615	eng	There's nothing more to do.
11171643	eng	"What's the matter?" she called.
11171739	eng	I miss Tom's pithy observations.
11171746	eng	We are outside your house.
11171807	eng	Do you like our furniture?
11171890	eng	How did this project start?
11172131	eng	What is the final amount?
11172241	eng	We live on an island.
11172538	eng	There wasn't much to see.
11172550	eng	How do you pronounce "pretty"?
11172554	eng	All the information is encrypted.
11172590	eng	I need a sharper knife.
11172779	eng	That may be a possibility.
11172790	eng	Where does this bus go?
11172793	eng	Tell me your lowest price.
11172794	eng	Hurry, or we'll be late.
11172803	eng	I'm not a pastry chef.
11172832	eng	Tom is now an orphan.
11172834	eng	Good to see you again.
11172837	eng	What difference will it make?
11172838	eng	Look what Tom gave me.
11172853	eng	My weight is seventy-five kilos.
11172899	eng	Does your conscience haunt you?
11172977	eng	Don't run a red light.
11172983	eng	The referee called a foul.
11173050	eng	He's got to be kidding.
11173103	eng	He cut a fine figure.
11173177	eng	Those towels should be clean.
11173178	eng	That towel should be clean.
11173225	eng	It makes no difference now.
11173240	eng	What rank do you hold?
11173244	eng	Tom speaks French rather well.
11173255	eng	Ziri spent money on Rima.
11173258	eng	I was treated with respect.
11173260	eng	Ziri's eyes widened with glee.
11173262	eng	Ziri stood up and left.
11173271	eng	Rima left Ziri for money.
11173279	eng	Ziri is paying the price.
11173297	eng	Is this picture for sale?
11173298	eng	Are these flowers for sale?
11173305	eng	Ziri dropped to his knees.
11173316	eng	Ziri loved Rima to pieces.
11173350	eng	Ziri walked to the house.
11173360	eng	Ziri had Rima running errands.
11173365	eng	Ziri rubbed the puppy's belly.
11173374	eng	Ziri went inside the house.
11173398	eng	Ziri deliberately live in poverty.
11173399	eng	I'll do as you suggest.
11173402	eng	Ziri was studying foreign languages.
11173406	eng	Ziri smiled like an idiot.
11173421	eng	Ziri appeared in the hallway.
11173432	eng	Ziri is from the countryside.
11173433	eng	I was deep in thought.
11173434	eng	Ziri is preparing for college.
11173436	eng	Ziri is from a village.
11173442	eng	Ziri straightened up and beamed.
11173445	eng	It was actually Ziri's idea.
11173457	eng	Ziri dodged the question again.
11173477	eng	Ziri's clothes really were fashionable.
11173482	eng	Ziri is such a jerk.
11173483	eng	Ziri went to his house.
11173492	eng	Ziri got a bad mark.
11173493	eng	Ziri embarrassed himself at school.
11173524	eng	Now we're a real family.
11173527	eng	Rima had a poor boyfriend.
11173548	eng	Ziri went downstairs for dinner.
11173561	eng	Ziri believed that stupid lie.
11173572	eng	Ziri is a good listener.
11173574	eng	No one is at home.
11173580	eng	Ziri started losing his mind.
11173585	eng	Is Tom cross with us?
11173589	eng	Is Tom angry with us?
11173596	eng	Tom is cross with us.
11173601	eng	Ziri was the village hero.
11173624	eng	Ask Tom whether it's true.
11173634	eng	Rima was a real beauty.
11173645	eng	Rima covered up her pimples.
11173647	eng	Ziri jumped into the pool.
11173648	eng	Ziri was afraid of water.
11173661	eng	Ziri mostly stayed at home.
11173666	eng	Tom was cross with Mary.
11173686	eng	Ziri increased the music volume.
11173689	eng	Ziri told Rima his secrets.
11173696	eng	Ziri took Rima on dates.
11173705	eng	Ziri canceled the photo shoot.
11173710	eng	Ziri gave Rima a hint.
11173719	eng	Shawi music started to play.
11173720	eng	Ziri's heart started to play.
11173722	eng	Let's hurry. We're already late.
11173728	eng	Ziri is afraid of water.
11173734	eng	Ziri's triumph didn't last long.
11173740	eng	Let's ask Tom to sing.
11173741	eng	Let's ask Tom to cook.
11173742	eng	Let's ask Tom to dance.

11173777	eng	Ziri has news for Rima.
11173793	eng	Rima wore a Gucci dress.
11173794	eng	Are you free tonight, Ziri?
11173808	eng	Ziri has to drink champagne.
11173829	eng	The navigation was temporarily interrupted.
11173862	eng	The cop let Ziri go.
11173872	eng	Ziri went to the sea.
11173875	eng	I'll stay until the evening.
11173879	eng	Has the rain season begun?
11173888	eng	Ziri looks like a local.
11173910	eng	Please wipe the table off.
11173914	eng	Money made Ziri so arrogant.
11173935	eng	Ziri came here for business.
11173949	eng	Rima is a real lady.
11173963	eng	Ziri cleaned his combat boots.
11173964	eng	Ziri has to fix this.
11173966	eng	Ziri's parents exchanged tense glances.
11173983	eng	Ziri chose the wrong book.
11173988	eng	The rain doesn't bother us.
11173996	eng	Ziri put on combat shoes.
11173997	eng	Ziri heard some students giggling.
11174002	eng	Ziri broke the door himself.
11174006	eng	Ziri got home from school.
11174008	eng	There were only snobs there.
11174011	eng	Ziri broke his locker himself.
11174036	eng	Rima is a spoiled brute.
11174042	eng	Ziri took away the phone.
11174046	eng	Ziri already had some fans.
11174051	eng	Ziri learnt Berber from scratch.
11174052	eng	Ziri searched for Rima online.
11174053	eng	We missed a golden opportunity.
11174076	eng	I live in the restaurant.
11174088	eng	I do not like conflicts.
11174100	eng	Ultimately, the entire family reunited.
11174104	eng	Tom is an imaginary patient.
11174110	eng	Imagine, even I have imagination.
11174113	eng	If we are not tired?
11174124	eng	From which planet are you?
11174129	eng	The letter is not signed.
11174140	eng	He has went back up.
11174143	eng	They are probably in love.
11174148	eng	Have I really written that?

11174172	eng	Ziri practices Berber every day.
11174192	eng	Ziri uses Berber every day.
11174196	eng	Is Ziri conversational in Berber?
11174212	eng	The guests liked Ziri's performance.
11174213	eng	Ziri definitely began his revenge.
11174217	eng	The CIA tortured Ziri psychologically.
11174239	eng	Sorry for calling so late.
11174251	eng	Horses are better than machines.
11174256	eng	The girl looked around apprehensively.
11174273	eng	Did it do any good?
11174332	eng	Tom got here before us.
11174351	eng	It was written in French.
11174361	eng	Ziri removed the battery manually.
11174369	eng	Ziri's spacesuit protected him temporarily.
11174371	eng	Ziri finally completed his mission.
11174380	eng	What are our main challenges?
11174383	eng	What if he doesn't come?
11174400	eng	Everything went well last weekend.
11174419	eng	This isn't our only problem.
11174423	eng	You should have called first.
11174426	eng	Let's discuss the details later.

11174638	eng	Who's going to the beach?
11174655	eng	You need to eat well.
11174683	eng	Tom won't deal with that.
11174711	eng	Thanks for the warm welcome!
11174730	eng	Tom blocked me for that.
11174788	eng	I go to my bed.
11174801	eng	Can you recognise Tom's voice?
11174830	eng	I'll make something to eat.
11174836	eng	The sea is warm today.
11174879	eng	The cat was meowing incessantly.
11174902	eng	Heat yourself up some soup.
11174905	eng	There's just two months left.
11174916	eng	Give Tom your phone number.
11175220	eng	Back up a little more.
11175229	eng	Show me where to go.
11175250	eng	Please show it to me.
11175281	eng	Could you take a message?
11175282	eng	I want something like this.
11175396	eng	Her mental development was slow.
11175439	eng	Who does he play with?
11175446	eng	He should be here now.
11175567	eng	The toilet door is closed.
11175720	eng	I'll be back by dawn.
11175725	eng	Tom handed in his resignation.
11175726	eng	I was afraid to talk.
11175728	eng	Tom got home very late.
11175730	eng	Do it for me, please.
11175731	eng	I've only done this once.
11175736	eng	You can't make me go.
11175743	eng	I'm having a difficult week.
11175746	eng	We're always ahead of schedule.
11175817	eng	I'm too tired to continue.
11175826	eng	It would've taken me longer.
11175835	eng	I didn't reach my goal.
11175837	eng	The soundtrack is very nice.
11175851	eng	It's been a tough year.
11175868	eng	Let's hope it's sunny tomorrow.
11175912	eng	We go skiing every winter.
11175921	eng	Do you have any envelopes?
11175923	eng	We have no more milk.
11175994	eng	Above all, let's not panic.
11176030	eng	We can't live without love.
11176039	eng	Leave my family in peace.
11176041	eng	The play started on time.
11176055	eng	That's not what surprises me.
11176057	eng	That's not what surprised me.
11176068	eng	I'm trying a new recipe.
11176087	eng	You'll see me again soon.
11176102	eng	I'm looking for my laptop.
11176152	eng	The test result was negative.
11176161	eng	Tom couldn't pick the lock.
11176166	eng	Hopefully, things will improve soon.
11176167	eng	There's no need to continue.
11176171	eng	We arrived earlier than expected.
11176200	eng	Do you pray every day?
11176263	eng	Why are you threatening me?
11176269	eng	Do not take my life!
11176280	eng	The bee uses all flowers.
11176286	eng	I walk by the river.

11176372	eng	I didn't add enough salt.
11176374	eng	I added too much water.
11176375	eng	I didn't add enough milk.
11176383	eng	I heard Tom got injured.

11176472	eng	He has it over himself.
11176479	eng	I would like to contribute.
11176480	eng	Give us an answer first.

11200990	eng	The water is running downhill.
11201040	eng	Suddenly, her face went pale.
11201043	eng	I appear to be lost.
11201048	eng	I'm going to the shop.
11201068	eng	She needs to go shopping.
11201082	eng	Why are you so odd?
11201085	eng	Who is allowed to vote?
11201089	eng	That will take all day.
11201100	eng	Paul has never seen snow.
11201137	eng	He began reading the book.
11201152	eng	Ziri scared the homeless guy.
11201156	eng	I've replaced the kitchen tap.
11201169	eng	Ziri remained at the table.
11201229	eng	The sun was going down.
11201231	eng	Ziri set up the tent.
11201235	eng	Ziri pitched his own tent.
11201239	eng	Ziri is pissed off now.
11201256	eng	The laughing got even closer.
11201258	eng	Ziri understands what Rima means.
11201261	eng	Ziri sat there in silence.
11201273	eng	Ziri hasn't been camping since.
11201276	eng	Ziri is still watching Rima.
11201280	eng	Ziri was a sketchy-looking guy.
11201282	eng	Ziri visited different camping spots.
11201289	eng	Ziri is camping over there.
11201291	eng	Ziri came there every day.
11201292	eng	Ziri was a homeless man.
11201294	eng	Ziri knew Rima was lying.
11201332	eng	Ziri was under the bed.
11201344	eng	Ziri's door was left open.
11201350	eng	Ziri went to the cul-de-sac.
11201354	eng	Ziri agreed to Rima's suggestion.
11201360	eng	Ziri sneakily approached the house.
11201361	eng	Ziri began observing the house.
11201364	eng	Ziri left the door unlocked.
11201365	eng	Ziri was a curious teen.
11201366	eng	Ziri explored the enormous house.
11201367	eng	Ziri broke into someone's house.
11201369	eng	Ziri was invading Rima's privacy.
11201371	eng	There was someone watching Ziri.
11201372	eng	Ziri broke into the place.
11201382	eng	I thought we were dead.
11201388	eng	Ziri started to become anxious.
11201406	eng	The door slammed behind Ziri.
11201408	eng	That wasn't even Ziri's idea.
11201410	eng	The office light was off.
11201413	eng	Ziri peeked his head around.
11201425	eng	Ziri noticed Rima notice him.
11201427	eng	Ziri was at Rima's window.
11201429	eng	Ziri should call the cops.
11201431	eng	Ziri made Rima feel better.
11201438	eng	Ziri has already gone home.
11201443	eng	Ziri was scared to death.
11201603	eng	We go there every year.
11201610	eng	Mary is an excellent student.
11201611	eng	She's mean all the time.
11201614	eng	Why aren't you coming tomorrow?
11201627	eng	Mary is making the beds.
11201640	eng	Departure is scheduled for tonight.
11201641	eng	Takeoff is scheduled for tonight.
11201648	eng	Don't be so angry, darling.
11201649	eng	Don't be so angry, sweetheart.
11201657	eng	I need urgent medical help.
11201659	eng	They can't hide the truth.
11201661	eng	They can't conceal the truth.
11201665	eng	Her ex-husband studied in London.
11201667	eng	His ex-husband studied in London.
11201686	eng	I know she was busy.
11201694	eng	Have you got another one?
11201711	eng	Do you sell fresh eggs?
11201713	eng	I'm almost always on time.
11201728	eng	He left and never returned.
11201729	eng	It hurts when I pee.
11201732	eng	Tom will cry about anything.
11201733	eng	I don't want anything sweet.
11201743	eng	Yes, that's how it works.
11201881	eng	I'm meeting him on Friday.
11201966	eng	He liked you a lot.
11202034	eng	Can we go much higher?
11202168	eng	You should wear a jacket.
11202259	eng	I'm learning to speak Tagalog.
11202505	eng	I don't like this keyboard.
11202510	eng	That was my first kiss.
11202549	eng	This heat is killing me.
11202554	eng	My dog has run away.
11202555	eng	Tom drinks tea every day.
11202558	eng	Don't leave. I'll be back.
11202560	eng	Tom's daughter is almost three.
11202563	eng	I'm going to make dinner.
11202564	eng	Let me make dinner tonight.
11202566	eng	Tom's voice is very nice.
11202594	eng	Who set this server up?
11202623	eng	Find out what is happening.
11202723	eng	Did you do the thing?
11202920	eng	See you next week, Tom!
11202921	eng	They could barely see anything.
11203023	eng	Ziri is a backpacking expert.
11203025	eng	Ziri loves relaxing in nature.
11203027	eng	Ziri likes the Appalachian Trail.
11203038	eng	Ziri took a logging road.
11203040	eng	The weather was relatively cool.
11203041	eng	Cool weather keeps mosquitoes away.
11203047	eng	Ziri settled into his tent.
11203057	eng	Ziri's tent had mesh windows.
11203058	eng	Ziri's tent has no windows.
11203064	eng	Ziri was making that noise.
11203090	eng	Ziri came home from college.
11203091	eng	Ziri was actually at school.
11203096	eng	Ziri listened to those stories.
11203103	eng	Ziri passed out relatively quickly.
11203107	eng	Ziri just set there, paralyzed.
11203108	eng	Ziri was joking with Rima.
11203123	eng	Ziri's severed finger was gone.
11203124	eng	Ziri never caught the guy.
11203127	eng	Ziri lost his athletic interest.
11203129	eng	Ziri loves the forest trail.
11203145	eng	Ziri was in the shadows.
11203156	eng	Why was Ziri doing that?
11203159	eng	Ziri reached the parking lot.
11203170	eng	The dark was a protection.
11203171	eng	The light switched on again.
11203176	eng	Ziri could hear the traffic.
11203211	eng	Ziri returned to the campsite.
11203220	eng	Ziri drifted off to sleep.
11203223	eng	Ziri was inside his tent.
11203225	eng	There was someone out there.
11203227	eng	Ziri rummaged through Rima's stuff.
11203238	eng	Ziri just stood there silently.
11203245	eng	Ziri's girlfriend was at work.
11203251	eng	The meadow was perfectly flat.
11203253	eng	Ziri drove through the meadow.
11203254	eng	Ziri approached the picnic table.
11203266	eng	Ziri felt completely on edge.
11203267	eng	Ziri left that strange area.
11203285	eng	Ziri was in the back.
11203298	eng	Ziri touched trash just now.
11203299	eng	Ziri treats people like garbage.
11203306	eng	Ziri noticed Rima's blue eyes.
11203309	eng	Ziri went with that woman.
11203310	eng	Something about Ziri is off.
11203314	eng	Ziri is just being paranoid.
11203315	eng	Ziri was happy for Rima.
11203316	eng	I couldn't help overhearing Ziri.
11203327	eng	Ziri needs to believe it.
11203375	eng	Ziri is paying Rima well.
11203376	eng	Ziri is treating Rima nicely.
11203377	eng	Ziri can't reach the jar.
11203387	eng	Ziri couldn't really trust Rima.
11203393	eng	Ziri could no longer sing.
11203430	eng	Ziri's treasure is in Algiers.
11203432	eng	Ziri still wants his money.
11203444	eng	Ziri preferred Rima to Walid.
11203445	eng	Ziri gave Rima his room.
11203452	eng	Ziri limped down the hallway.
11203464	eng	Ziri kept rubbing his eyes.
11203484	eng	Ziri wanted to strangle Rima.
11203514	eng	Ziri tore off his mask.
11203517	eng	Ziri ripped off Rima's mask.
11203711	eng	He's always getting mixed up.
11203787	eng	Judaism prefers actions to belief.
11204434	eng	Did Tom's advice help Mary?
11204449	eng	Doesn't that drive you mad?
11204457	eng	I never leave my house.
11204465	eng	How you treat people matters.
11204512	eng	Tom called Mary that night.
11204524	eng	The medic cauterized the wound.
11204532	eng	Belynda is my little sister.
11204578	eng	Tom heard Mary calling him.
11204662	eng	When will Tom understand it?
11204670	eng	Are your children all right?
11204734	eng	How are you my beloved?
11204848	eng	I'll be back before Tom.
11205064	eng	I'm not motivated enough today.
11205308	eng	Will he be coming back?
11205326	eng	She has a superiority complex.
11205328	eng	She's got a superiority complex.
11205332	eng	Everything is going as usual.
11205357	eng	He's just appeared from nowhere.
11205359	eng	He just appeared from nowhere.
11205361	eng	It's brass monkeys at home.
11205374	eng	Mary has little to say.
11205377	eng	We'll be going with Tom.
11205385	eng	And how did you answer?
11205386	eng	And how did you reply?
11205387	eng	And what was your reply?
11205388	eng	And what was your answer?
11205397	eng	Don't do it like that.
11205411	eng	I read a book yesterday.
11205417	eng	Genoa's old town is picturesque.
11205432	eng	His handwriting is really nice.
11205434	eng	Her handwriting is really nice.
11205446	eng	He was the last customer.
11205464	eng	You've got a good vocabulary.
11205465	eng	You have a good vocabulary.
11205475	eng	What are they hoping for?
11205477	eng	Sit further away from me.
11205482	eng	Ziri went into the woods.
11205488	eng	Tom's flawless French astonished us.
11205490	eng	Ziri was an overweight teen.
11205505	eng	The gazelle suddenly stopped moving.
11205515	eng	The gazelle's intestines were moving.
11205523	eng	The gazelle did not move.
11205528	eng	Ziri passed the fourth campsite.
11205529	eng	Ziri's leg were killing him.
11205546	eng	The gazelle stopped moving completely.
11205552	eng	The gazelle opened its mouth.
11205556	eng	Ziri sat there in disbelief.
11205575	eng	Ziri's truck started just fine.
11205581	eng	Ziri wants to stay safe.
11205582	eng	The gazelle kept following Ziri.
11205590	eng	Ziri picked us all up.
11205595	eng	Ziri went on his own.
11205602	eng	We all heard the sound.
11205606	eng	Ziri knew that wasn't Rima.
11205610	eng	Ziri's voice sounded too fake.
11205612	eng	That's not funny any more!
11205615	eng	That's not funny any more.
11205617	eng	Ziri heard the voice again.
11205621	eng	Was it really a gazelle?
11205622	eng	This isn't spoken about much.
11205626	eng	Ziri didn't offer any suggestions.
11205629	eng	Ziri continued down the road.
11205632	eng	The bird was changing location.
11205645	eng	Ziri heard the bird again.
11205646	eng	Ziri recognized the voice instantly.
11205653	eng	This area is for cattle.
11205671	eng	The lights came back slowly.
11205685	eng	What's Ziri's excuse this time?
11205692	eng	Ziri was angry as well.
11205707	eng	Ziri set up a hammock.
11205709	eng	Ziri got into his tent.
11205713	eng	Ziri thought everything was fine.
11205714	eng	Ziri went back to sleep.
11205716	eng	Ziri turned on his headlamp.
11205727	eng	These stories fit today's topic.
11205734	eng	Ziri headed up the mountain.
11205743	eng	Ziri turned off his light.
11205744	eng	Ziri bolted back to town.
11205747	eng	Ziri ran back to town.
11205756	eng	Ziri went hiking at night.
11205762	eng	Jackals do invade human territory.
11205776	eng	Ziri is addicted to hikes.
11205779	eng	Ziri has no hunting license.
11205794	eng	Ziri walked towards the pen.
11205805	eng	Ziri was on edge again.
11205823	eng	The bear stepped backwards slightly.
11205831	eng	Ziri came from behind Rima.
11205854	eng	The landscape was absolutely breathtaking.
11205864	eng	Ziri was traveling by foot.
11205867	eng	Ziri looked at the sky.
11205877	eng	Ziri was a curious child.
11205886	eng	Ziri got out to inspect.
11205913	eng	Jinns live in the desert.
11205914	eng	Jinns can talk to people.
11205917	eng	The Persians never reached Siwa.
11205918	eng	People in Siwa speak Berber.
11206011	eng	Ziri pampered Rima with gifts.
11206022	eng	The Garamantes ruled the Sahara.
11206061	eng	The Mongols overran the Persians.
11206064	eng	Al-Kahina defeated the Arab conquest.
11206074	eng	Islam is a world religion.
11206151	eng	You have to ask Tom.
11206520	eng	Karl Marx wasn't a Marxist.
11206549	eng	Words alone mean absolutely nothing.
11206561	eng	I disagree with this absolutely.
11206565	eng	David categorically opposed Ann's proposal.
11206714	eng	Remember to grab your headphones.
11206715	eng	There's a new episode out.
11206850	eng	Tom was our platoon leader.
11206865	eng	All my money got stolen.
11206874	eng	Mary isn't all that attractive.
11206934	eng	What if they kill you?
11206975	eng	Thanks for doing your part.
11206976	eng	You're a pretty creative guy.
11207058	eng	Dad wants to see us.
11207217	eng	Tom Jackson must step down.
11207302	eng	My English is not feminine.
11207513	eng	Ziri took the video down.
11207525	eng	Ziri enjoyed working with Rima.
11207530	eng	Ziri called out Rima's name.
11207534	eng	Ziri waited for four minutes.
11207538	eng	Again, there was no response.
11207540	eng	Ziri still didn't show up.
11207541	eng	Ziri began to get worried.
11207545	eng	Ziri was on the trail.
11207550	eng	Ziri continued to ignore Rima.
11207552	eng	Ziri just stared at Rima.
11207555	eng	Another forty minutes went by.
11207557	eng	Ziri is not under arrest.
11207560	eng	Ziri found the missing person.
11207571	eng	Ziri will tell Rima later.
11207586	eng	Ziri is done with this.
11207592	eng	Ziri had a pepper grenade.
11207595	eng	Ziri didn't get any sleep.
11207609	eng	Ziri went on a hike.
11207614	eng	Ziri spotted a gazelle earlier.
11207621	eng	The gazelle seemed abnormally large.
11207631	eng	Ziri went into his tent.
11207633	eng	Ziri had a nap there.
11207634	eng	Ziri was walking very awkwardly.
11207639	eng	Ziri and Rima were sleep-deprived.
11207653	eng	Ziri was not moving normally.
11207655	eng	Ziri came in that truck.
11207661	eng	Ziri got back to camp.
11207664	eng	Ziri was taking a piss.
11207667	eng	Ziri was a weird kid.
11207669	eng	Ziri hasn't come back yet.
11207676	eng	Ziri searched for his flashlight.
11207680	eng	The forest was silent again.
11207698	eng	Ziri heard footsteps behind him.
11207702	eng	Ziri quickly pulled his pistol.
11207705	eng	Ziri is a forest ranger.
11207710	eng	This story is from Ziri.
11207716	eng	Ziri was standing outside, waiting.
11207718	eng	The picnic tables were broken.
11207722	eng	Ziri heard and saw nothing.
11207740	eng	Horrific screams filled the air.
11207767	eng	Ziri called the park director.
11207787	eng	Ziri finally made it there.
11207795	eng	Ziri was still close by.
11207796	eng	Ziri messed with Rima's stuff.
11207800	eng	Ziri brought his bear spray.
11207820	eng	Ziri was in a cult.
11207823	eng	Ziri never goes there alone.
11207826	eng	Ziri listened to his instincts.
11207831	eng	Tom is a multifaceted player.
11207846	eng	Ziri heard a fire siren.
11207849	eng	The tracks were definitely fresh.
11207854	eng	Ziri went on the porch.
11207859	eng	Ziri pulled up his covers.
11207860	eng	Ziri ran towards the window.
11207861	eng	The rumbling sound never stopped.
11207874	eng	Ziri smelt the rotting odor.
11207882	eng	The creature terrorized the villagers.
11207899	eng	The Tuareg women were dancing.
11207903	eng	The camel reached the stream.
11207905	eng	He lives in the countryside.
11208703	eng	What was your hometown like?
11208818	eng	I knew her pretty well.
11208819	eng	I'm not strong at all.
11208824	eng	Pour the man some coffee.
11208832	eng	Pour the woman some coffee.
11209206	eng	I'm going to the chemist's.
11209229	eng	These problems are ultimately systemic.
11209233	eng	It's a quiet day today.
11209234	eng	Today is a quiet day.
11209251	eng	He goes to our school.
11209252	eng	Tell me if Tom's in.
11209597	eng	The night has gone well.
11209615	eng	Ziri drove home on Thursday.
11209619	eng	Ziri set up his tent.
11209626	eng	Ziri is not welcome here.
11209633	eng	Ziri realized Rima was correct.
11209634	eng	Ziri didn't wear a uniform.
11209637	eng	Ziri retired to his tent.
11209644	eng	Ziri rolled his window up.
11209645	eng	Silence fell over the camp.
11209656	eng	Ziri was allowed to leave.
11209673	eng	Ziri and Rima exchanged stories.
11209676	eng	Ziri is your archetypal hillbilly.
11209688	eng	Ziri walked to the car.
11209692	eng	Ziri began packing his essentials.
11209700	eng	Ziri got it all wrong.
11209704	eng	Ziri got a new ID.
11209705	eng	Ziri knows who Rima is.
11209712	eng	Ziri sat in the back.
11209713	eng	Ziri was coming as well.
11209734	eng	Ziri decided to go camping.
11209763	eng	Ziri smiled, revealing dirty teeth.
11209770	eng	Ziri saw Rima standing up.
11209771	eng	Ziri caught up to Rima.
11209773	eng	Ziri had confidence in Rima.
11209780	eng	Ziri has brought his dog.
11209797	eng	Ziri was searching for something.
11209799	eng	Ziri saw who was there.
11209800	eng	Ziri has a colorful uniform.
11209806	eng	Ziri didn't see anyone around.
11209817	eng	Ziri crawled over to Rima.
11209818	eng	Ziri needed to go pee.
11209823	eng	Who was talking to Ziri?
11209829	eng	Ziri really loves the summertime.
11209831	eng	Ziri always goes camping alone.
11209834	eng	Ziri doesn't use a tent.
11209836	eng	It was already getting dark.
11209852	eng	Ziri peeked over the hill.

11209877	eng	Ziri listened for a while.
11209881	eng	Rima isn't wearing a nightgown.
11209952	eng	Pour some coffee for Tom.
11210045	eng	Ziri is hypocritical about this.

11210550	eng	This is my favorite bar.
11210602	eng	I encourage you to participate.
11210606	eng	I encouraged Tom to participate.

11220962	eng	Ziri checked his phone again.
11221007	eng	Something was wrong with me.
11221010	eng	The creature had no eyes.
11221011	eng	The creatures reached for me.
11221022	eng	Ziri was inside the bathroom.
11221024	eng	Ziri's mind went into overdrive.
11221027	eng	The wooden floor started shaking.
11221028	eng	Suddenly, Ziri heard a meow.
11221029	eng	Ziri scooped the cat up.
11221034	eng	Ziri scanned the room quickly.
11221038	eng	Ziri darted for the door.
11221039	eng	Ziri dove into the snow.
11221040	eng	Ziri struggled to wriggle free.
11221045	eng	The cat clung to Ziri.
11221056	eng	Ziri reached for his gun.
11221057	eng	Ziri recognized the park ranger.
11221072	eng	Ziri is safe and home.
11221081	eng	Ziri hasn't slept very well.
11221088	eng	The hyena was badly injured.
11221103	eng	Ziri shot at the gazelle.
11221112	eng	Ziri scanned his surroundings slowly.
11221114	eng	Ziri found a wounded gazelle.
11221115	eng	Ziri began smelling something awful.
11221117	eng	The decomposing flesh was stinking.
11221119	eng	Ziri called a game warden.
11221120	eng	Ziri radioed the game warden.
11221124	eng	Ziri passed between the trees.
11221125	eng	The bear was very large.
11221136	eng	This disease is very nasty.
11221137	eng	This gazelle is very dead.
11221140	eng	Nothing like that is real.
11221148	eng	Ziri had a nice trailer.
11221153	eng	Ziri walked for an hour.
11221159	eng	Ziri refrained from shouting out.
11221163	eng	The forest has gone silent.
11221191	eng	Ziri explained what he saw.
11221205	eng	Ziri claims that Bigfoot exists.
11221207	eng	Ziri knows that Bigfoot exists.
11221208	eng	Ziri captured footage of Bigfoot.
11221221	eng	We go up the tower.
11221512	eng	I go get my bag.
11221565	eng	You shouldn't blindly trust Tom.
11221859	eng	Tom did his work well.
11221864	eng	Many people left before noon.
11221865	eng	Tom lived here three years.
11221880	eng	Tom ran a race yesterday.
11221881	eng	You can't do the impossible.
11221904	eng	The program gets upgraded regularly.
11221982	eng	It wasn't real for Tom.
11222276	eng	I'm beginning to feel better.
11222577	eng	He phoned me at midnight.
11222578	eng	She phoned me at midnight.
11222579	eng	She rang me at midnight.
11222604	eng	Don't buy Tom anything sweet.
11222641	eng	Have I translated that correctly?
11222652	eng	Ziri is ruining my life.
11222655	eng	The whole place was dead.
11222659	eng	The place was absolutely trashed.
11222661	eng	Ziri sat on a log.
11222664	eng	Ziri was worshiping that statue.
11222675	eng	The forest went quiet again.
11222676	eng	Ziri contacted the rangers' office.
11222678	eng	Ziri fired off four bullets.
11222688	eng	Did you hear me singing?
11222700	eng	Ziri still had the camera.
11222706	eng	Ziri looked exactly like Walid.
11222762	eng	Ziri got the fire going.
11222769	eng	We've got loads of time.
11222784	eng	Ziri slept in his boots.
11222787	eng	Ziri sneaked up on Rima.
11222788	eng	The noise was far off.
11222796	eng	Ziri sprinted to his car.
11222833	eng	Ziri's camp is just there.
11222848	eng	Ziri checked the clearing out.
11222854	eng	Ziri sat by the campfire.
11222858	eng	Ziri started to do that.
11222868	eng	Ziri lives in northern Algeria.
11222874	eng	Ziri headed to the mountains.
11222876	eng	Ziri prepared everything he needed.
11222879	eng	War has returned to Europe.
11222885	eng	Ziri would wait for Rima.
11222905	eng	Ziri followed the trail down.
11222918	eng	The woods went dead silent.
11222920	eng	Ziri was a naive kid.
11222921	eng	Ziri started to get frightened.
11222922	eng	Ziri had to leave then.
11222926	eng	Ziri has finally gotten home.
11222932	eng	Ziri left from Bejaia, Algeria.
11222938	eng	Ziri returned to his tent.
11222941	eng	Ziri was finally getting tired.
11222946	eng	Ziri accidentally woke Rima up.
11222959	eng	Ziri can't really explain that.
11222961	eng	The noise became more intense.
11222965	eng	The hyena circled Ziri's tent.
11222977	eng	The train was overly crowded.
11222996	eng	Ziri traveled during the night.
11223001	eng	Ziri called for the dog.
11223013	eng	Ziri wanted to scare hikers.
11223019	eng	Ziri ran into the woods.
11223020	eng	The puppies were fussy again.
11223026	eng	Ziri looked at the fire.
11223041	eng	Ziri was with his dog.
11223045	eng	Ziri put out Rima's fire.
11223046	eng	Ziri lit himself a torch.
11223051	eng	Ziri is a first-time camper.
11223058	eng	The Tassili Park is massive.
11223061	eng	Ziri's truck has regular lights.
11223074	eng	Ziri stayed on the road.
11223083	eng	Ziri knew he hit something.
11223090	eng	Ziri followed the tracks further.
11223101	eng	Ziri got to his truck.
11223107	eng	Ziri slid under the truck.
11223126	eng	Ziri's hopes were dashed instantly.
11223135	eng	Ziri slipped off the edge.
11223136	eng	The xenomorph was inching closer.
11223137	eng	The hyena bared its teeth.
11223144	eng	The hyena sniffed at Ziri.
11223146	eng	Ziri is Rima's fellow ranger.
11223151	eng	Another park ranger stepped inside.
11223153	eng	Ziri pulled out his phone.
11223164	eng	Ziri stayed away from them.
11223172	eng	The gazelle isn't going anywhere.
11223180	eng	Ziri carried the dog out.
11223181	eng	Ziri talked to the campers.
11223186	eng	The gazelle was already injured.
11223192	eng	The jackal killed the gazelle.
11223196	eng	Ziri heard a car start.
11223213	eng	Ziri found blood all over.
11223214	eng	Ziri showed Rima the door.
11223215	eng	The blue door slid open.
11223221	eng	Ziri broke into vacation houses.
11223227	eng	It's just kids being kids.
11223234	eng	People wanted their money back.
11223237	eng	Ziri was in a bodybag.
11223245	eng	Ziri was under the water.
11223250	eng	Something was pulling Ziri down.
11223254	eng	Ziri had to find out.
11223255	eng	Ziri rented some diving equipment.
11223264	eng	The trail was barely visible.
11223266	eng	Ziri swam to the side.
11223271	eng	Ziri came here every weekend.
11223281	eng	Ziri stared at the picture.
11223300	eng	The robbers became less cautious.
11223307	eng	Ziri was wearing a wetsuit.
11223309	eng	Ziri stopped feeding the fish.
11223314	eng	Ziri chose the fourth option.
11223323	eng	Ziri stared into Rima's face.
11223348	eng	Give them back to him.
11223349	eng	All we do is lie.
11223353	eng	This is my grandparents' house.
11223460	eng	How did Tom recognise you?
11223464	eng	Tom did them the same.
11223683	eng	We will celebrate with Tom.
11223697	eng	Most towns have an airport.
11223930	eng	How do we open this?
11223933	eng	Tom usually jogs before breakfast.
11223944	eng	It's a big step backward.
11223951	eng	Tom looked at Mary blankly.
11223955	eng	Tom looked up in surprise.
11223956	eng	I'm really worried about it.
11223957	eng	I'm really worried about this.
11224098	eng	We went there with Tom.
11224104	eng	You need to tell Tom.
11224105	eng	Who would vote for Tom?
11224106	eng	You ought to tell Tom.
11224543	eng	Ziri loves the great outdoors.
11224550	eng	Ziri listens to Rima's podcasts.
11224551	eng	Ziri is a story narrator.
11224557	eng	Ziri tried not to panic.
11224567	eng	Ziri listened for a bit.
11224570	eng	The sound got so annoying.
11224571	eng	Ziri talked about Tuareg lore.
11224572	eng	These are traditional Tuareg lands.
11224579	eng	The water has become undrinkable.
11224580	eng	Ziri went out to smoke.
11224590	eng	Ziri won't know the truth.
11224591	eng	Ziri doesn't work here anymore.
11224593	eng	Ziri didn't want to pay.
11224596	eng	Ziri took a detour instead.
11224597	eng	Ziri visited that famous forest.
11224599	eng	A fuse must have blown.
11224601	eng	Ziri slammed the hood shut.
11224602	eng	It was a foggy night.
11224603	eng	It was an idiotic idea.
11224609	eng	Ziri's engine was still on.
11224610	eng	Ziri felt surrounded and trapped.
11224614	eng	Ziri was interviewed on TV.
11224619	eng	Ziri checked over his car.
11224635	eng	Ziri's camera was going bad.
11224636	eng	Ziri purchased a new camera.
11224646	eng	Ziri didn't make a move.
11224649	eng	Ziri walked around the tree.
11224663	eng	Ziri walked into the woods.
11224682	eng	Ziri was in a tree.
11224684	eng	Ziri was running full sprint.
11224694	eng	Ziri entered the rifle range.
11224699	eng	The place has become shabby.
11224706	eng	Ziri ran around the corner.
11224710	eng	Ziri was in full-on sprint.
11224715	eng	Ziri was pushing Rima forward.
11224723	eng	What killed all those gazelles?
11224729	eng	Ziri began hiking in Chrea.
11224742	eng	Ziri started thinking about that.
11224747	eng	Ziri heard a crying dog.
11224766	eng	Ziri immediately got back up.
11224770	eng	Panicking would make everything worse.
11224771	eng	Ziri was cursing and groaning.
11224809	eng	Ziri went to the cabin.
11224819	eng	Ziri was covered in blood.
11224832	eng	Ziri's mom hugged him tightly.
11224845	eng	Ziri was sipping his tea.
11224851	eng	Ziri put his cup down.
11224856	eng	Ziri walked towards the lake.
11224864	eng	Ziri was sitting dead still.
11224869	eng	Ziri collapsed onto the couch.
11224917	eng	Ziri tries to help people.
11224929	eng	Ziri tried to surprise Rima.
11224935	eng	The search ended on Thursday.
11224936	eng	Ziri began to resent Rima.
11224939	eng	Ziri kept searching for Rima.
11224949	eng	Ziri has finally found Rima.
11224953	eng	Ziri pulled the trigger slowly.
11224958	eng	Ziri was frozen in fear.
11224969	eng	The creature had baboon-like canines.
11224970	eng	Is Bigfoot an endangered species?
11225131	eng	So, why did you say?
11225418	eng	Maybe it's just my imagination.
11225581	eng	It can still be fixed.
11225582	eng	It can still be repaired.
11226110	eng	I've scheduled for the week-end.
11226340	eng	Go to the front building.
11226766	eng	Contentment is better than gold.
11226767	eng	Tom went instead of me.
11226768	eng	We visited our mother's grave.
11226771	eng	Tom was about to leave.
11226787	eng	Tom stood there, saying nothing.
11226873	eng	I want to play tennis.
11227030	eng	Tom is a widower now.
11227031	eng	Tom is now a widower.
11227386	eng	Why can't I be you?
11227399	eng	Tom is likely to agree.
11227414	eng	Tom had nowhere to hide.
11227432	eng	Ziri was an uncaring homeowner.
11227436	eng	The street lights were on.
11227446	eng	Ziri's house has a fence.
11227447	eng	The cabin had a fence.
11227454	eng	Ziri kept the dog outside.
11227455	eng	Ziri doesn't like dogs inside.
11227458	eng	Ziri's dog killed Rima's chickens.
11227478	eng	Ziri's dog was prancing around.
11227496	eng	Ziri was facing the building.
11227504	eng	The other room lit up.
11227507	eng	Ziri thought it was hilarious.
11227508	eng	Ziri didn't move at all.
11227517	eng	Suddenly, the room lit up.
11227529	eng	It feels bizarre down there.
11227533	eng	Ziri brought some comic books.
11227545	eng	Ziri got edgy and irritable.
11227548	eng	Ziri felt uneasy and unwelcome.
11227550	eng	Ziri doesn't really remember correctly.
11227560	eng	Ziri was almost in tears.
11227565	eng	Ziri doesn't feel welcome there.
11227573	eng	Ziri is an avid angler.
11227580	eng	Four hours have already passed.
11227581	eng	Ziri was hiking back home.
11227588	eng	The gazelle came near Ziri.
11227590	eng	There was no more splashing.
11227607	eng	Ziri saw something following him.
11227609	eng	Ziri swore like a sailor.
11227611	eng	I have a leaky tap.
11227614	eng	I've got a leaky tap.
11227620	eng	Ziri decided to go independently.
11227622	eng	This is a huge no-no.
11227634	eng	She's getting into the lift.
11227636	eng	She's going into the lift.
11227649	eng	I warned him several times.
11227651	eng	I've warned him several times.
11227659	eng	I'll try to persuade him.
11227663	eng	Ziri was talking about cryptids.
11227667	eng	He's behind with his payments.
11227669	eng	Ziri felt very creeped out.
11227683	eng	Must I do everything myself?
11227696	eng	The canopy was so dense.
11227698	eng	Those are not my words.
11227703	eng	Ziri was driving very slowly.
11227724	eng	Ziri walked down the trail.
11227727	eng	Ziri was still not back.
11227728	eng	Ziri is an experienced hunter.
11227730	eng	That's prime time for hunting.
11227732	eng	It could be Ziri's dad.
11227736	eng	Ziri wanted Rima back instantly.
11227743	eng	Ziri never went hunting again.
11227747	eng	Ziri wasn't trained in anything.
11227751	eng	Ziri was afraid of leopards.
11227752	eng	Ziri was outside the tent.
11227756	eng	This sounds a little cliche.
11227769	eng	Ziri wrote in his journal.
11227777	eng	Ziri slept in boisterous places.
11227782	eng	Be careful in the woods.
11227790	eng	Ziri should turn around now.
11227793	eng	The feeling was gone entirely.
11227795	eng	Ziri followed a small creek.
11227800	eng	Ziri started running in fear.
11227806	eng	What's that behind the tree?
11227808	eng	Ziri lives in rural Algeria.
11227833	eng	The gazelle was eerily frozen.
11227838	eng	Ziri spooked himself over nothing.
11227844	eng	The figure has now vanished.
11227855	eng	The noises behind me stopped.
11227862	eng	The Yautja can move quickly.
11227868	eng	Ziri didn't see any gazelle.
11227874	eng	The creature had black fur.
11227878	eng	The hyena crossed the creek.
11227879	eng	Ziri heard a howl, too.
11227917	eng	Ziri started building a campfire.
11227925	eng	The creature moved farther away.
11227929	eng	Ziri soon went to sleep.
11227932	eng	Ziri zipped open his tent.
11227943	eng	Ziri blamed that on alcohol.
11227944	eng	Ziri's life returned to normal.
11227955	eng	Ziri needs to think rationally.
11227964	eng	Ziri went for the car.
11227965	eng	Ziri walked past the car.
11227971	eng	Ziri hates rest areas now.
11228090	eng	The gnome returned at night.
11228149	eng	Did you propose to her?
11228150	eng	Have you proposed to her?
11228169	eng	He left you a note.
11228170	eng	Just say I want you!
11228178	eng	Just say I want it.
11228180	eng	Just say I want her!
11228250	eng	He died in his cell.
11228328	eng	My father lives next door.
11228712	eng	Don't drink too much beer.
11228833	eng	Give me some instructions, please.
11228903	eng	She suspected him of cheating.
11228920	eng	She was a beautiful woman.
11229103	eng	Tom is out of petrol.
11229105	eng	Tom is out of gas.
11229118	eng	Give me your credit card.
11229119	eng	What's your credit card number?
11229131	eng	Tom promised he would change.
11229230	eng	Tom's writing is very legible.
11229231	eng	Tom's handwriting is very legible.
11229235	eng	Stop pretending to be asleep.
11229363	eng	See you the year after!
11229424	eng	Tom didn't invite me in.
11229428	eng	We close at five o'clock.
11229432	eng	Tom is on edge today.
11229440	eng	Let Tom in at once.
11229441	eng	Let Tom in right away.
11229443	eng	Mary is a shy girl.
11229444	eng	Tom called in sick yesterday.
11229445	eng	Tom is a real peach.
11229451	eng	Your reaction is surprisingly childish.
11229470	eng	Tom's hearing isn't very good.
11229471	eng	Hold on to me tight.
11229475	eng	I don't like dining alone.
11229486	eng	Tom hurt his left foot.
11229726	eng	She went back to Africa.
11229739	eng	He wrote them a letter.
11229764	eng	I try to be polite.
11229767	eng	About two hours went by.
11229769	eng	It's been about two hours.
11229771	eng	Our society is falling apart.
11229774	eng	That's nothing to joke about.
11229781	eng	Our country is in shambles.
11229808	eng	I love grandma and grandpa.
11229843	eng	I am to your left.
11230452	eng	I can't stand my neighbors.
11230462	eng	Please pardon my poor penmanship.
11230496	eng	Tom has already been forgiven.
11230536	eng	I had a good laugh.
11230573	eng	I was ten minutes late.
11230577	eng	Can I leave it here?
11230797	eng	She's not one to lie.
11230800	eng	I finally got a job!
11230857	eng	Mary dropped out of school.
11230959	eng	It is the first lesson.
11230983	eng	Help people if you can.
11231039	eng	His instructions were not good.
11231102	eng	He is embarrassed to ask.
11231368	eng	Tom is organizing this event.
11231427	eng	Some of you may die.
11231443	eng	Ziri chose to ignore Rima.
11231451	eng	A fence surrounded the forest.
11231479	eng	Ziri took a longer route.
11231482	eng	Ziri walked towards the treeline.
11231486	eng	Ziri heard a different sound.

11231559	eng	The creature's limbs were twisted.
11231560	eng	The creature had rotting skin.

11231659	eng	The trail is always there.
11231674	eng	It was quickly getting dark.
11231678	eng	Ziri saw the bike headlight.
11231681	eng	Ziri disappeared into the darkness.
11231706	eng	The fire consumed Ziri's truck.

11231766	eng	A little exercise never hurts.

11231777	eng	Ziri jerked his hand away.
11231830	eng	Have you got any cash?
11231864	eng	Mary got angry with me.

11232055	eng	The food was not there.
11232056	eng	A leopard entered out campsite.

11232250	eng	Ziri's light illuminated Rima's face.
11232339	eng	This text is worth translating.
11232343	eng	Where do your kids live?
11232400	eng	I take my bath singing.
11232946	eng	This is a children's song.

11233309	eng	Did anyone see it fall?
11233326	eng	He considers him a friend.
11233375	eng	She answered us speaking English.
11233588	eng	Ziri immersed himself in nature.
11233595	eng	Those rumors are a fallacy.
11233596	eng	The buck's antlers were sharp.
11233602	eng	Ziri kept his doors locked.
11233615	eng	Ziri turned and saw Rima.
11233635	eng	Ziri wanted to document that.
11233638	eng	Why weren't the gazelles there?

11235061	eng	Does he sell mineral water?
11235108	eng	As the old saying goes.
11235216	eng	Petrol prices have come down.
11235217	eng	The wound must be stitched.
11235225	eng	He enlisted as a volunteer.
11235233	eng	So, who is your dad?
11235238	eng	There are no further warnings.

11235394	eng	Has that been proved scientifically?
11235403	eng	Where's the nearest lost property?

11235693	eng	Ziri hiked that park often.
11235716	eng	Ziri can still see Rima.

11235748	eng	Ziri kept walking straight ahead.
11235750	eng	Ziri walked nervously towards Rima.
11235754	eng	Ziri said nothing to Rima.
11235769	eng	Ziri turned the flashlight on.
11235772	eng	Ziri didn't make much sound.
11235790	eng	Ziri heard a demonic voice.
11235793	eng	The smell was unbearably intense.

11235850	eng	Ziri has not done anything.
11235852	eng	Walking there is always tranquil.
11235866	eng	The service was very weak.
11235891	eng	Ziri didn't smell that smell.
11235991	eng	Please, I didn't do anything!
11236388	eng	You can't lie to yourself.

11236445	eng	How big is your bed?
11236447	eng	I'll close the door, okay?
11236459	eng	I'll stick to my principles.
11236503	eng	Who's paying for the wedding?

11237130	eng	Visibility was close to nothing.
11237133	eng	It was a woman's voice.
11237142	eng	Ziri froze in place again.
11237145	eng	Ziri was saying soothing words.
11237149	eng	Ziri died in that schoolyard.

11237443	eng	Which hospital is he in?
11237461	eng	They exist to this day.
11237485	eng	This isn't your first warning.
11237516	eng	I'm not dying for them.
11237518	eng	What the shit was that?

11238470	eng	By "here" I meant Australia.
11238471	eng	Let's smoke a bowl first.
11238897	eng	I drive my own car.
11238911	eng	I almost died of boredom.
11238994	eng	Ziri pushed through the jungle.
11238996	eng	The dog saved Ziri's life.
11239005	eng	Ziri wanted that to stop.

11239199	eng	The dead man was moving.
11239200	eng	The snake began to slither.
11239204	eng	Things couldn't get anymore insane.
11239211	eng	That wasn't a happy smile.
11239241	eng	Ziri can't run very fast.
11239247	eng	Ziri was in the dirt.
11239252	eng	Ziri delivered the killer blow.
11239260	eng	Ziri must live with that.
11239262	eng	Ziri apologized to his editor.
11239277	eng	Ziri's chest got all tight.

11239384	eng	Ziri fell and got injured.
11239391	eng	Ziri works in a forest.
11239398	eng	Ziri was screaming Rima's name.
11239411	eng	Ziri hiked almost every day.
11239418	eng	Ziri must be getting old.
11239419	eng	Ziri can't find the trail.

11239461	eng	Ziri's dog is trained well.
11239463	eng	Ziri's dog followed the scent.

11239484	eng	Ziri has become so disoriented.
11239491	eng	Ziri laid next to Rima.
11239492	eng	The bone hit the floor.
11239493	eng	This filled me with dread.

11239574	eng	As we live we learn.
11239637	eng	You can leave a review.
11239639	eng	Do you like cranberry juice?
11239640	eng	I bought unsweetened cranberry juice.
11239659	eng	It's not regulated by law.
11239666	eng	I've never filed a lawsuit.
11239668	eng	She looked at him, smiling.

11239774	eng	Ziri felt his body drop.
11239775	eng	Ziri was dazed and confused.

11239814	eng	The hyena got far away.
11239815	eng	Ziri carefully retrieved the map.
11239819	eng	Ziri did have a knife.
11239827	eng	Ziri's fall alerted the creature.
11239832	eng	Ziri needed to move forward.
11239856	eng	Ziri found an open cavern.

11241312	eng	Ziri's phone completely lost service.
11241319	eng	Ziri heard his dog growl.
11241336	eng	Ziri is watching scary movies.
11241337	eng	Ziri drove up that mountain.
11241339	eng	This always has me frightened.
11241343	eng	Ziri is not paying attention.
11241346	eng	Rima stared at her boyfriend.
11241352	eng	Windigos can mimic human voices.
11241359	eng	Those stories originate from Algeria.
11241370	eng	Ziri can continue his hike.
11241396	eng	Ziri was so well equipped.
11241413	eng	Ziri helped Rima make dinner.
11241429	eng	Ziri heard the sound clearly.
11241433	eng	Ziri was watching some cartoons.
11241438	eng	Ziri walked to the bathroom.
11241452	eng	Ziri almost soiled his pants.
11241453	eng	Ziri heard some animal digging.
11241460	eng	Ziri took several steps backwards.
11241495	eng	Tom speaks Peggy Hill Spanish.
11241516	eng	Is this a literal translation?
11241531	eng	Where did she find it?
11241535	eng	Where did she find you?
11241606	eng	What do the people want?
11241690	eng	He's too young for me.
11241701	eng	We must respect the elderly.
11241885	eng	Jews have no central authority.
11241889	eng	They burned centenary olive trees.
11242132	eng	The audience didn't like it.
11242228	eng	Ask her to come immediately.
11242745	eng	This is my neighbor's pet.
11242780	eng	I had a true friend.
11242832	eng	You are a wonderful person!
11243085	eng	Which city should we visit?
11243136	eng	How do you see me?
11243144	eng	I leave in one week.
11243354	eng	Youth has its own culture.
11243634	eng	Give me a beer please!
11243698	eng	Just take what you need.
11243987	eng	Put less parsley on it.
11243988	eng	Put more salt on it.
11243996	eng	Voters waited in endless lines.
11244002	eng	Be a bit more patient.
11244021	eng	They're too tired to work.
11244140	eng	Please lend me the car.
11244533	eng	Isn't Tom in your class?
11244546	eng	Everyone was scared except me.
11244563	eng	I can't express myself well.
11244669	eng	The laptop really became cheap.
11244762	eng	Ziri always heard those noises.
11244763	eng	Ziri headed into the woods.
11244767	eng	Ziri heard crunches and snaps.
11244769	eng	Someone or something got closer.
11244772	eng	Ziri started looking at Rima.
11244790	eng	The creature had black skin.
11244796	eng	Ziri came to the door.
11244800	eng	Ziri could not see anything.
11244803	eng	Ziri did believe Rima though.
11244810	eng	Ziri called the sheriff's station.
11244820	eng	Ziri heard an unnatural sound.
11244823	eng	Ziri was forty meters away.
11244833	eng	Ziri was stronger than Rima.
11244838	eng	Ziri crossed the street twice.
11244851	eng	Ziri stepped outside the cabin.
11244855	eng	Ziri got back to town.
11244869	eng	It could be a hyena.
11244871	eng	Ziri was incredibly freaked out.
11244874	eng	Ziri ran down the hill.
11244891	eng	The area was incredibly eerie.
11244895	eng	Ziri tossed the bones aside.
11244900	eng	Ziri gazed at the doll.
11244905	eng	Ziri tried not to laugh.
11244907	eng	Ziri stared back at Rima.
11244910	eng	Ziri didn't see anything ahead.
11244916	eng	The kayak struck a tree.
11244927	eng	Ziri's room was a mess.
11244933	eng	Ziri fell asleep rather quickly.
11244956	eng	Ziri walked towards the river.
11244971	eng	Ziri went into the ditch.
11244974	eng	Ziri hid in the ditch.
11244975	eng	Ziri forgot all about it.

11244978	eng	Ziri was taking some pictures.
11244981	eng	All the birds are gone.
11244982	eng	All the bugs are dead.
11244990	eng	Ziri walked to his room.
11244993	eng	Ziri heard the music playing.
11244995	eng	Ziri was wearing denim pants.
11244998	eng	Ziri went into the elevator.
11245029	eng	Now, allow me to elaborate.
11245041	eng	Ziri's organs were perfectly fine.
11245044	eng	Ziri's hair was completely gray.
11245047	eng	Ziri had to work late.
11245062	eng	Ziri stared around the station.
11245063	eng	Ziri wasn't in the water.
11245079	eng	Ziri was a major skeptic.
11245080	eng	Why isn't Ziri's story true?
11245086	eng	Ziri too took that seriously.
11245090	eng	Ziri's story wasn't that interesting.
11245091	eng	The investigation led to nothing.
11245094	eng	Ziri wasn't able to help.
11245096	eng	The station is well equipped.
11245116	eng	Ziri heard a woman's voice.
11245142	eng	Tom lives with his girlfriend.
11245145	eng	Tom lives with his friends.
11245171	eng	Ziri began to cry himself.
11245173	eng	The baby didn't stop crying.
11245175	eng	Ziri vanished before Rima's eyes.
11245181	eng	Ziri has no logical explanation.
11245182	eng	Ziri does believe in ghosts.
11245185	eng	Ziri's story sounds super conspiratorial.
11245198	eng	The light was very bright.
11245220	eng	Ziri doesn't trust the government.
11245228	eng	Ziri liked to camp there.
11245236	eng	Ziri left with the campers.
11245237	eng	Ziri left back for something.
11245248	eng	Ziri is a matter-of-fact guy.
11245366	eng	My mouse ate a cat.
11245367	eng	A cat ate my mouse.
11245411	eng	Ladies and gentlemen, good evening!
11245446	eng	Tom enticed them with promises.
11245465	eng	This is an ancient monastery.
11245480	eng	Ziri never had a dog.
11245577	eng	Rochel goes to my shul.

11245828	eng	Moshe is a Sephardic Jew.
11245988	eng	She should have kept quiet.
11246101	eng	The room filled with smoke.
11246133	eng	She was having a nightmare.
11246241	eng	Wait until he gets back.
11246242	eng	Wait till he gets back.
11246340	eng	She no longer lives here.
11246347	eng	Who wrote this writer's biography?
11246635	eng	I have to confess something.
11246637	eng	I love pineapple on pizza.
11246884	eng	Love is not talking nonsense.
11246940	eng	This man keeps talking nonsense.
11246953	eng	He made us feel sick.
11247109	eng	Ziri went missing late April.
11247113	eng	Ziri was patrolling the area.
11247133	eng	Ziri was startled at first.
11247139	eng	Ziri ran towards his truck.
11247148	eng	Ziri was patrolling the park.
11247155	eng	The hyena was rather large.
11247175	eng	Ziri lowered his tranquilizer gun.
11247180	eng	Ziri regrouped with his team.
11247181	eng	Ziri was training new rangers.
11247190	eng	Ziri kept the area clean.
11247213	eng	Ziri had a rough morning.
11247221	eng	Ziri continued following the tracks.
11247234	eng	It was raining and muddy.
11247240	eng	Ziri looked about Rima's age.
11247264	eng	Confused, Ziri kept looking around.
11247265	eng	Ziri saw a tree swaying.
11247268	eng	Ziri never truly understood that.
11247282	eng	When were the Americas populated?
11247291	eng	Guantanamo is a ruthless place.
11247292	eng	Guantanamo is a brutal place.
11247294	eng	Cells in Guantanamo are tiny.
11247489	eng	I bought Tom a coffee.
11247509	eng	Germanic languages are so beautiful.
11247532	eng	Orange juice is drunk fresh.
11247657	eng	You said it, not me.
11247658	eng	"Meow!" "Dang heckin' right, Cookie!"
11247733	eng	Those guys are such crybullies.
11247743	eng	The cat followed the mouse.
11247753	eng	They're canvassing for the governor.
11247761	eng	His presence cheapened the event.
11247793	eng	What are we playing for?
11247878	eng	I love all my aunts.
11248056	eng	I speak the Kabyle language.
11248082	eng	Why don't you speak Kabyle?
11248122	eng	Good friends are never lost.
11248330	eng	People liked what he did.
11248336	eng	How are woolen clothes washed?
11248435	eng	This is a satirical story.
11249093	eng	Ziri is still here today.
11249095	eng	Ziri watched over the park.
11249118	eng	Ziri started to breathe better.
11249128	eng	Ziri is much too young.
11249132	eng	Ziri was eating lunch there.
11249137	eng	Ziri has a little boy.
11249152	eng	Things aren't what they were.
11249164	eng	Snorkeling is a fun sport.
11249169	eng	Ziri is a scuba diver.
11249175	eng	Ziri kept his eyes closed.
11249189	eng	Leave the top button undone.
11249208	eng	I'm tired, hungry and thirsty.
11249223	eng	Did the cameras catch it?
11249230	eng	You can't just stay away.
11249233	eng	He fell into the abyss.
11249234	eng	These kids are twin brothers.
11249292	eng	These letters cannot be read.
11249300	eng	Ziri is a friendly guy.
11249302	eng	Ziri works in the area.
11249306	eng	The voice sounded quite real.
11249308	eng	Ziri left the area early.
11249318	eng	Ziri wasn't new to this.
11249319	eng	Ziri visited the cave alone.
11249331	eng	Ziri heard his nephew's voice.
11249334	eng	The voices simply stopped altogether.
11249358	eng	May Ziri rest in peace.
11249369	eng	Ziri has to get back.
11249376	eng	Ziri calmly called the police.
11249382	eng	Ziri finally went to bed.
11249390	eng	Ziri kept his gun nearby.
11249395	eng	Ziri got his car towed.
11249396	eng	Ziri got his car fixed.
11249406	eng	This made Ziri on edge.
11249408	eng	Things grew quiet... too quiet.
11249410	eng	Ziri headed towards the voice.
11249411	eng	The voice sounded more distorted.
11249431	eng	Ziri believes Rima is dead.
11249440	eng	It suddenly began to snow.
11249446	eng	Ziri still couldn't get anywhere.
11249458	eng	Soon after, the hyena left.
11249461	eng	Ziri didn't survive the night.
11249463	eng	Ziri couldn't feel his toes.
11249472	eng	I have to be hallucinating.
11249475	eng	Ziri doesn't run the fastest.
11249489	eng	It got dark stupid early.
11249493	eng	Ziri was wrapping things up.
11249500	eng	Ziri peed himself in fear.
11249504	eng	Ziri very slowly backed away.
11249521	eng	Ziri fell on his butt.
11249522	eng	Ziri struggled to get up.
11249523	eng	Ziri's head hit the tree.
11249528	eng	The hyena didn't give pursuit.
11249530	eng	Ziri peed himself a bit.
11249539	eng	Ziri was leaving the station.
11249642	eng	The coffee was very hot.
11249829	eng	A woman lost her son.
11249831	eng	She cries days and nights.
11249845	eng	Was it written by you?
11250483	eng	Not my cup of tea.
11250662	eng	Don't start with that again.
11250779	eng	They don't give a fuck.
11250995	eng	Children depend on their parents.
11251110	eng	Who's that next to Tom?
11251212	eng	I died from emotional damage.
11251324	eng	Some people just won't listen.
11251332	eng	The jackal started approaching Ziri.
11251334	eng	Ziri didn't touch the dog.
11251341	eng	Ziri was a new recruit.
11251347	eng	The monster swallowed Ziri whole.
11251348	eng	Ziri finished telling the story.
11251354	eng	Ziri was granted the permission.
11251371	eng	Ziri had a horrible headache.
11251375	eng	Berber isn't Ziri's first language.
11251376	eng	Ziri felt a bit dizzy.
11251377	eng	Ziri sat under a tree.
11251378	eng	Actually, Ziri has no idea.
11251381	eng	Ziri fell into a coma.
11251392	eng	Absolutely do not turn around.
11251393	eng	Ziri shouldn't look behind him.
11251397	eng	Not many visitors go there.
11251401	eng	The voice called Ziri's name.
11251403	eng	The voice continued calling Ziri.
11251414	eng	Ziri lied about his name.
11251419	eng	There are no benches available.
11251425	eng	It didn't always make sense.
11251428	eng	Ziri stared in Rima's direction.
11251442	eng	Ziri got bored by that.
11251451	eng	Ziri died because of that.
11251452	eng	Ziri faced a horrible ending.
11251460	eng	Make sure you are safe.
11251465	eng	Ziri likes to pet dogs.
11251484	eng	Ziri ran away in terror.
11251486	eng	Ziri lost sight of Rima.
11251501	eng	Ziri started blurting out questions.
11251514	eng	Ziri rescued Rima from death.
11251530	eng	They don't share information easily.
11251533	eng	Be careful not getting caught.
11251535	eng	We didn't build that bridge.
11251536	eng	The bridge is not safe.
11251542	eng	I feel dizzy right now.
11251550	eng	Ziri hopes Rima is alright.
11251557	eng	Ziri comes here to jog.
11251563	eng	Ziri sped out of there.
11251581	eng	Ziri happened to be nearby.
11251600	eng	Ziri was listening to music.
11251601	eng	Ziri scared the birds away.
11251602	eng	Ziri tried talking to Rima.
11251612	eng	Ziri was very badly hurt.
11251619	eng	Ziri's eyes were wide open.
11251625	eng	Sometimes, we need time alone.
11251626	eng	Ziri gave his colleagues walkie-talkies.
11251630	eng	Ziri walked quite a lot.
11251632	eng	Ziri went sitting with Rima.
11251633	eng	Ziri asked for Rima's name.
11251637	eng	Ziri acts like a sociopath.
11251641	eng	Let's just change the subject.
11251772	eng	Everything was in excellent condition.
11251801	eng	We had too little time.
11251825	eng	How many shots were fired?
11252135	eng	Many children fear their parents.
11252136	eng	This is an interesting discussion.
11252146	eng	I remember how it started.
11252468	eng	Please engage brain before speaking.
11252488	eng	She's not alone any more.
11252536	eng	I'm sick as a dog.
11252543	eng	You're still angry, aren't you?
11252554	eng	What do you want again?
11252778	eng	I hid under the desk.
11252796	eng	I don't edit your articles.
11252840	eng	I'll give her my hand.
11252849	eng	We worry about the future.
11252876	eng	Ziri entered the wooden cabin.
11252881	eng	Rima's blue eyes were mesmerizing.
11252890	eng	Ziri regained all his consciousness.
11252896	eng	Ziri's head hurts a lot.
11252899	eng	Ziri worked in other parks.
11252917	eng	Ziri has his own phobias.
11252919	eng	Ziri shouldn't show his weakness.
11252930	eng	Ziri knew he heard footsteps.
11252932	eng	Ziri didn't receive any answer.
11252936	eng	Ziri heard Rima go away.
11252970	eng	Ziri asked around about Rima.
11252972	eng	Ziri had very long legs.
11252983	eng	Ziri tried changing the subject.
11252993	eng	Ziri likes reading Rima's blog.
11253001	eng	Ziri didn't upload anything today.
11253005	eng	Ziri told us something new.
11253011	eng	Ziri turned to his left.
11253016	eng	Ziri had light brown hair.
11253019	eng	This confused Ziri a lot.
11253025	eng	Ziri ran quickly towards Rima.
11253028	eng	Ziri turned pale as paper.
11253037	eng	Ziri couldn't have done otherwise.
11253053	eng	Ziri got lost at night.
11253066	eng	Why did Ziri warn Rima?
11253073	eng	Ziri really hates being alone.
11253079	eng	Ziri went to work anyways.
11253085	eng	Ziri started narrating what happened.
11253088	eng	Ziri sounds like a lunatic.
11253090	eng	Ziri died on the impact.
11253099	eng	Ziri reluctantly accepted the gift.
11253111	eng	Ziri doesn't like that idea.
11253114	eng	Ziri wasn't talkative at all.
11253128	eng	Ziri can read Rima's mind.
11253145	eng	Ziri took off his sunglasses.
11253148	eng	Ziri answered the last question.
11253154	eng	After all, silence is gold.
11253165	eng	All the rangers should leave.
11253166	eng	Ziri just can't risk it.
11253172	eng	Ziri is done working here.
11253175	eng	Ziri blames himself for that.
11253188	eng	Suicide is hard to commit.
11253191	eng	Ziri didn't even really notice.
11253204	eng	Ziri would have killed Rima.
11253206	eng	Ziri doesn't even understand that.
11253207	eng	Ziri felt his heart jump.
11253210	eng	Ziri didn't even seem surprised.
11253213	eng	Life is not fair sometimes.
11253216	eng	Ziri made Rima even angrier.
11253219	eng	Ziri was there for Rima.
11253220	eng	Ziri will keep his promises.
11253221	eng	Ziri will help Rima heal.
11253222	eng	Ziri was still there, smoking.
11253323	eng	The dolphins swim with us.
11253702	eng	The oil comes from olives.
11254231	eng	Many doctors have been sick.
11254236	eng	Will you tuck me in?
11254350	eng	Can this gas be liquefied?
11254357	eng	What happens if I refuse?
11254389	eng	I've got what you need.
11254395	eng	I'm recovering from my illness.
11254454	eng	Do you like that person?
11254463	eng	Pomegranate trees have slender leaves.
11254578	eng	Ziri flipped everything back on.
11254596	eng	Ziri followed a dried-mud trail.
11254597	eng	Ziri turned off his walkman.
11254603	eng	Ziri opened his eyes again.
11254616	eng	Ziri had a single-bedroom home.
11254626	eng	Ziri lived a humble life.
11254638	eng	Ziri replied with a smile.
11254644	eng	Have you cleaned the stove?
11254646	eng	The moon was incredibly bright.
11254656	eng	Ziri brought Rima with him.
11254661	eng	Ziri went outside to check.
11254666	eng	Ziri screamed at the screen.
11254669	eng	Ziri will soon see why.

11254700	eng	Ziri wanted to hear more.
11254703	eng	Ziri wasn't scared of anything.

11254738	eng	Ziri is now my brother-in-law.
11254743	eng	What happened out there tonight?

11254806	eng	It happened late one night.
11254807	eng	The ranger station called in.
11254819	eng	The creature's feet were hoofed.
11254826	eng	Ziri lied to the rangers.

11254884	eng	Ziri left without a trace.
11254890	eng	Ziri came along with Rima.
11254891	eng	Ziri never got scared easily.

11255061	eng	The blood was attracting flies.
11255072	eng	Ziri entered the pine thicket.
11255080	eng	The hyena was absolutely gone.
11255093	eng	It's too dark out here.
11255094	eng	It's too dark down here.
11255098	eng	Ziri could see no one.
11255104	eng	Ziri's dogs tracked the fox.
11255140	eng	The creature had hollow eyes.
11255162	eng	None of that matters now.
11255186	eng	Ziri was loading his weapon.
11255189	eng	Ziri heard footsteps following him.

11628704	eng	"Where is everyone?" "At church."
11628705	eng	Gunter might convert to Islam.

11645715	eng	Leon was directly behind Amelia.
11645721	eng	Did you open a window?
11645722	eng	The row was completely empty.
11645725	eng	Leon was on his knees.

11671283	eng	I see Tom every week.
11671308	eng	She's as tall as Tom.
11671328	eng	I paid homage to him.
11671329	eng	I paid tribute to her.
11671349	eng	What she's saying isn't true.

11671607	eng	I find him pretty funny.
11671952	eng	He has grandchildren and great-grandchildren.
11671979	eng	I love cuddling with you.
11672081	eng	It all seems so absurd!
11672150	eng	I can lend you mine.
11672151	eng	How are they any better?
11672349	eng	Heroes arise in troubled times.
11672358	eng	I'm a fully healthy person.
11672640	eng	Do you consider yourself patriotic?
11672681	eng	Who knows who is who?
11673161	eng	Tobias wanted to go exploring.
11673167	eng	The window was too high.
11673169	eng	Tobias had his way in.
11673171	eng	Tobias squeezed into the hole.

11673344	eng	Tobias fired a warning shot.
11673373	eng	Tobias was holding a machete.
11673393	eng	Alberto didn't have plans anyways.

11673416	eng	Alberto was home on Halloween.
11673420	eng	It's not worth my time.
11673423	eng	Alberto was playing his PS4.

11673729	eng	"Police!" "Up here! Up here!"

11675808	eng	Alberto tried the door handle.
11675813	eng	Alberto felt the temperature drop.
11675814	eng	The guard shooed Alberto away.

11675959	eng	Alberto wanted to be funny.
11675961	eng	We all started to laugh.
11675970	eng	Alberto went upstairs to check.

11676029	eng	Alberto painted Isabella a portrait.
11676090	eng	She reminds me my dad.

11676529	eng	Can you locate this town?
11676553	eng	I've never seen you here.
11676554	eng	Sing us a little song.

11694443	eng	Damiano is the ship’s captain.
11694458	eng	Damiano was unable to escape.
11694461	eng	Damiano walked on broken glass.

11694475	eng	Damiano can access Isabella's PC.
11694483	eng	Damiano looked outside the window.

11694546	eng	Enrico held Rima at gunpoint.
11694550	eng	Get in the car, quick!
11694563	eng	Do you know my sister?
11694648	eng	The Athenians had many gods.
11694665	eng	Enrico continued to read books.
11694692	eng	The actors would wear masks.
11694751	eng	That boy's hair is brown.
11694753	eng	Your guys' reputation precedes you.
11694762	eng	Don't eat too many potatoes!
11694764	eng	How is our neighbour doing?
11694765	eng	The moonlight flooded the room.
11694769	eng	She was deepening the holes.
11694776	eng	You have two new messages.
11694784	eng	I am not deluding myself.

11694908	eng	You quickly took a shower.
11694939	eng	I guess that's a problem.
11694949	eng	He gently spread my legs.
11694953	eng	It's not an easy decision.
11695139	eng	I finally got the opportunity.
11695154	eng	She graduated with top marks.
11695187	eng	I play tennis every Thursday.
11695191	eng	I've had a stressful week.

11695280	eng	They walked towards the bridge.
11695295	eng	It was an inopportune moment.
11695462	eng	We didn’t even do anything!
11695491	eng	Do dragons like to snuggle?
11695526	eng	Let's step into the shade.
11695557	eng	Enrico found a job there.
11695648	eng	Things aren't quite that clear-cut.
11695720	eng	Flavio had to look again.
11695732	eng	Flavio seemed strange to Isabella.
11695759	eng	Flavio got to the kitchen.
11695765	eng	Flavio looked into Isabella's window.
11695775	eng	Flavio expected somebody to knock.

11695863	eng	Flavio briefly spoke with Isabella.
11695868	eng	Flavio appeared in the window.
11695874	eng	Flavio seemed genuinely freaked out.
11695884	eng	Flavio was just playing funny.
11695889	eng	Flavio spoke back to Isabella.
11695892	eng	Flavio wasn't making that up.
11695893	eng	Flavio lifted up the blinds.
11695902	eng	Flavio pulled back the blinds.
11695916	eng	Flavio lived much farther away.
11695926	eng	Flavio wasn't thinking of anything.

11695961	eng	Flavio kept watching the man.
11695963	eng	Flavio lived in the neighborhood.
11695964	eng	Flavio found a new letter.
11695967	eng	Who was leaving those letters?
11695972	eng	Flavio seemed insane to Isabella.
11695981	eng	Flavio locked the sliding door.
11695982	eng	Flavio was in the basement.
11695990	eng	Flavio got the lock fixed.
11695991	eng	Flavio didn't see anything else.

11696201	eng	Flavio took a look around.
11696221	eng	Flavio didn't follow Isabella's car.
11696242	eng	The dermatologist examined my skin.
11696268	eng	What's your earliest childhood memory?
11696296	eng	I could feel myself trembling.
11696379	eng	I drove around the neighbourhood.
11696399	eng	That bank vault is impenetrable.
11696404	eng	We all met in class.
11696405	eng	Flavio missed his fourth-hour class.
11696407	eng	Flavio went on his phone.

11696428	eng	Flavio walked off the path.
11696431	eng	Flavio was in the woods.
11696441	eng	Flavio snuck onto the bus.
11696450	eng	Flavio boarded the bus home.
11696465	eng	Flavio didn't follow Isabella in.
11696466	eng	Flavio was still standing there.
11696491	eng	The theater was really fancy.
11696493	eng	Flavio went to his seat.
11696494	eng	Flavio looked around the theater.
11696499	eng	Flavio didn't have any money.
11696509	eng	Flavio seemed like a creep.
11696511	eng	The bathroom door opened again.
11696513	eng	Flavio wasn't in his seat.
11696523	eng	The guards started to emerge.
11696533	eng	Flavio took the tower down.

11696600	eng	Flavio knocked the soldier down.
11696610	eng	Flavio called for Rima’s name.

11696629	eng	Flavio was in the village.
11696637	eng	Flavio was looking for gold.
11696638	eng	Flavio made it out alive.
11696640	eng	Flavio was hiding something dangerous.

11818848	eng	Fyodor was in the rain.
11818860	eng	Fortunately, they all made it.

11821839	eng	The cat was healthy again.
11821845	eng	The money was long gone.

11822024	eng	Igor decided to start driving.
11822047	eng	Igor decided to continue on.
11822064	eng	The sky has become cloudier.

11823567	eng	Igor ran outside Anna's tent.
11823576	eng	Igor slowly approached Anna's tent.
11823584	eng	Igor retreated to his tent.

11826712	eng	The herd is under threat.
11826731	eng	Igor finally tasted the honey.
11826738	eng	Igor got stung by ants.
11826747	eng	Tuaregs live off their camels.
11826761	eng	We rarely slaughter our cows.

12005292	eng	He married a young woman.
12005439	eng	You can't have it all.

12007246	eng	People run away from them.
12007255	eng	People run away from us.

12007421	eng	Those have to be shortened.
12007422	eng	These have to be shortened.

12008839	eng	Have you seen me before?
12009410	eng	She's tired of your lies.
12009486	eng	I'm sick of your lies.
12009510	eng	The bookstores are not libraries.
12009528	eng	I don't like your flag.
12009842	eng	I bought a red iron.
12010037	eng	He will let you pass.
12010444	eng	It is a real fear.

12013239	eng	No, thank you very much.
12013247	eng	Don't get into any mischief!
12013262	eng	What's making you so miserable?
12013267	eng	Suddenly, the lights came on.
12013356	eng	I don't like reading books.
12013360	eng	They thought they were superior.
12013455	eng	Don't worry, it's not contagious.

12013686	eng	Your cuddles are the best.
12013765	eng	I have a brown horse.

12013823	eng	My son understands Kabyle well.
12013824	eng	He said it in Kabyle.
12013838	eng	It's the Kabyle national anthem.
12013863	eng	Kabyle is easy to learn.
12013871	eng	Me, I'm a Kabyle citizen.

12015587	eng	I've always wanted an oinker.
12015680	eng	Tom didn't see anything suspicious.
12015749	eng	You're my precious neko girl.
12015756	eng	Need a relaxing massage, sweetheart?
12015782	eng	It is ten o'clock sharp.
12015900	eng	Tom was an honorable man.
12015902	eng	I was doing a bit.
12015903	eng	It was just a bit.
12015912	eng	BDSM is sex for nerds.
12015914	eng	Tom and I are frenemies.
12015948	eng	He got on the bus.
12015953	eng	I can't do the splits.
12016047	eng	I like watching TV commercials.
12016076	eng	Money talks and bullshit walks.
12016131	eng	I like that about Yumi-chan.
12016140	eng	That name rung a bell.
12016179	eng	Do you like ranch dressing?
12016303	eng	Are you tired of queuing?

12016338	eng	Do ask the old folks!
12016605	eng	He made fun of me.
12016749	eng	I wish I was younger.
12016766	eng	My intuition is surprisingly accurate.
12017838	eng	Tom is spying on me.
12017932	eng	Did Tom give you permission?
12017954	eng	This referee is not good.
12018167	eng	Tom likes playing the piano.
12018696	eng	Today was a bad day.
12018710	eng	She painted the room white.
12018733	eng	I received a strange email.
12018753	eng	I really liked this example.
12019108	eng	Tom had to exchange it.
12019110	eng	Tom couldn't have survived it.
12019140	eng	I know all these people.
12019165	eng	She's a fairly active person.

12019236	eng	We're freezing our arses off.
12019268	eng	We're freezing our asses off.
12019786	eng	My phone is being tapped.
12020427	eng	Tom appears to be singing.
12020671	eng	Tom retired from the match.
12021075	eng	He hasn't answered the phone.
12021115	eng	Which car do we take?
12021126	eng	I'm not an interesting person.

12021514	eng	You're in trouble with her.
12021554	eng	I've read that book, too.
12021603	eng	I said that to her.

12021850	eng	He never tells us anything.
12021991	eng	I don't usually have breakfast.
12021998	eng	You're all he talks about.
12022001	eng	The boy had a dog.
12022437	eng	They offered me another story.
12022474	eng	Who is a financial manager?
12022703	eng	That applies to her too.
12022704	eng	It is not a competition.
12022706	eng	He is also speaking English.

12022881	eng	Creativity is passion and love.
12023185	eng	Why are horses so fast?
12023275	eng	On Thursdays, we drink beer.
12023424	eng	Does anyone actually think that?

12051854	eng	You might fall asleep again.
12052017	eng	Make sure Tom is safe.
12052047	eng	The ban has been lifted.
12052051	eng	What does this pertain to?
12052215	eng	Tom ordered a Caesar salad.
12052508	eng	That would solve the problem.
12052552	eng	Please don't make me angry.
12052637	eng	You know what Tom did.
12052645	eng	You should have seen them.
12052649	eng	Tom was feeling pretty rotten.
12052664	eng	Are you canceling the concert?
12052683	eng	Give it a second thought.
12052696	eng	Tom had a stroke yesterday.
12052713	eng	Tom hid the remote control.
12052717	eng	We really need to leave.
12052735	eng	The porridge is too hot.
12052736	eng	Tom will never admit failure.
12052737	eng	Eat the porridge. It's good.
12052739	eng	Kalman is walking like Robocop.

12052755	eng	Tom must hate me now.
12052760	eng	What do wild hedgehogs eat?
12052768	eng	You shouldn't eat so much.
12052771	eng	Kalman fed his hedgehog insects.
12052775	eng	Kalman's bed is not made.
12052783	eng	Kalman brought a hedgehog home.
12052800	eng	Kalman handled his hedgehog gently.

12052814	eng	Kalman has so many pets.
12052837	eng	Kalman isn't Olivia's first hedgehog.
12052845	eng	Kalman's video was really boring.
12052860	eng	Kalman is new to birds.
12052873	eng	Hedgehogs need to stay warm.
12052894	eng	Hedgehogs need pretty large cages.
12052895	eng	Kalman's hedgehog was grooming itself.
12052901	eng	Hedgehogs love having hiding spots.
12053033	eng	Kalman's early life was tumultuous.
12053034	eng	Ronald Reagan's legacy is AIDS.
12053045	eng	Kalman hiked some mountain trails.
12053051	eng	Kalman heard a bear growling.
12053055	eng	Kalman's tent was fully unzipped.
12053061	eng	Kalman was walking hunched over.
12053065	eng	Kalman heard Olivia yell something.
12053076	eng	Kalman is the outdoorsy type.
12053084	eng	Can we leave Tom now?
12053094	eng	The cottage was so small.
12053121	eng	Sunlight blasted through the window.

12053134	eng	Kalman was just pacing around.
12053140	eng	Kalman had a mask on.
12053176	eng	Kalman returned to his tent.

12053206	eng	Kalman started camping a lot.
12053210	eng	Kalman slept in a bed.
12053217	eng	Kalman didn't sleep very well.
12053224	eng	Kalman was a bigger guy.
12053230	eng	Kalman heard that voice again.
12053231	eng	Kalman's deep voice scared Olivia.
12053234	eng	Kalman just nodded and laughed.
12053247	eng	Kalman changed his tone instantly.
12053249	eng	Kalman went to the window.
12053257	eng	Kalman stayed awake until dawn.
12053270	eng	Kalman listened to an audiobook.
12053291	eng	Kalman just started to laugh.
12053293	eng	Kalman turned around to Olivia.
12053301	eng	Kalman wanted to rob Olivia.
12053305	eng	Kalman ordered us a pizza.
12053310	eng	Something brushed against the tent.
12053312	eng	Kalman ran into the house.
12053316	eng	The door began to jiggle.
12053321	eng	Kalman is an adult now.
12053333	eng	Kalman heard Olivia breathing heavily.
12053335	eng	Kalman didn't say anything back.
12053390	eng	Kalman was afraid to look.
12053831	eng	I have eaten an egg.
12053838	eng	My sibling wrote many stories.
12053840	eng	He's looking for an entrance.

12054207	eng	Tom made you some food.
12054209	eng	The party should be fun.
12054223	eng	I informed you about it.
12054248	eng	This is making me giddy.
12054256	eng	Are you all caught up?
12054265	eng	Tom is an escaped convict.
12054266	eng	Could you pause the video?
12054285	eng	Tom may have other intentions.
12054303	eng	Be home by three o'clock.
12054315	eng	You should've told us sooner.

12054348	eng	Tom buys fish from us.
12054349	eng	Tom sent us some candy.
12054354	eng	You'll need to help Tom.
12054355	eng	Tom enjoys what he's doing.
12054369	eng	Let me pay this time.

12054441	eng	They'll be burying Tom tomorrow.
12054442	eng	Did you frost your hair?
12054454	eng	Why should Tom think so?
12054455	eng	Tom heard everything I said.
12054457	eng	Is your girlfriend Canadian, too?
12054459	eng	Is Tom leaving this office?
12054482	eng	Tom and Mary swapped horses.
12054488	eng	Tom died in that crash.
12054492	eng	Tom and John are half-brothers.
12054494	eng	Mary and Alice are half-sisters.
12054495	eng	Did Tom go to sleep?

12054520	eng	Guess what's in this box.
12054534	eng	You've left a light on.
12054536	eng	Tom's coat was really warm.

12061515	eng	I'll let Tom sleep in.
12061538	eng	The picnic table was vacant.
12061549	eng	Kalman was tiptoeing towards Olivia.
12061559	eng	Kalman didn't actually know Olivia.
12061587	eng	I heard about a miracle.
12061611	eng	The meat was perfectly sliced.
12061617	eng	Kalman dumped the body there.
12061620	eng	Kalman left in a hurry.
12061627	eng	Kalman's body was dumped somewhere.
12061632	eng	Tom didn't have any complaints.
12061764	eng	I want to help others.
12061827	eng	Someone wants to kill you.
12061846	eng	Have a brandy with us.
12061892	eng	Take care of your appearance.
12061904	eng	That must be Tom's coat.
12061918	eng	Judaism isn't a proselytizing religion.
12061942	eng	Are you already seeing somebody?
12061956	eng	What happened to the synagogue?
12061975	eng	Killing Tom was a mistake.
12061978	eng	Are you all sitting down?
12062013	eng	Why did you choose Tom?
12062026	eng	This is a Canadian tradition.
12062037	eng	Is Tom a beggar again?
12062038	eng	I have gifts for you.
12062064	eng	That one is my cup.
12062102	eng	Normally, this door is locked.
12062112	eng	What frightened Tom so much?
12062117	eng	We're waiting for you outside.
12062178	eng	I talked to Tom first.
12062259	eng	We have a plan already.
12062314	eng	Are you all on drugs?
12062342	eng	You're always the humble one.
12062378	eng	When did Chuck's Diner open?
12062400	eng	I spoke to Tom's son.
12062775	eng	Our apartment is too small.
12062777	eng	Our children are adults now.
12062778	eng	Our children have grown up.
12062781	eng	Tom has been using us.
12062783	eng	Tom gave me his cabin.
12062785	eng	Tom is tough but fair.
12062790	eng	Tom will be meeting us.
12062796	eng	Our children are asleep upstairs.
12062800	eng	Tom has become a star.
12062802	eng	Our conversation lasted several hours.
12062891	eng	He refuses to be silenced.
12062893	eng	It was quite a spectacle.
12062926	eng	Wait, what did you say?
12062930	eng	Do you have any shampoo?
12062931	eng	Have you got any shampoo?
12062932	eng	I studied in private school.
12062941	eng	He slipped on the road.
12062961	eng	Did you change the pillow?
12062999	eng	Where's the nearest shopping centre?
12063010	eng	What's your favourite TV advert?
12063033	eng	Does the manananggal eat people?
12063058	eng	That must be Tom arriving.
12063063	eng	Tom is pretty interesting, actually.
12063065	eng	Tom hurt Mary really badly.
12063066	eng	Obviously, that was a mistake.
12063068	eng	That must have hurt Tom.
12063073	eng	You should've stopped the fight.
12063074	eng	Tom went to the bar.
12063075	eng	Tomorrow could be much worse.
12063083	eng	Tom may still blow it.
12063086	eng	Drinking isn't allowed on campus.
12063121	eng	What a fiendishly clever plan!
12063125	eng	Here is my business card.
12063126	eng	I asked Tom about it.
12063128	eng	Noise is no problem here.
12063143	eng	Does Tom sometimes mention Mary?
12063148	eng	My zip code has changed.
12063155	eng	Tom always behaves like that.
12063162	eng	I want to help myself.
12063167	eng	Welcome to the good life.
12063170	eng	Tom hurt me again yesterday.
12063174	eng	Tom often works at night.
12063177	eng	I had the strangest dream.
12063205	eng	This area is still uninhabited.
12063206	eng	Tom and Mary both survived.
12063211	eng	Her child wore me out.
12063212	eng	His child wore me out.
12063213	eng	I knew Tom wasn't well.
12063214	eng	She didn't see the child.
12063216	eng	Are you talking about women?
12063227	eng	You work for me now.
12063236	eng	This is a Canadian song.
12063263	eng	Have you met Tom lately?
12063270	eng	Nobody did anything about it.
12063273	eng	Never leave Mary by herself.
12063278	eng	I have nothing worth stealing.
12063288	eng	Thanks for the hot dog.
12063299	eng	That must be Tom's handwriting.
12063303	eng	Let's hope Tom was convinced.
12063309	eng	You almost got yourself killed.
12063340	eng	Is that what Tom does?
12063354	eng	I learned a lesson today.
12063358	eng	Is Tom still with you?
12063564	eng	What's your bedtime routine like?
12063639	eng	Ziri didn't get his wish.
12063682	eng	Why did Kalman get promoted?
12063717	eng	I had a bad trip.
12063773	eng	It imposes an unnecessary burden.
12063786	eng	Tom has decided to leave.
12063788	eng	You aren't doing anything wrong.
12063791	eng	Make sure Tom is OK.
12063795	eng	I heard about that case.
12063797	eng	Tom is on Mary's list.
12063802	eng	I have to get started.
12063809	eng	Are you talking about marriage?
12063822	eng	What Tom says is right.
12063826	eng	Nobody knows who you are.
12063847	eng	How deep is that hole?
12063865	eng	What are you hunting for?
12063888	eng	Keep Tom away from here.
12063893	eng	What a dope I was!
12063901	eng	I got rid of Tom.
12063906	eng	Let me brush my teeth.
12063927	eng	I had Tom call Mary.
12063952	eng	Welcome to our new office.
12063962	eng	Did you see any soldiers?
12063977	eng	Tom may be on board.
12063998	eng	I heard Tom was around.
12064029	eng	I heard what you did.
12064041	eng	Tom should be back today.
12064047	eng	Now is our only chance.
12064076	eng	Where do I fit in?
12064099	eng	Some jewelry has been stolen.
12064106	eng	Guess what Tom brought you.
12064187	eng	Call as soon as possible.
12064206	eng	How much did Tom pay?
12064235	eng	Tom called Dr. Jackson immediately.
12064251	eng	This is a Catholic hospital.
12064285	eng	You have to warn Tom.
12064291	eng	Tom was right about Boston.
12064297	eng	I think they're hiding something.
12064298	eng	That law had been repealed.
12064307	eng	I had a previous appointment.
12064328	eng	Are you all in position?
12064333	eng	Are you investigating Tom Jackson?
12064348	eng	We are at a gathering.
12064349	eng	Keep out of my room.
12064357	eng	Obviously, we did something wrong.
12064358	eng	Tom had given his word.
12064364	eng	I guess Tom found it.
12064366	eng	Someone wants to kill Tom.
12064367	eng	How about some orange juice?
12064371	eng	Are you still serving breakfast?
12064378	eng	Hide in the storage room.
12064383	eng	I had the strangest dreams.
12064387	eng	I have nothing against Australia.
12064396	eng	Hang in there for me.
12064407	eng	Give this money to Tom.
12064410	eng	Where do I find Tom?
12064412	eng	The club was very crowded.
12064430	eng	Where are the olive trees?
12064444	eng	Are you working with Tom?
12064447	eng	Tom will meet us there.
12064482	eng	Tom is a total riot.
12064487	eng	Dogs are funny, aren't they?
12064492	eng	Tom sends you his regards.
12064498	eng	Are you talking about surfing?
12064506	eng	They probably had an accident.
12064508	eng	Tom asked for shore leave.
12064512	eng	A child needs his dad.
12064528	eng	Tom should've left this morning.
12064529	eng	Are the Jacksons still around?
12064534	eng	Tom is stark raving mad.
12064545	eng	I asked for a brandy.
12064552	eng	Tom could perhaps help you.
12064561	eng	Did you see the photographs?
12064571	eng	Tom is a real bore.
12064575	eng	We will seek the truth.
12064583	eng	Tom saved the day again.
12064589	eng	Do you want some cereal?
12064600	eng	Tom may well be innocent.
12064625	eng	Tom knew what poverty meant.
12064657	eng	Tom started the fire himself.
12064668	eng	Tom was very badly burned.
12064769	eng	Tom will go back home.
12064800	eng	Tom said we must fight.
12064804	eng	What are you proposing exactly?
12064809	eng	Is Tom there with you?
12064828	eng	Are you busy this weekend?
12064875	eng	Tell Tom to forget it.
12064921	eng	Tell Tom he was right.
12064948	eng	I knew Tom liked me.
12064961	eng	Tom may be from Boston.
12064973	eng	Tom is speechless right now.
12064978	eng	Only Tom can hurt me.
12064989	eng	My youngest is getting married.
12064999	eng	This man is the victor.
12065002	eng	Tom hurt me the most.
12065020	eng	What is your work here?
12065030	eng	Nobody can find us here.
12065041	eng	I met with Tom tonight.
12065063	eng	Your behaviour is not acceptable.
12065066	eng	Let's start with a pint.
12065078	eng	You drank too much brandy.
12065097	eng	I want to help everyone.
12065108	eng	The canteen's out of chips.
12065125	eng	Order yourself something to eat.
12065162	eng	I feel like dancing now.
12065179	eng	Let's talk about our pets.
12065212	eng	Tom may have other plans.
12065217	eng	You're a very intelligent man.
12065231	eng	Do you have a blender?
12065266	eng	Where did you steal that?
12065271	eng	Mary got ahead of herself.
12065295	eng	I installed a nanny cam.
12065300	eng	Call a taxi for me.
12065308	eng	What are you mumbling about?
12065315	eng	Our paths rarely cross anymore.
12065321	eng	Tom has an apartment downtown.
12065327	eng	No one knew what happened.
12065333	eng	Tom is an amazing choreographer.
12065335	eng	Tom and Mary rescued John.
12065337	eng	Tom has concocted a plan.
12065377	eng	Tom jumped off a bridge.
12065390	eng	How about moving to Boston?
12065391	eng	God bless Tom and Mary.
12065398	eng	I spoke to Tom tonight.
12065403	eng	Sing along if you like.
12065406	eng	Tom suggests paying the ransom.
12065411	eng	You omitted one important detail.
12065416	eng	What happened to the church?
12065417	eng	Tom has to trust me.
12065419	eng	Tom has fulfilled his promise.
12065421	eng	I want to help here.
12065422	eng	Is Tom a reliable witness?
12065423	eng	I had a bad nightmare.
12065429	eng	Tom is no longer cooperating.
12065433	eng	I heard about your project.
12065439	eng	Tom killed himself this morning.
12065444	eng	I had a blast today.
12065454	eng	Are you cross with me?
12065477	eng	I meant to help Tom.
12065479	eng	Did Tom just insult me?
12065480	eng	Are you all done practicing?
12065481	eng	Tom had been set up.
12065488	eng	I had a boyfriend once.
12065491	eng	Tom is ready to continue.
12065493	eng	Tom would never live here.
12065495	eng	Was Tom drunk last night?
12065501	eng	I got a new trumpet.
12065511	eng	Some people would say that.
12065513	eng	Tom wants to play basketball.
12065517	eng	That's something worth waiting for.
12065559	eng	Why are you hitting me?
12065577	eng	There has been a delay.
12065580	eng	How can we convince Tom?
12065597	eng	I should've left with Tom.
12065618	eng	This is a rough draft.
12065632	eng	Tom lost his warehouse job.
12065660	eng	You have a Ukrainian passport.
12065721	eng	Many soldiers lost their lives.
12065723	eng	One can never stop learning.
12065726	eng	Tom did that last week.
12065735	eng	I used to drink brandy.
12065746	eng	I was speaking to Tom.
12065762	eng	Take care of yourself first.
12065763	eng	Does Tom know you smoke?
12065775	eng	Mr. Jackson's students worshipped him.
12065779	eng	We're waiting for the results.
12065789	eng	I spoke to Tom, too.
12065824	eng	This cheesecake is pretty good.
12065867	eng	Nothing can be changed now.
12065872	eng	Tom is tight with Mary.
12065874	eng	Why did you move these?
12065942	eng	In trade, time is money.
12065946	eng	I bet Tom got delayed.
12065968	eng	Are you all done now?
12065996	eng	Kalman wore his lucky sweater.
12066001	eng	Kalman is Algerian like you.
12066003	eng	You probably want this back.
12066005	eng	"What are you watching?" "Hulk."
12066014	eng	"No hard feelings?" "None whatsoever."
12066054	eng	Are you all kidding me?
12066217	eng	Sami has become a priest.
12066233	eng	The authorities should be notified.
12066235	eng	This young lady loves me!
12066240	eng	Does every star have planets?
12066241	eng	She's not afraid of anything.
12066299	eng	Tom was a big winner.
12066304	eng	Stop going through Mom's purse.
12066349	eng	The scandal ruined her career.
12066357	eng	I have to get supplies.
12066378	eng	The cat licked her claws.
12066399	eng	Tom had his own bike.
12066481	eng	I had a big dinner.
12066641	eng	It really is quiet here.
12066707	eng	That's why I helped you.
12066746	eng	Welcome to my childhood home.
12066753	eng	How's our mutual acquaintance doing?
12066803	eng	Tom just looked at Mary.
12066883	eng	I felt responsible for Tom.
12066926	eng	I do not remember you.
12066928	eng	Tell me about Tom's concert.
12067129	eng	Where is your oven mitt?
12067218	eng	Tell Tom to follow me.
12067233	eng	Can you cover my shift?
12067236	eng	I met Tom months ago.
12067251	eng	One day we will understand.
12067270	eng	He came first at home.
12067326	eng	Tom owns the property now.
12067335	eng	I had a bad date.
12067386	eng	Tom is on lunch break.
12067400	eng	Lots of girls enjoy dancing.
12067536	eng	That's the tool I need.
12067587	eng	I had a bad lunch.
12067698	eng	Nobody will ever find you.
12067724	eng	I've never liked you, Tom.
12067732	eng	This is a Canadian company.
12067788	eng	I think I see Tom.
12067791	eng	We're not in their league.
12067825	eng	Cats are too much sometimes.
12067836	eng	What happened to the temple?
12067840	eng	I had a bad migraine.
12067842	eng	Where is the nearest bar?
12067868	eng	I think everyone was petrified.
12067883	eng	You kept calling me Tom.
12067887	eng	Here we are in Boston.
12067911	eng	This was made by Tom.
12067912	eng	This is an amazing town.
12068071	eng	Coffee spilled on my shirt.
12068077	eng	I am leaving this company.
12068145	eng	Tom has become very lazy.
12068146	eng	You'd better cross that out.
12068147	eng	Will Tom solve the problem?
12068149	eng	Tom is in the back.
12068150	eng	Nobody will listen to me.
12068151	eng	Has Tom teased you before?
12068157	eng	Tom bought himself a hamster.
12068159	eng	Tom refused to eat breakfast.
12068163	eng	We camped in the snow.
12068167	eng	Tom is going into town.
12068170	eng	You know I know Tom.
12068172	eng	That may already have happened.
12068178	eng	Everyone ran away from Tom.
12068194	eng	Are you still studying biology?
12068197	eng	Does Tom really know Mary?
12068198	eng	Is that an active volcano?
12068204	eng	Where is the red pepper?
12068207	eng	Tom may still be involved.
12068208	eng	Are you a rock climber?
12068231	eng	I know Tom loved Mary.
12068234	eng	I was brought up Catholic.
12068237	eng	Tom does all the talking.
12068248	eng	Act 3 will begin soon.
12068282	eng	Are you all done packing?
12068285	eng	A kid needs his dad.
12068290	eng	I love freshly-squeezed orange juice.
12068304	eng	Am I a bad guy?
12068340	eng	Let me go find Tom.
12068342	eng	Tom and his wife came.
12068344	eng	Where did you hide Tom?
12068348	eng	Tom has a bad shoulder.
12068355	eng	I was there visiting Tom.
12068357	eng	When will Tom be returning?
12068360	eng	Was last year this bad?
12068377	eng	I offered Mary some chocolate.
12068379	eng	Tom, should I call Mary?
12068399	eng	Let's talk about our hobbies.
12068423	eng	That window is still unlocked.
12068428	eng	Let's never discuss this again.
12068475	eng	Show Tom your photo albums.
12068548	eng	I heard Tom is dead.
12068549	eng	Would you like an olive?
12068550	eng	Give Tom back his guns.
12068552	eng	I talked to your parents.
12068553	eng	I've talked to your parents.
12068561	eng	I came back for Tom.
12068643	eng	Tom said Mary may come.
12068646	eng	Tom said Mary might come.
12068651	eng	I had the wrong idea.
12068659	eng	Is your boyfriend a Canadian?
12068660	eng	Is your boyfriend Canadian, too?
12068665	eng	Tom hasn't always been blind.
12068666	eng	Is your girlfriend a Canadian?
12068669	eng	I bought this for myself.
12068675	eng	I'll get back around noon.
12068676	eng	I'll be back around noon.
12068684	eng	Tom never talked about that.
12068685	eng	Kalman's men ambushed their ambushers.
12068689	eng	Are you all moved in?
12068718	eng	Tom abandoned his best friends.
12068732	eng	Mary will do everything herself.
12068733	eng	Nobody does anything for nothing.
12068735	eng	Nobody does anything for free.
12068743	eng	How should I tell Tom?
12068755	eng	Tom has been complaining again.
12068765	eng	Tell us more about Tom.
12068782	eng	Does Tom know this story?
12068791	eng	Were Tom and Mary close?
12068848	eng	Tom hurt me right here.
12068893	eng	Does Tom own a house?
12068909	eng	I had the same choice.
12068988	eng	I had a better one.
12069001	eng	Hide here for the night.
12069004	eng	Tell Tom about the concert.
12069008	eng	Don't you miss your mother?
12069010	eng	Are you talking about money?
12069016	eng	Tom, why are you here?
12069035	eng	I heard about Tom's visit.
12069199	eng	Tom is a fantastic violinist.
12069202	eng	Tom is an amazing violinist.
12069205	eng	What are you three discussing?
12069209	eng	I confronted Tom right away.
12069211	eng	This is a big company.
12069296	eng	Cross to the other bank.
12069305	eng	Tom hurt himself in practice.
12069325	eng	Tom may have other ideas.
12069349	eng	Do you three live together?
12069350	eng	Sir, this is my mother.
12069380	eng	What else did you hear?
12069531	eng	Did you see Tom fight?
12069545	eng	I heard about that boy.
12069555	eng	I sent Tom a picture.
12069599	eng	You sound like you care.
12069614	eng	I had a Canadian cellmate.
12069622	eng	Why would he say that?
12069632	eng	Do you want your walker?
12069670	eng	Does Tom ever get upset?
12069674	eng	Tom may have bought this.
12069677	eng	I was thinking of participating.
12069682	eng	I spoke with Tom myself.
12069703	eng	Do people still do that?
12069707	eng	What are we good at?
12069709	eng	How are you and Tom?
12069731	eng	Tom may agree with you.
12069741	eng	Tom was a little crazy.
12069751	eng	Mary bathed herself in milk.
12069801	eng	Your predictions never come true.
12069865	eng	I'll help you with French.
12069875	eng	Tom has no close relatives.
12069878	eng	I once won thirty dollars.
12069880	eng	I had a beer first.
12069892	eng	Did you see Tom's boots?
12069894	eng	Welcome to my modest abode.
12069939	eng	I let go of Tom.
12069942	eng	Did you see the painting?
12069949	eng	Obviously, that was a lie.
12069955	eng	This is a fantastic location.
12069964	eng	This is an amazing location.
12069979	eng	How did Tom find Mary?
12070001	eng	Act like nothing ever happened.
12070005	eng	Tom sold his old guitar.
12070011	eng	I wish I'd slept longer.
12070017	eng	I came to get Tom.
12070020	eng	Is that an edible mushroom?
12070021	eng	Tom welshed on the deal.
12070036	eng	I stopped watching the news.
12070038	eng	I've stopped watching the news.
12070040	eng	This is my youngest grandchild.
12070046	eng	Grab me something to eat.
12070050	eng	God showed me the way.
12070051	eng	Do you like this poem?
12070054	eng	Tom got into the water.
12070072	eng	We climbed over the fence.
12070074	eng	Tom could be your replacement.
12070077	eng	Mary is indeed very beautiful.
12070079	eng	You need to drink something.
12070081	eng	Give Tom some more space.
12070084	eng	Tom welshed on the bet.
12070092	eng	He lives in this neighbourhood.
12070095	eng	I know everyone is concerned.
12070097	eng	That would be more likely.
12070116	eng	You know what you want.
12070117	eng	What a bunch of weaklings!
12070121	eng	I had my house repainted.
12070141	eng	Did you find any gold?
12070143	eng	Mary drank herself to death.
12070146	eng	Does Tom really like me?
12070193	eng	What do you like reading?
12070264	eng	Did you see Tom tonight?
12070274	eng	There's a terrible draught here.
12070275	eng	Tom does more than that.
12070277	eng	Your father adores your mother.
12070284	eng	Tom may well be guilty.
12070287	eng	They wallowed in the mud.
12070290	eng	You did it without thinking.
12070291	eng	You did that without thinking.
12070294	eng	Let's walk to school together.
12070297	eng	Do you want a pint?
12070299	eng	How old is her son?
12070300	eng	How old is their son?
12070303	eng	It was a memorable night.
12070304	eng	It was a memorable evening.
12070316	eng	He showed me around town.
12070319	eng	Tom was such a coward.
12070333	eng	My jacket's zip got stuck.
12070335	eng	Let me ask Tom myself.
12070348	eng	I avoid flying whenever possible.
12070352	eng	I should've done it myself.
12070360	eng	Did Tom get a promotion?
12070363	eng	Has anyone been mistreating you?
12070369	eng	You've got a flat tyre.
12070371	eng	You have a flat tyre.
12070396	eng	I think that's a myth.
12070403	eng	Tom is a good stepfather.
12070414	eng	Sing us a few songs.
12070426	eng	I guess the party's over.
12070437	eng	Sing us a Canadian song.
12070443	eng	I drank way too much.
12070460	eng	Tom asked what had happened.
12070462	eng	Add a bit of seasoning.
12070480	eng	We hiked along the shore.
12070484	eng	Tom snuck into the storeroom.
12070489	eng	Tom killed his own son.
12070491	eng	Did Tom drive you home?
12070494	eng	Are you coming by tomorrow?
12070524	eng	I thought Tom was upstairs.
12070527	eng	You understand our traditions well.
12070534	eng	Is Tom happy about it?
12070539	eng	Have you met Tom recently?
12070550	eng	Tom must know the way.
12070554	eng	Tom killed himself at home.
12070557	eng	What could I have done?
12070560	eng	Tom was right about you.
12070566	eng	You sound like a kid.
12070567	eng	Did Tom ever mention me?
12070583	eng	Always try to be humble.
12070602	eng	How much did Tom get?
12070607	eng	Your puppy is so cute.
12070610	eng	Put Tom next to Mary.
12070611	eng	Are you all getting this?
12070619	eng	Tom is such a klutz.
12070628	eng	I spoke to Tom's sister.
12070634	eng	I had a bad accident.
12070636	eng	That fellow's name is Tom.
12070669	eng	Did Tom call about Mary?
12070671	eng	Tom is here to win.
12070672	eng	I guess something was wrong.
12070674	eng	I talked to Tom's teachers.
12070683	eng	Why was Tom so late?
12070684	eng	I heard Boston is safe.
12070688	eng	I went into the forest.
12070689	eng	I was married to Tom.
12070721	eng	I had Tom come over.
12070727	eng	Was Tom working with Mary?
12070730	eng	Tom would never help us.
12070736	eng	Tom hurt his back today.
12070738	eng	How did Tom damage this?
12070762	eng	He kicked the bucket yesterday.
12070779	eng	I'm glad that you're back.
12070782	eng	I gave Tom a brandy.
12070788	eng	Tom was my last apprentice.
12070796	eng	This soup is very tasty.
12070799	eng	Why you were sent here?
12070822	eng	Everyone knows who I am.
12070838	eng	Will you have another drink?
12070842	eng	Do you like green beans?
12070852	eng	What is Tom here for?
12070867	eng	The dryer shrunk my jeans.
12070902	eng	I heard Tom is back.
12070916	eng	Tom was a brilliant man.
12070917	eng	Welcome to my birthday party.
12070918	eng	That's precisely why Tom left.
12070928	eng	Was Tom mean to you?
12070929	eng	I had a neck injury.
12070934	eng	The boss just fired us.
12070939	eng	I have a class later.
12070940	eng	Only Tom was on deck.
12070941	eng	Do you know any riddles?
12070995	eng	Numerous casualties have been reported.
12071015	eng	We got a bad start.
12071086	eng	Did the police find anything?
12071090	eng	Welcome to my secret hideout.
12071091	eng	Mary was just defending herself.
12071095	eng	This is a Canadian toy.
12071104	eng	My emergency contact is Tom.
12071107	eng	Tom and Mary were rich.
12071137	eng	Did you like the party?
12071150	eng	Please tell me about Tom.
12071153	eng	Tom said something to me.
12071160	eng	Are you excited about tomorrow?
12071162	eng	You should be getting home.
12071200	eng	Our neighborhood has three avenues.
12071227	eng	Tom found out about it.
12071268	eng	I know Tom killed himself.
12071269	eng	Haven't you seen my cat?
12071277	eng	This is our humble home.
12071291	eng	Make this right with Tom.
12071359	eng	Tom will also join us.
12071363	eng	I had three in all.
12071364	eng	I have a brother, too.
12071370	eng	One of these is enough.
12071375	eng	Tom ran into the forest.
12071379	eng	I should've brought my sweater.
12071380	eng	Tom must have taken it.
12071409	eng	Tom sounds like a Canadian.
12071467	eng	Iron's atomic number is 26.
12071506	eng	You sounded pretty upset yesterday.
12071531	eng	Guess what else Tom did.
12071538	eng	Teaching young people is important.
12071550	eng	How could I betray Tom?
12071555	eng	What are you proposing here?
12071580	eng	Tom and Mary are accountants.
12071582	eng	Let me borrow your jacket.
12071628	eng	Does your family support you?
12071641	eng	Tom was kind and courteous.
12071645	eng	I know you saw something.
12071685	eng	He did not respect me.
12071687	eng	I want to join Tom.
12071695	eng	Tom wants to hurt me.
12071697	eng	He does not respect me.
12071710	eng	I did not respect him.
12071817	eng	Which Tom do you mean?
12071837	eng	You remember things like that.
12071841	eng	That's how Tom got caught.
12071851	eng	Have you heard anything similar?
12071919	eng	Where did you eat supper?
12071933	eng	What do your guests want?
12071957	eng	Is Tom on this bus?
12071973	eng	Tom was glaring at me.
12071980	eng	Welcome to both of you.
12072075	eng	Tom is coming to town.
12072089	eng	My heart belongs to Tom.
12072101	eng	Tom thinks Mary got engaged.
12072104	eng	Are you still stressed out?
12072200	eng	Tom seems to be mad.
12072209	eng	I checked that room myself.
12072223	eng	How are things going there?
12072227	eng	I thought Tom was retiring.
12072233	eng	Are you all going away?
12072241	eng	Where are they holding Tom?
12072273	eng	Tom is a decent man.
12072288	eng	Do you have enough traps?
12072400	eng	You're probably wearing Tom's socks.
12072439	eng	A package arrived from Boston.
12072447	eng	Tom visited me yesterday afternoon.
12072486	eng	Tom is actually very wealthy.
12072548	eng	Tom has moved back home.
12072553	eng	Tom may have been murdered.
12072558	eng	Tom wants to hypnotize me.
12072604	eng	Guess who I saw yesterday.
12072613	eng	Cross your fingers for us.
12072618	eng	Give this umbrella to Tom.
12072627	eng	Mary tasted the water herself.
12072629	eng	Act 3 was all right.
12072630	eng	What a charming young woman!
12072631	eng	I would never kill Tom.
12072634	eng	A kid needs his father.
12072660	eng	How was your family reunion?
12072661	eng	Do as Tom tells you.
12072674	eng	When is the grand opening?
12072723	eng	Tom is a southpaw pitcher.
12072724	eng	Tom is a left-handed pitcher.
12072739	eng	Have you seen my cat?
12072749	eng	I thought Tom was up.
12072753	eng	Was Tom driving that night?
12072759	eng	The box contains five apples.
12072760	eng	I have nothing against foreigners.
12072768	eng	I came looking for Tom.
12072788	eng	Has Tom helped Mary recently?
12072816	eng	Tom lives across the bay.
12072830	eng	Where did Tom send you?
12072833	eng	Another word, and you're dead.
12072834	eng	Tom was just as stubborn.
12072838	eng	Sometimes I think of Tom.
12072845	eng	Are you cross about something?
12072853	eng	Tom took it very seriously.
12072862	eng	Tom and I spoke earlier.
12072871	eng	You aren't a good liar.
12072903	eng	What is Boston famous for?
12072908	eng	Did you use a lawnmower?
12072909	eng	Was Tom good at anything?
12072911	eng	You're just like my mother.
12072991	eng	Just remember what Tom said.
12072995	eng	This one is my favorite.
12072998	eng	Welcome to being a mom.
12073032	eng	Anything is possible in Boston.
12073033	eng	Tom probably did that here.
12073037	eng	Are you enjoying the party?
12073102	eng	Let Tom know we're coming.
12073147	eng	Tom is still a thief.
12073150	eng	You're welcome to come again.
12073155	eng	I had a band once.
12073198	eng	Guesstimate if you have to.
12073249	eng	May I have a brandy?
12073265	eng	I heard Tom is next.
12073268	eng	Did you find anything good?
12073273	eng	I had a better offer.
12073323	eng	I found Tom and Mary.
12073378	eng	Tell me about Tom's divorce.
12073437	eng	Mary kept everything to herself.
12073563	eng	Tom and Mary frequently quarrel.
12073566	eng	You're an extremely intelligent man.
12073567	eng	Tom took me to Boston.
12073571	eng	Tom should've parked further away.
12073610	eng	Are you all leaving today?
12073616	eng	What are you protesting about?
12073645	eng	Help me with Tom, please.
12073671	eng	Are you still cold, Tom?
12073771	eng	Tom has an apartment upstairs.
12073772	eng	Hide in here for now.
12073776	eng	Will you call Tom back?
12073799	eng	What a dope you are!
12073837	eng	I was standing behind Tom.
12073843	eng	Let me be with Tom.
12073854	eng	I've had three moles removed.
12073870	eng	Mary is a natural brunette.
12073873	eng	I came to stop you.
12073875	eng	Tom said I looked menacing.
12073893	eng	This novel is pretty good.
12073896	eng	I just bought an atlas.
12073924	eng	Have you met Tom Jackson?
12073927	eng	That was Tom calling again.
12073929	eng	I spoke to everyone inside.
12073934	eng	Tom insisted that we leave.
12073941	eng	You will see Tom there.
12073980	eng	Some people call me Tom.
12073983	eng	I was looking for that.
12073986	eng	Tom may already have one.
12074044	eng	Is Tom still a suspect?
12074047	eng	I heard about that man.
12074187	eng	Tom was happy to cooperate.
12074246	eng	A child needs his mother.
12074253	eng	I had a girlfriend then.
12074258	eng	Go and study in Canada.
12074360	eng	You're sitting in my place.
12074388	eng	I'm earning lots of money.
12074488	eng	What's your favorite country song?
12074493	eng	I heard about your mishap.
12074494	eng	Tom Jackson is my teacher.
12074495	eng	Do you want some more?
12074537	eng	You missed all the fun.
12074547	eng	We did something very good.
12074548	eng	Tom found me this place.
12074551	eng	I had faith in myself.
12074553	eng	How would Tom do it?
12074564	eng	I'm not interested in soccer.
12074577	eng	Shouldn't we call the police?
12074579	eng	I got a better offer.
12074580	eng	I received a better offer.
12074583	eng	Where is Tom this morning?
12074586	eng	The air here is terrible.
12074592	eng	Look. There's a plum tree.
12074600	eng	Has Tom called back yet?
12074602	eng	Dr. Jackson gave me morphine.
12074621	eng	Tom may come back again.
12074625	eng	I like to play polo.
12074626	eng	I was obsessed with Tom.
12074639	eng	What do you say, Tom?
12074640	eng	I have too many responsibilities.

12074654	eng	Tom may call before noon.
12074660	eng	Tom is still our friend.
12074662	eng	Nobody said this was easy.
12074664	eng	A poison dart killed Tom.
12074666	eng	Tom will probably never speak.
12074683	eng	I've talked to Tom already.

12075502	eng	They are afraid of dogs.
12075504	eng	They are afraid of snakes.
12075506	eng	They're not afraid at all.
12075510	eng	That may affect your health.

12078662	eng	That must be Tom's dad.
12078663	eng	Open the door right now.
12078683	eng	You could get killed there.
12078687	eng	Was Tom really with Mary?
12078700	eng	Let's build your house here.

12080176	eng	Will you see this artist?
12080178	eng	We're surrounded by the enemy.
12080204	eng	Tom was once a star.
12080223	eng	What a fight we had!
12080232	eng	Yes, we can accomplish it.
12080233	eng	Yes, we can do it.
12080240	eng	That hurt for a week.
12080243	eng	Do you like this place?
12080251	eng	All these people knew Tom.
12080265	eng	Did an insect bite you?
12080267	eng	Sometimes, waiting is very difficult!
12080282	eng	Has Tom talked to Mary?
12080297	eng	American kids don't learn enough.
12080397	eng	He is foolish and absurd.
12080400	eng	I decide to work hard.
12080402	eng	Your glasses are the best.
12080404	eng	Are you bringing your guitar?
12080427	eng	You can just switch channels.
12080428	eng	Can't you just switch channels?
12080444	eng	You should take that away.
12080484	eng	Do you know your history?
12080489	eng	I don't have other friends.
12080516	eng	You aren't getting any younger.
12080566	eng	They beseeched us to come.
12080568	eng	I'm constantly cleaning my glasses.
12080581	eng	Tom is like a brother.
12080610	eng	Tom's favorite flowers are carnations.
12080635	eng	I normally eat very little.
12080638	eng	How has Tom hurt you?
12080642	eng	How old is this rock?
12080644	eng	Tom is an uncultured pig.
12080654	eng	Kalman didn't really like that.
12080655	eng	Kalman chewed tobacco and snuffed.
12080667	eng	It happened during the fall.
12080670	eng	No one thought about it.
12080676	eng	Nobody gave it to me.
12080684	eng	Kalman knew what to expect.
12080686	eng	Kalman needs to be careful.
12080710	eng	Kalman jumped into the bed.
12080712	eng	Kalman was terrified and screaming.
12080713	eng	Kalman was drunk and scared.
12080717	eng	Kalman stayed in the bed.
12080730	eng	Kalman went down to town.
12080738	eng	Kalman kept watching the movie.
12080747	eng	Something felt wrong to me.
12080749	eng	That was really bugging me.
12080759	eng	It's also for you, Tom.
12080762	eng	Kalman and Olivia continued discussing.
12080784	eng	Kalman let Olivia go early.
12080788	eng	Kalman chilled by the pool.
12080828	eng	Kalman farted inside the closet.
12080834	eng	Kalman wasn't buying it though.
12080842	eng	I wonder if Tom remembers.
12080876	eng	I spoke to Tom again.
12080883	eng	This tastes just like chicken.
12080905	eng	What Tom did was unexpected.
12080914	eng	Why were the children screaming?
12080923	eng	I had three euros left.
12080928	eng	I had the weirdest visions.
12080972	eng	Tom was arrested yesterday afternoon.
12080980	eng	Dahlias are Tom's favorite flowers.
12081003	eng	Tom will perform here tonight.
12081035	eng	Tom would kill you both.
12081040	eng	I knew Tom had connections.
12081044	eng	Tom, come here a sec.
12081088	eng	I borrowed this from Tom.
12081095	eng	Tom gave me this bicycle.
12081099	eng	Don't cross the yellow line.
12081108	eng	Did they repair the computer?
12081113	eng	Tom objected to this idea.
12081161	eng	That must be Tom now.
12081256	eng	Tom has nothing against you.
12081312	eng	What else did Tom find?
12081317	eng	That may be a coincidence.
12081320	eng	These songs are really popular.
12081329	eng	I really like you, Tom.
12081332	eng	I had the same nightmare.
12081333	eng	Was Tom swimming with Mary?
12081339	eng	Mary was my first wife.
12081341	eng	I heard about that settlement.
12081343	eng	I have a class, too.
12081346	eng	Tomorrow I leave for Australia.
12081350	eng	That's not what was discussed.
12081354	eng	What's your favorite folk song?
12081357	eng	I thought you were rich.
12081402	eng	Did Tom sign that contract?
12081405	eng	It seems you're really tired.
12081406	eng	I believe Tom is insane.
12081407	eng	May I have another brandy?
12081415	eng	It's time to meet Tom.
12081423	eng	Which hospital is Tom in?
12081424	eng	I found what we need.
12081437	eng	Is Tom prone to violence?
12081442	eng	Why are you stopping here?
12081466	eng	Would Tom leave without Mary?
12081469	eng	Are you all still together?
12081481	eng	Tom gave me this tonight.
12081495	eng	This is a better story.
12081498	eng	Tom's parties never end early.
12081499	eng	Are you brother and sister?
12081502	eng	I made lunch for everybody.
12081512	eng	I had a bad moment.
12081514	eng	Of course, you can come.
12081534	eng	Did you have another accident?
12081539	eng	Are you the factory owner?
12081540	eng	Tom was a scam artist.
12081560	eng	I need to find proof.
12081565	eng	Did you like the brandy?
12081567	eng	What did Tom get right?
12081569	eng	Nobody jumped off the cliff.
12081572	eng	Nobody knows what it means.
12081589	eng	Tom may go to Boston.
12081591	eng	Welcome to my shabby home.
12081598	eng	That rumor will go away.
12081618	eng	Take care of my plants.
12081619	eng	That must be Mary's husband.
12081622	eng	Nobody came to Tom's funeral.
12081626	eng	You need to stay positive.
12081640	eng	Are you alone this evening?
12081645	eng	Tom may have been tired.
12081648	eng	Tom will be with us.
12081658	eng	Tom and I love you.
12081659	eng	Mistakes like this will happen.
12081663	eng	Who's been spreading these lies?
12081671	eng	Tell me about your upbringing.
12081691	eng	Nobody was in the truck.
12081702	eng	I have nothing against marriage.
12081709	eng	You were rude to Tom.
12081715	eng	Perhaps Tom will surprise you.
12081719	eng	Tom is on leave indefinitely.
12081725	eng	Let me be Santa Claus.
12081744	eng	I thought you were tired.
12081746	eng	Have you had many assistants?
12081770	eng	Tom gave evidence against me.
12081774	eng	I can finally tell you.
12081801	eng	She's at the hair salon.
12081809	eng	I'm going to get hungry.
12081814	eng	Will Tom be much longer?
12081815	eng	You've had a long life.
12081819	eng	Tom, are you packed yet?
12081822	eng	I hardly know the guy.
12081826	eng	Tom is weak and disoriented.
12081829	eng	What year are you in?
12081880	eng	Did you see Tom's expression?
12081892	eng	I warned Tom about that.
12081905	eng	Our paths might cross someday.
12081927	eng	Try to keep Tom comfortable.
12081933	eng	What does Tom actually want?
12081937	eng	Is basketball always this exciting?
12082007	eng	Ask Tom to come here.
12082031	eng	Obviously, something bad has happened.
12082035	eng	Are you afraid of pain?
12082036	eng	I wanted Tom to pay.
12082072	eng	Tom is staying with Maria.
12082074	eng	A child needs his father.
12082077	eng	Low temperatures make water freeze.
12082079	eng	Tom said we could go.
12082085	eng	I had the heating on.
12082092	eng	She is, really, very ill.
12082094	eng	The symbol '×' represents "times".
12082117	eng	Tom will stay with Mary.
12082124	eng	Act like you believe it.
12082138	eng	How long were you interrogated?
12082145	eng	How many genders are there?
12082146	eng	There are only two genders.
12082197	eng	Did Tom sometimes mention Mary?
12082206	eng	Kalman is traveling to Algiers.
12082207	eng	Dr. Jackson just released me.
12082208	eng	Are you afraid of thunder?
12082215	eng	I hate girls like Mary.
12082221	eng	Hundreds of mosques dominate Algiers.
12082224	eng	The building collapsed in 2004.
12082232	eng	The closest room is mine.
12082237	eng	The Islamophobic industry is fashionable.
12082242	eng	Kalman is a career Islamophobe.
12082249	eng	Islamophobes portray Muslims as terrorists.
12082254	eng	I was looking into it.
12082273	eng	Lajos left Olivia home alone.

12082479	eng	Lajos drove to a motel.
12082501	eng	Lajos started getting weirdly defensive.
12082505	eng	Are you cross with us?

12084509	eng	Few people have perfect pitch.
12084510	eng	Tom had a big heart.
12084540	eng	Why are you attacking me?
12084543	eng	Is that Tom in there?
12084557	eng	People like what I do.
12084569	eng	Bring me Tom and Mary.
12084570	eng	You aren't on the list.
12084591	eng	I miss you like crazy.
12084672	eng	I was here with Tom.
12084678	eng	Tell us about the Jacksons.
12084743	eng	Did Tom deliver the letter?
12084746	eng	Are you dating anyone now?
12084852	eng	The battery does not load.
12084864	eng	I have a bruise here.
12084944	eng	Let me borrow your bicycle.
12084951	eng	Tom, you have to eat.
12084985	eng	It's just easier that way.
12085022	eng	You'll stay home with me.
12085023	eng	Tell me about Tom later.
12085024	eng	I heard about it already.
12085032	eng	We crossed the border together.
12085137	eng	It was always like this.
12085144	eng	Tom's lawyer got him acquitted.
12085146	eng	You're my very best friend.
12085247	eng	Were you ever in prison?
12085251	eng	Did you help that woman?
12085358	eng	We know you framed Tom.
12085360	eng	That's the screwdriver I need.
12085512	eng	This is a good horse.
12085526	eng	Tom isn't trained for that.
12085589	eng	Tom slept in the forest.
12085592	eng	This is a Canadian coin.
12085635	eng	She married the following year.
12085644	eng	Poor is an ugly word.
12085647	eng	Tom will be the leader.
12085650	eng	Are you all done here?
12085658	eng	Your word is worth nothing.
12085732	eng	This is the Canadian flag.
12085760	eng	This is the Japanese flag.
12085769	eng	Have I done something stupid?
12085851	eng	Tom never played with Mary.
12085874	eng	Tom hurt me really bad.
12085963	eng	Are you talking about Boston?
12085965	eng	Tom lent this to me.
12085987	eng	She ran into the house.
12085992	eng	The sick child healed quickly.
12086007	eng	I thought you were Catholic.
12086013	eng	This is all we need.
12086014	eng	That was all we needed.
12086036	eng	I was at Chuck's Diner.
12086037	eng	Nothing could possibly go wrong.
12086063	eng	How wide is the river?
12086106	eng	Tom confessed to shooting Mary.
12086151	eng	You may speak with Tom.
12086153	eng	Tom has created a plan.
12086219	eng	Are you all still arguing?
12086241	eng	Nobody will know my name.
12086243	eng	What if Tom sees it?
12086263	eng	Get me some hot sauce.
12086268	eng	They let me pass first.
12086272	eng	Not all of us agree.
12086276	eng	I had a checkup yesterday.
12086286	eng	What was the party like?
12086287	eng	Tom is Mary's emergency contact.
12086306	eng	Tom Jackson was my mentor.
12086373	eng	Tom stashed some stuff here.
12086382	eng	I met up with Tom.
12086391	eng	Ask Tom to come outside.
12086393	eng	I poured water on Tom.
12086400	eng	Have you washed your feet?
12086401	eng	Did you wash your feet?
12086402	eng	I know Tom sent you.
12086403	eng	Dr. Jackson wants to operate.
12086406	eng	Tom hurt a few people.
12086423	eng	Did you cross the river?
12086424	eng	My heart beats for Tom.
12086432	eng	I had a chocolate sundae.
12086433	eng	Tom and Mary keep busy.
12086437	eng	Tom could have seen it.
12086465	eng	I spoke to Tom briefly.
12086525	eng	Does anyone need a spoon?
12086538	eng	Tom asked for more time.
12086562	eng	When are you having lunch?
12086627	eng	I was there for Tom.
12086633	eng	They picked dozens of pears.
12086646	eng	Nan's biscuits are the best.
12086664	eng	Caterpillars ate the tree's leaves.
12086676	eng	The room is relatively small.
12086698	eng	What was Tom here for?
12086720	eng	What a coward I am!
12086788	eng	How can we rescue Tom?
12086790	eng	This olive oil is excellent.
12086813	eng	Tom is here for us.
12086907	eng	Let me give you something.
12086910	eng	Tom hurt me very deeply.
12086911	eng	Let me borrow some cash.
12086959	eng	We have to win tomorrow.
12087001	eng	Will you write sentences tomorrow?
12087021	eng	Are you here for Tom?
12087069	eng	This is a peppermint patty.
12087073	eng	Tell Tom to keep it.
12087087	eng	This horse belongs to us.
12087141	eng	A girl named Mary drowned.
12087144	eng	Everyone knows Tom and Mary.
12087146	eng	I had a better idea.
12087151	eng	We don't have a quorum.
12087200	eng	Tom will be leaving first.
12087209	eng	I hope Tom bought it.
12087212	eng	I have to get stronger.
12087259	eng	Tell Tom what happened here.
12087269	eng	Tom lives in this forest.
12087275	eng	I heard about your afternoon.
12087346	eng	The workers have no homeland.
12087404	eng	I want to congratulate Tom.
12087408	eng	I thought you understood this.
12087534	eng	Has Tom told you anything?
12087537	eng	Why is Tom protecting you?
12087557	eng	Tom was an intelligent man.
12087635	eng	That isn't the greatest problem.
12087645	eng	Act like you always do.
12087689	eng	Tom is barbecuing a chicken.
12087727	eng	Did you have trouble sleeping?
12087903	eng	I also went to Harvard.
12087978	eng	You should ask for one.
12088086	eng	She felt dizzy and fell.
12088124	eng	We had a station wagon.
12088159	eng	I was discharged last Monday.
12088160	eng	Are you all moving away?
12088196	eng	We're coming at about two.
12088198	eng	Our deadline is October twentieth.
12088204	eng	You rest while I drive.
12088205	eng	Our lease expires in October.
12088206	eng	We live in a city.
12088207	eng	We live in a town.
12088208	eng	Your contract ends next October.
12088214	eng	Tom was shot last October.
12088218	eng	You should've come in October.
12088240	eng	Today is October the twentieth.
12088242	eng	Tom was in the cave.
12088246	eng	It didn't rain this morning.
12088259	eng	We're meeting them this afternoon.
12088260	eng	It's blazing hot here today.
12088280	eng	Now is the best time.
12088287	eng	Now is the appropriate time.
12088288	eng	Now is the perfect time.
12088290	eng	Now is the right time.
12088296	eng	Now is the wrong time.
12088337	eng	Tom asked about you today.
12088339	eng	Tom wants to hurt Mary.
12088346	eng	Tom and Mary were killed.
12088348	eng	Tom told us something else.
12088401	eng	I must go to Boston.
12088414	eng	Sing me a traditional song.
12088423	eng	You're really popular, aren't you?
12088424	eng	None of them are Canadians.
12088425	eng	All of them are Canadians.
12088445	eng	Tom came to help you.
12088472	eng	Are you talking about divorce?
12088474	eng	I spoke to Tom's parents.
12088492	eng	You were wrong about Tom.
12088493	eng	Did you get my card?
12088494	eng	Is Tom in the building?
12088520	eng	Here is my calling card.
12088536	eng	You take care of Tom.
12088539	eng	Cutting onions makes me cry.
12088542	eng	Tom may already be there.
12088559	eng	Help Tom clean the room.
12088561	eng	Tom needed a green card.
12088562	eng	I found you a studio.
12088566	eng	I need my knife back.
12088569	eng	I knew Tom quite well.
12088570	eng	That scar never did heal.
12088590	eng	You're still young and beautiful.
12088591	eng	Cross Tom off the list.
12088592	eng	They offered me a bribe.
12088602	eng	Tom hurt a little boy.
12088653	eng	Does that make you cross?
12088659	eng	It looks smart on him.
12088662	eng	It looks smart on her.
12088667	eng	It looks smart on me.
12088690	eng	Would you like another brandy?
12088698	eng	Tom was running for safety.
12088710	eng	I followed Tom down here.
12088731	eng	Did you see Tom's scar?
12088767	eng	A hammerhead shark killed Tom.
12088779	eng	I thought Tom stayed behind.
12088797	eng	Why isn't Tom behind bars?
12088906	eng	Are you ready to fight?
12088999	eng	I came here for Tom.
12089003	eng	I heard about that guy.
12089010	eng	Tom doesn't make his bed.
12089113	eng	Let me analyze the situation.
12089114	eng	Tom is an amazing chef.
12089115	eng	This forest is very dangerous.
12089138	eng	Ask Tom for some advice.
12089151	eng	Take care of my house.
12089186	eng	Did I cross the line?
12089222	eng	It hurt like the dickens.
12089346	eng	ChatGPT is an American parrot.
12089635	eng	Tom and Mary scare me.
12089685	eng	Time doesn't always heal wounds.
12089711	eng	We're planning our future together.
12089738	eng	Does Tom agree with Mary?
12089740	eng	My wish has come true.
12089747	eng	Tom sent this to us.
12089796	eng	Which one is Tom's car?
12089854	eng	Tell Tom about the picnic.
12089865	eng	Flying planes can be dangerous.
12089890	eng	Her mother was very superstitious.
12089904	eng	I found my bike broken.
12089914	eng	Have you tried this brand?
12089921	eng	I have a bad conscience.
12089985	eng	We drove through the forest.
12089994	eng	I really don't like you.
12089999	eng	Tom already knows about us.
12090023	eng	Tom hurt himself while working.
12090024	eng	Nobody knew where I was.
12090030	eng	Tom knows I did it.
12090031	eng	Does that make you afraid?
12090069	eng	Add a shot of rum.
12090070	eng	I proclaim Tom the victor.
12090094	eng	Tom had told the truth.
12090118	eng	You should get a ferret.
12090125	eng	This is a Canadian newspaper.
12090126	eng	Nobody here can help me.
12090128	eng	Tom and I were married.
12090129	eng	Let me come to you.
12090133	eng	Act 3 will be better.
12090145	eng	I think Tom is upstairs.
12090147	eng	Order some food for me.
12090151	eng	Take care of it quickly.
12090160	eng	Did you see the paintings?
12090169	eng	Tom was really burned out.
12090193	eng	Nobody knows what that means.
12090209	eng	I left it to Tom.
12090227	eng	Tom let Mary get away.
12090233	eng	Are your sons with you?
12090235	eng	You pushed Tom too far.
12090237	eng	I still barely know you.
12090317	eng	This is an amazing collection.
12090319	eng	How do we reach Tom?
12090320	eng	This is my first trip.
12090328	eng	Tom and Mary were assassins.
12090347	eng	Tom may actually like that.
12090403	eng	This was painted by Tom.
12090427	eng	They've accused Tom of trespassing.
12090442	eng	Tom was a horse thief.
12090462	eng	They asked us to come.
12090480	eng	Crying doesn't make you right.
12090520	eng	Can you stay for lunch?
12090577	eng	All children like to play.
12090605	eng	Tom died right after Mary.
12090617	eng	Did they argue with you?
12090627	eng	You may ask one question.
12090641	eng	How about checking with Tom?
12090644	eng	Will you have some brandy?
12090645	eng	Tom sprang out of bed.
12090664	eng	He is short of money.
12090672	eng	When will Henry Kissinger die?
12090678	eng	I was at the poolside.
12090710	eng	Tom ran outside stark naked.
12090735	eng	Tuaregs have a beautiful phenotype.
12090737	eng	Sahrawi women are extraordinarily stunning.
12090778	eng	What if Tom sees you?
12090799	eng	Tom may be at Mary's.
12090804	eng	We should swim for shore.
12090806	eng	I should've returned for Tom.
12090853	eng	Does he have a piano?
12090867	eng	"Why?" "I don't know why."
12090875	eng	Tell me about this forest.
12090878	eng	Tom left without telling me.
12090921	eng	Tom needed a new job.
12090923	eng	Is this thing really necessary?
12090936	eng	How was the first day?
12090997	eng	Mary doesn't shave her armpits.
12091080	eng	This may not be mine.
12091129	eng	I want Tom here now.
12091146	eng	You aren't cold, are you?
12091175	eng	He does rely on her.
12091177	eng	Tom tossed it to me.
12091180	eng	I heard about your decision.
12091271	eng	I never should've given up.
12091278	eng	I moved in with Tom.
12091280	eng	She relies on her daughter.
12091281	eng	She relies on her sister.
12091282	eng	He relies on his brothers.
12091304	eng	You'd better buy me something.
12091338	eng	I've got just one question.
12091340	eng	I have just one question.
12091341	eng	How do we contact Tom?
12091342	eng	How can we contact Tom?
12091344	eng	Tom has lost his bearings.
12091346	eng	He weighs about 21½ stone.
12091354	eng	Tom Jackson is a suspect.
12091361	eng	No further questions, your Honour.
12091374	eng	Have you read the book?
12091375	eng	Have you finished the book?
12091380	eng	Lavender is my favourite plant.
12091394	eng	People are not always reasonable.
12091425	eng	We achieved the same results.
12091426	eng	Nothing Tom did hurt me.
12091428	eng	I've had too much brandy.
12091447	eng	The air is dry today.
12091448	eng	The air today is dry.
12091463	eng	Tom did this to himself.
12091467	eng	Nobody else is doing this.
12091471	eng	I think walking is good.
12091493	eng	Oh, there was something else.
12091516	eng	We have a baby girl.
12091517	eng	Tom cost me my job.
12091531	eng	I've had the strangest cravings.
12091532	eng	I went to Chuck's Diner.
12091568	eng	I can also play clarinet.
12091571	eng	That's what Tom promised me.
12091613	eng	Did you see Tom cry?
12091614	eng	I had a bad marriage.
12091629	eng	I accidentally erased some data.
12091635	eng	I had three martinis today.
12091641	eng	Catching Tom won't be easy.
12091642	eng	This is for someone else.
12091657	eng	Where did Tom attend school?
12091682	eng	I'm trying to forget something.
12091697	eng	I want my real dad!
12091709	eng	What does Tom always say?
12091711	eng	How did things go yesterday?
12091713	eng	What is it between you?
12091754	eng	Give these tickets to Tom.
12091761	eng	I've spoken to Tom's doctors.
12091769	eng	This movie is pretty good.
12091774	eng	Did you see Tom yourself?
12091803	eng	I almost lost the game.
12091834	eng	Tom must be working late.
12091943	eng	I talked to Tom recently.
12091948	eng	I had the same impression.
12091978	eng	Come into our humble abode.
12091995	eng	She is bigger than them.
12091997	eng	Tom said somebody was coming.
12092015	eng	I love that Cajun seasoning.
12092087	eng	I checked in with Tom.
12092144	eng	I saw Tom do this.
12092167	eng	We're on a nice beach.
12092216	eng	You can stop doing this.
12092252	eng	Are you talking about happiness?
12092377	eng	I should never have surrendered.
12092447	eng	Tom can get you anything.
12092451	eng	Call back in an hour.
12092467	eng	Tom obviously makes you happy.
12092537	eng	Tom was sick this week.
12092538	eng	I needed some extra time.
12092566	eng	Mary slipped and hurt herself.
12092603	eng	Tom was trained by Mary.
12092605	eng	You could get a reward.
12092610	eng	What did my father say?
12092631	eng	My wife is also here.
12092663	eng	What a beautiful wedding dress!
12092666	eng	You're no match for me.
12092696	eng	Act like you belong here.
12092729	eng	Good morning, Mom and Dad.
12092732	eng	He was shaking with rage.
12092765	eng	I talked to Tom's teacher.
12092783	eng	I knew Tom was special.
12092833	eng	Nobody ever loved me before.
12092839	eng	I like talking to Tom.
12092859	eng	Tom hurt me even worse.
12092861	eng	I heard what I heard.
12092894	eng	Tom took care of it.
12092915	eng	Was Tom depressed about anything?
12092938	eng	Tom is the band leader.
12092958	eng	This is no ordinary trumpet.
12092998	eng	I'll keep all the money.
12092999	eng	Tom was on duty then.
12093008	eng	You really should thank Tom.
12093019	eng	It seems Tom has problems.
12093055	eng	Did Tom really murder Mary?
12093076	eng	Tom lives across the road.
12093107	eng	I had to reassure everyone.
12093197	eng	Tom may already have started.
12093198	eng	Nobody asked me to stay.
12093218	eng	I do not know anybody.
12093224	eng	Tom gave me a brandy.
12093255	eng	I heard all about that.
12093496	eng	What are you selling now?
12093627	eng	Mary really enjoyed herself today.
12093654	eng	Tom should see a doctor.
12093655	eng	I have to get sutures.
12093691	eng	She jumped on the train.
12093694	eng	I admire his aristocratic ways.
12093698	eng	She beat Tom at chess.
12093701	eng	Tom was buried at sea.
12093703	eng	Tom may have gotten injured.
12093751	eng	I ate a bacon sandwich.
12093821	eng	Are you buying or selling?
12093952	eng	People are falling into poverty.
12093956	eng	Tom is a notorious liar.
12094036	eng	Nobody saw Tom come in.
12094126	eng	Some writers go by pseudonyms.
12094230	eng	I've had three blood transfusions.
12094234	eng	I hate playing the piano.
12094273	eng	Tom and Mary were wounded.
12094276	eng	Obviously, something is bothering you.
12094279	eng	Tom's friend is named Peter.

12094282	eng	He wears a leather jacket.
12094287	eng	I didn't hear you knocking.
12094304	eng	Tom is a bit pompous.
12094341	eng	Tom and Mary were yelling.
12094375	eng	I guess that Tom understands.
12094385	eng	Welcome to being a mother.
12094394	eng	You look nothing like me.

12094992	eng	I have my dog here.
12094997	eng	Tom ate the whole pizza.
12095006	eng	Let me borrow that hammer.
12095017	eng	Tomorrow, everything will be forgotten.
12095025	eng	I had a nice salad.

12095763	eng	Are you bringing anyone tomorrow?

12096534	eng	Why do I have it?

12109234	eng	Tom, do you feel sick?
12109244	eng	I had work in Boston.
12109417	eng	Tom's concert was really good.
12109431	eng	Pyromania is a mental disorder.
12109532	eng	I had a bad lawyer.
12109547	eng	Admission is only one dollar.
12109558	eng	Tom needs a new job.
12109560	eng	All the windows face south.
12109561	eng	I've got to leave now.
12109562	eng	How long is the road?
12109575	eng	I checked it out today.
12109579	eng	I had a blindfold on.
12109597	eng	I had a bad audition.
12109602	eng	Tom is my foster brother.
12109627	eng	She will never lead again.
12109640	eng	We are renovating old homes.
12109650	eng	Is she related to you?
12109670	eng	I'm honored to meet you.
12109673	eng	Where did Tom fit in?
12109681	eng	Nobody here wrote anything else.
12109682	eng	Did Tom hit you again?
12109685	eng	I heard about the accident.
12109701	eng	Accidents are bound to happen.
12109702	eng	Tom got on his knees.
12109712	eng	Accidents happen to us all.
12109728	eng	Tom just got married again.
12109729	eng	I had a previous commitment.
12109735	eng	What was Tom referring to?
12109738	eng	I miss Tom and Mary.
12109760	eng	I have nothing against kissing.
12109777	eng	Dr. Jackson will see you.

12109851	eng	We settled for a draw.
12109852	eng	Tom killed his own brother.
12109875	eng	These songs are very popular.
12109900	eng	I have a class tomorrow.
12109908	eng	Who was that old lady?
12109909	eng	Did Tom go with Mary?
12109912	eng	I'm feeling overwhelmed with stress.

12109927	eng	One minus one equals zero.
12109943	eng	Tom found someone to marry.
12110014	eng	That probably belongs to Tom.
12110016	eng	Tom quickly left the bar.
12110020	eng	Tom quickly left the office.
12110034	eng	Did Mary have a boyfriend?
12110078	eng	This looks like third-degree frostbite.
12110087	eng	Why is Tom so tall?
12110243	eng	I had a ball today.
12110296	eng	I prefer to live authentically.
12110346	eng	Nobody has found anything yet.
12110483	eng	Does Tom still take pictures?
12110516	eng	I just got to Boston.
12110519	eng	I spoke to Tom here.
12110562	eng	I have limited financial resources.
12110574	eng	I travel during off-peak seasons.

12110672	eng	I met Christine here yesterday.
12110792	eng	Tomorrow I'll start a diet.

12110800	eng	Today I will not smoke.
12110868	eng	I heard all about it.
12110943	eng	I heard a loud thud.
12110946	eng	Why didn't you text me?
12110967	eng	We found his suicide note.
12110980	eng	I learn from past experiences.
12110988	eng	Tom is entering the building.
12110996	eng	I have a firm mattress.
12111020	eng	Put on your Sunday best.
12111067	eng	I can't get a pulse.

12111129	eng	I didn't see anything moving.
12111132	eng	Tom has a charming smile.
12111155	eng	The search function doesn't work.

12111192	eng	Does Tom pay you enough?
12111329	eng	Did Tom have any problems?
12111337	eng	Has anyone seen my clarinet?
12111352	eng	This is our best brandy.
12111368	eng	Tom has already contacted Mary.
12111375	eng	I found strength within myself.
12111416	eng	Tom may not be qualified.
12111435	eng	Luis very quickly learnt Berber.
12111468	eng	I have a bum leg.
12111472	eng	Bail is set at $300,000.
12111507	eng	How do the marigolds look?
12111522	eng	Luis put his headphones on.
12111525	eng	Our children are in trouble.
12111533	eng	Tom was asking for forgiveness.
12111545	eng	Luis had a map, too.
12111551	eng	Luis hasn't got any petrol.
12111578	eng	The village was burnt down.
12111594	eng	Luis spoke to the doll.
12111597	eng	I re-emerged stronger than before.
12111598	eng	Did the doll say that?
12111618	eng	This is only a doll.
12111634	eng	The doll is at home.
12111644	eng	Luis came for his doll.
12111653	eng	The doll was there again.
12111663	eng	Luis sat up in bed.
12111680	eng	Luis heard a loud cry.

12111739	eng	We took a bus here.
12111789	eng	I left Tom with Mary.
12111829	eng	We got home at two-thirty.
12111837	eng	Tom decided to drop by.
12111925	eng	Did Tom write this himself?
12111996	eng	Perseverance became my greatest asset.
12112051	eng	It drove me towards success.
12112140	eng	Tom always ran from responsibility.
12112238	eng	This is a Canadian custom.
12112246	eng	I had a beautiful day.
12112266	eng	Tom made me angry again.
12112301	eng	Help Tom find the document.
12112303	eng	Should we call the police?
12112355	eng	Could you watch the children?
12112362	eng	I noticed Tom was restless.

12112439	eng	Tom can wait till tomorrow.
12112455	eng	Tom couldn't watch it anymore.

12112676	eng	This is my daughter Mary.
12112679	eng	Tom wants to hurt us.
12112832	eng	Normally, we do this alone.
12112839	eng	Does it really bother you?
12112866	eng	Was that useful to you?
12112921	eng	Was Tom drinking last night?
12112947	eng	I heard about the investigation.

12112956	eng	Mites are a paraphyletic group.
12112961	eng	Tom is a big cheese.

12112988	eng	I got a birthmark removed.
12113019	eng	I have a chicken farm.
12113023	eng	I must've missed that episode.
12113044	eng	What Tom did irritated Mary.
12113062	eng	Guess whose boyfriend that is.
12113073	eng	I'm meditating in the forest.
12113074	eng	Could you watch the dogs?

12113429	eng	He was there that day.
12113433	eng	It's fine as it is.
12113468	eng	We shouldn't have come here.

12113568	eng	They're still hesitant to attack.
12113571	eng	Human language is extremely complex.
12113590	eng	They took down the hashtag.
12113598	eng	The channel undermined its reputation.
12113602	eng	Everything is unfolding before us.
12113603	eng	We need to retweet this.
12113607	eng	They don't represent our position.

12122749	eng	Did you accept that job?
12122789	eng	You know it's Halloween, right?
12122833	eng	Tom is a little conceited.
12122850	eng	You're even prettier in person.
12122854	eng	Perhaps I should contact Tom.
12122856	eng	Are you all in line?
12122861	eng	I began to hate Tom.
12122883	eng	You'll get your money back.

12129391	eng	Halloween is a secular holiday.
12129395	eng	Halloween is my favorite holiday.
12129406	eng	I used to love Halloween.
12129409	eng	Do you have Halloween plans?
12129414	eng	I forgot it was Halloween.
12129424	eng	I thought you hated Halloween.
12129426	eng	What'll you do on Halloween?
12129452	eng	Halloween has become very commercialized.
12129561	eng	What do you do well?
12129609	eng	Wake up. It's very late.
12129696	eng	Buy flowers for your wife.
12129738	eng	You've missed a belt loop.
12129744	eng	I have a Jewish nose.
12129747	eng	The goat is an atheist.
12129751	eng	Tell it to the judge.
12129780	eng	What's your worst bad habit?
12129783	eng	Have you ever stolen something?
12129841	eng	I'm originally from up north.
12129842	eng	I'm used to trusting people.
12129933	eng	Why was Tom following Mary?
12130018	eng	Tom is a Harvard alum.
12130062	eng	Tom insisted on coming in.
12130088	eng	I'm anxious about the result.
12130092	eng	Wasn't Halloween great this year?
12130096	eng	That scar looks very bad.
12130099	eng	I got sick on Halloween.
12130101	eng	See you guys on Halloween.
12130102	eng	Tom was born on Halloween.
12130105	eng	Halloween is coming up fast.
12130106	eng	I hate working on Halloween.
12130107	eng	I forgot all about Halloween.
12130108	eng	Tell me more about Halloween.
12130110	eng	I thought you liked Halloween.
12130111	eng	You must really like Halloween.
12130112	eng	Everyone loves a Halloween party.
12130114	eng	I found some Halloween decorations.
12130118	eng	Tom had something you wanted.
12130123	eng	How did dance rehearsal go?
12130128	eng	Welcome to my Halloween party.
12130133	eng	He must obey his father.
12130144	eng	Are you selling your jewellery?
12130145	eng	There's mould on the walls.
12130168	eng	Let me briefly explain it.
12130179	eng	That restaurant serves grilled salmon.
12130183	eng	Where am I to go?
12130185	eng	It was a good one.
12130186	eng	Let me be the one.
12130199	eng	That couldn't possibly be true.
12130202	eng	Tom knew he was alone.
12130203	eng	I'm quite an old man.
12130208	eng	I'm as poor as you.
12130209	eng	I had a brain tumor.
12130212	eng	I told Tom so myself.
12130214	eng	Let me see your face.
12130219	eng	His guilty feelings wore off.
12130226	eng	Hey, I can help you!
12130227	eng	You're free to do so.
12130233	eng	Why are you so foolish?
12130234	eng	It's not far by car.
12130240	eng	Was Tom a prisoner, too?
12130245	eng	It's no business of mine.
12130250	eng	Tell me what's wrong now.
12130254	eng	You may get into trouble.
12130255	eng	You might get into trouble.
12130259	eng	I treated myself to it.
12130267	eng	Tom is up to mischief.
12130268	eng	Would you rather be alone?
12130269	eng	Would you rather I leave?
12130275	eng	You're now one of us.
12130280	eng	You'd better go, I think.
12130288	eng	There's nothing to fear now.
12130298	eng	The heat is punishing us.
12130299	eng	Carry Tom into the house.
12130305	eng	They're afraid we might know.
12130312	eng	What did you bring today?
12130314	eng	He wants to hit him.
12130322	eng	I'd rather eat by myself.
12130356	eng	That isn't Tom, is it?
12130388	eng	The crowd is dispersing now.
12130402	eng	We'll soon land in Boston.
12130440	eng	The play was very short.
12130444	eng	Tom didn't have any daughters.
12130448	eng	I want to get away.
12130453	eng	I can't breathe in here.
12130455	eng	I didn't expect any help.
12130456	eng	I have seen Tom here.
12130472	eng	I thought that was hysterical.
12130473	eng	Mary came home by herself.
12130474	eng	Who designed these Halloween costumes?
12130479	eng	Tom seldom leaves his room.
12130495	eng	You can buy wine here.
12130500	eng	I don't feel quite myself.
12130505	eng	The floor was very slippery.
12130517	eng	Did Tom leave anything here?
12130524	eng	It might be almost anything.
12130532	eng	I shouldn't have permitted it.
12130559	eng	Mary is now a widow.
12130561	eng	Whatever pleases you, pleases me.
12130591	eng	Don't leave your room unlocked.
12130637	eng	What shall I cook today?
12130707	eng	He didn't go to Shanghai.
12130715	eng	Tom is making his move.
12130722	eng	That was pretty clever, Tom.
12130749	eng	Are you really Tom Jackson?
12130752	eng	Welcome to my little home.
12130755	eng	I had to find Tom.
12130784	eng	Tom has hurt somebody else.
12130852	eng	I have the same concern.
12130854	eng	I would never hit Tom.
12130855	eng	You could get a ticket.
12130952	eng	Does Tom sleep a lot?
12130962	eng	That's the best Halloween costume.
12131094	eng	A package arrived from Australia.
12131141	eng	Act like a grown man.
12131142	eng	Tom was a social worker.
12131176	eng	Tomorrow could be too late.
12131193	eng	They stole everything from him.
12131201	eng	I plant an orange tree.
12131259	eng	Are you Tom's oldest son?
12131267	eng	Tom gave me this idea.
12131279	eng	Is that your Halloween costume?
12131318	eng	They wanted to kill me.
12131327	eng	The elephant ate some bananas.
12131338	eng	You need to do it.
12131418	eng	Take this to my house.
12131423	eng	Tom is a Canadian pilot.
12131468	eng	Dad robbed a petrol station.
12131531	eng	She sat in the backseat.
12131648	eng	Are you ready to rock?
12131683	eng	Tom barely got out alive.
12131688	eng	This isn't a Halloween costume.
12131701	eng	I want to help somehow.
12131805	eng	Call Tom to the phone.
12131858	eng	Trolleybuses used to run here.
12131878	eng	Tom has almost no accent.
12131895	eng	I was a disobedient child.
12131944	eng	You should have said so.
12132002	eng	Are you thinking about leaving?
12132005	eng	Are you all Tom's friends?
12132010	eng	What should I cook today?
12132027	eng	Drink some wine with us.
12132034	eng	Nice to meet you, Tom.
12132042	eng	I never did like Tom.
12132068	eng	Tom made you a cake.
12132105	eng	Did Mary make that herself?
12132127	eng	Do you have the passports?
12132131	eng	How could Tom hurt Mary?
12132133	eng	Aren't you excited about Halloween?
12132134	eng	I had a bad teacher.
12132136	eng	Welcome to our support group.
12132175	eng	I took it from Tom.
12132195	eng	We may all be killed.
12132198	eng	I know you saw Tom.
12132210	eng	This is my friend Tom.
12132224	eng	Thank you for the brandy.
12132234	eng	Who am I to you?
12132369	eng	Tom could perhaps answer that.
12132426	eng	Tom gave me these earrings.
12132454	eng	Are you all getting along?
12132471	eng	That dude looks like Tom.
12132475	eng	Have you heard anything further?
12132501	eng	Is your father a barber?
12132508	eng	Don't you just hate Halloween?
12132534	eng	I had a bad tire.
12132536	eng	I already have a clarinet.
12132537	eng	Did you fight with Tom?
12132558	eng	How did you sleep, Tom?
12132589	eng	Did you order a brandy?
12132591	eng	I had a boyfriend then.
12132594	eng	Was last October this bad?
12132611	eng	You used to love Halloween.
12132633	eng	Tell us about that night.
12132695	eng	Chuck's Diner closes at eight.
12132841	eng	What'll you tell your parents?
12132845	eng	I hate talking about Tom.
12132863	eng	Tom was unruly in class.
12132875	eng	I had the asparagus soup.
12132887	eng	A Canadian guy helped me.
12132896	eng	Someday you will understand everything.
12132921	eng	Tom Jackson is a senator.
12132946	eng	Welcome Tom to our team.
12132952	eng	Tell Tom about what happened.
12132956	eng	I'm looking for Halloween candy.
12132987	eng	This is kind of dangerous.
12132991	eng	Tom came here with Mary.
12133008	eng	The elevator has green walls.
12133016	eng	There is an anthill here.
12133024	eng	Tom said Mary wanted tacos.
12133042	eng	Our story begins in 2013.
12133043	eng	Tom will rebuild the wall.
12133058	eng	That money belonged to Tom.
12133075	eng	Was Tom wearing a wire?
12133081	eng	Tom is organising a seminar.
12133091	eng	Tom looks kind of blue.
12133096	eng	I want to help now.
12133098	eng	I noticed Tom was flustered.
12133104	eng	We have to get going.
12133106	eng	You can meet me tomorrow.
12133125	eng	I'm graduating in three months.
12133154	eng	I bought several Halloween masks.
12133165	eng	Are you already feeling better?
12133204	eng	I used to be Catholic.
12133211	eng	Wait until Tom relieves himself.
12133227	eng	Welcome to my new apartment.
12133230	eng	Throw Tom off the boat.
12133242	eng	Let's throw a Halloween party.
12133271	eng	Tom doesn't believe in destiny.
12133274	eng	Did you get Tom out?
12133297	eng	Tom took a bold step.
12133300	eng	I'll eat after Tom leaves.
12133306	eng	You'll do whatever you want.
12133314	eng	Nobody ever does that anymore.
12133326	eng	Has Tom seen Mary recently?
12133436	eng	I was sparing your feelings.
12133446	eng	Tom has already said no.
12133448	eng	Are you excited about Halloween?
12133516	eng	Tom and Mary actually cooperated.
12133518	eng	Did you find my luggage?
12133534	eng	How did Tom fit in?
12133540	eng	Perhaps Tom can drive you.
12133542	eng	I actually don't celebrate Halloween.
12133693	eng	Tom runs the soup kitchen.
12133745	eng	How could Tom hate Mary?
12133781	eng	Draw me a large circle.
12133790	eng	I heard Tom got busted.
12133793	eng	I should've never given up.
12133796	eng	Mary can easily support herself.
12133852	eng	Our friends are in trouble.
12133895	eng	Tom has a great mind.
12133917	eng	We have a flat tyre.
12133974	eng	Wise as you might be.
12133983	eng	This will be over tonight.
12133997	eng	Tom has some expensive toys.
12134028	eng	Put water in the vase.
12134029	eng	You need to stay ready.
12134031	eng	I think Tom is quicker.
12134033	eng	This is a bit overcooked.
12134047	eng	Are you Tom and Mary?
12134049	eng	My daughter often visits me.
12134051	eng	Tom is with us today.
12134106	eng	I've only got twenty euros.
12134107	eng	I only have twenty euros.
12134108	eng	I've got just twenty euros.
12134111	eng	Accidents occur all the time.
12134112	eng	Tom is our best waiter.
12134116	eng	The park is thickly wooded.
12134126	eng	Tom is still up there.
12134129	eng	Could I talk to Tom?
12134140	eng	Do you get paid enough?
12134142	eng	Take care of yourself, Tom.
12134158	eng	Are you talking about cheating?
12134169	eng	Halloween is a magical night.
12134171	eng	Halloween was three days ago.
12134173	eng	Halloween is three months away.
12134177	eng	Strange things happen on Halloween.
12134186	eng	I drive a blue van.
12134193	eng	I did what Tom did.
12134194	eng	Are you still taking medicine?
12134206	eng	That must be Tom's stuff.
12134225	eng	Tom passed away years ago.
12134236	eng	Have I not made sacrifices?
12134238	eng	Tom missed an important call.
12134240	eng	This is my girlfriend, Mary.
12134242	eng	Let me borrow some money.
12134245	eng	I saw Tom this afternoon.
12134265	eng	We got back home safely.
12134273	eng	Tom and Mary split up.
12134277	eng	Now, say it in French.
12134279	eng	I heard about it tonight.
12134284	eng	Nobody gave me any food.
12134288	eng	That made a big difference.
12134289	eng	I need to meet Tom.
12134296	eng	I have a Canadian husband.
12134302	eng	I have a baby brother.
12134308	eng	Welcome to my humble home.
12134318	eng	It might possibly be cancer.
12134321	eng	Did you see Tom's car?
12134323	eng	Nobody there liked me much.
12134328	eng	Wasn't today your day off?
12134331	eng	That joke was so cringe!
12134351	eng	What does Tom always do?
12134388	eng	This coffee is pretty good.
12134392	eng	I saw someone kill Tom.
12134394	eng	Tom is a professional player.
12134421	eng	Tom is strange these days.
12134453	eng	I pretended to be wounded.
12134461	eng	How much does Tom know?
12134464	eng	Tom has some great toys.
12134473	eng	Where does Tom attend school?
12134478	eng	Tom, do you know Mary?
12134494	eng	Tell Tom we're very sorry.
12134603	eng	I checked into a motel.
12134687	eng	I had the same doubts.
12134692	eng	Pretend to be my girlfriend.
12134765	eng	Does Tom approve of this?
12134778	eng	Albert Memmi's mother was Berber.
12134812	eng	Are you talking about Canadians?
12134920	eng	Where is Tom this weekend?
12134987	eng	All these belong to Tom.
12135109	eng	I spent time with Tom.
12135120	eng	Why are you so unfortunate?
12135295	eng	What's most important to you?
12135371	eng	That's how Tom wanted it.
12135559	eng	I'm too busy to come.
12135572	eng	This sentence has a mistake.
12135575	eng	I finished eating this cake.
12135580	eng	Hide behind those boxes there.
12135599	eng	Where could the money be?
12135610	eng	Everybody will stay on shore.
12135613	eng	Hello, is Mr. Freeman here?
12135622	eng	Does Tom make you nervous?
12135627	eng	Does Tom ever get mad?
12135629	eng	Do you want some cheesecake?
12135646	eng	Nobody asks me for anything.
12135651	eng	Tom is still the manager.
12135681	eng	Our housekeeper doesn't speak English.
12135683	eng	Our housekeeper stole from us.
12135712	eng	This wine is pretty good.
12135717	eng	Tom offered Mary another drink.
12135751	eng	Are you all here together?
12135762	eng	We bought a square bed.
12135849	eng	Laura rests on her laurels.
12135855	eng	Lawrence rests on his laurels.
12135884	eng	Tom is going to eat.
12136176	eng	You should be more humble.
12136185	eng	Halloween is a pagan holiday.
12136207	eng	Halloween is celebrated in October.
12136263	eng	Tom never once mentioned Mary.
12136474	eng	Tom was our dog walker.
12136676	eng	Did your dream become reality?
12136677	eng	Did you realize your dreams?
12136680	eng	Eggs are round, not square.
12136727	eng	Are you talking about yourself?
12136755	eng	Mary could do that herself.
12136798	eng	He threw stones at us.
12136803	eng	Are you originally from Boston?
12136999	eng	Dagestan has a volatile history.
12137192	eng	Ann is the cheerleading captain.
12137239	eng	Can you still do it?
12137260	eng	You are in the hospital.
12137261	eng	Normally, people ask more questions.
12137270	eng	Tom got the jewels back.
12137283	eng	Guess where I am now.
12137298	eng	This contract takes effect tomorrow.
12137374	eng	Dr. Jackson saved my life.
12137411	eng	I'm my gran's only granddaughter.
12137414	eng	Fewer trains run at night.
12137418	eng	Take those football boots off.
12137420	eng	Anna deserves all the credit.
12137422	eng	When will you grow up?
12137427	eng	Has the data been analyzed?
12137443	eng	We stayed at home today.
12137455	eng	I went to find Tom.
12137516	eng	The weather really is lovely.
12137517	eng	That noise is annoying me.
12137520	eng	I fully agree with Tom.
12137533	eng	What's the purpose of this?
12137541	eng	Don't walk across the tracks!
12137556	eng	Our protests were in vain.
12137558	eng	Is it within walking distance?
12137576	eng	Many thanks for your interest.
12137591	eng	Why didn't anyone inform me?
12137616	eng	I'll write to my family.
12137799	eng	This website is under construction.
12137887	eng	Tom and Mary are incompatible.
12137911	eng	I must cooperate with Tom.
12137934	eng	Tom sent us a message.
12137952	eng	That taught me a lot.
12138121	eng	Everything is within walking distance.
12138142	eng	Obviously, it was a mistake.
12138158	eng	She entered through the window.
12138244	eng	Welcome to my hiding place.
12138247	eng	When are they getting married?
12138346	eng	Marginalized people are traumatized people.
12138349	eng	I've brought my own cutlery.
12138362	eng	Avoid further harming traumatized people.
12138381	eng	I never liked you, Tom.
12138453	eng	I'm getting evicted in October.
12138532	eng	Tom and Mary are socialists.
12138740	eng	The accident could've been worse.
12138763	eng	Chuck's Diner has closed down.
12138838	eng	This place is very sacred.
12138839	eng	Did she use Kabyle proverbs?
12138961	eng	Tom probably complained about me.
12138983	eng	The water here tastes terrible.
12139013	eng	Tom was a tail gunner.
12139017	eng	There aren't any more tickets.
12139073	eng	Fate was kind to me.
12139089	eng	We've been hiking since dawn.
12139095	eng	Nobody seemed to notice me.
12139110	eng	Tom is an escaped murderer.
12139111	eng	I guess that can wait.
12139118	eng	I wish I was Tom.
12139119	eng	I wish I were Tom.
12139125	eng	I really only told Tom.
12139172	eng	I've spent all my savings.
12139210	eng	Tom may never forgive you.
12139257	eng	Tom says Mary is upset.

12139725	eng	Learning languages is my hobby.
12139766	eng	I'm very sensitive to noise.
12139810	eng	I want you here now.
12139940	eng	I have to forgive myself.
12140010	eng	I spoke to Tom harshly.
12140145	eng	This is an expensive brandy.
12140199	eng	Who are your social supports?
12140217	eng	Are you safe and comfortable?
12140290	eng	Don't touch my stuff, please.
12140393	eng	I heard you're from Boston.
12140417	eng	What does Tom actually do?
12140427	eng	Smoking prohibited on the train.
12140440	eng	Have they found the murderer?
12140481	eng	What a beautiful engagement ring!
12140592	eng	I try not to snore.
12140654	eng	They took Tom into safety.
12140738	eng	Was Tom a good soldier?
12140760	eng	Tom is a reckless guy.
12140778	eng	My Google account is hacked.
12140779	eng	My Google account was hacked.
12140786	eng	I have a client waiting.
12140802	eng	It takes two to quarrel.
12140850	eng	Take a sip of brandy.
12140878	eng	Tom was petrified with fear.
12140880	eng	I should be more understanding.
12140883	eng	I have nothing against working.
12140892	eng	All these people know Tom.
12140900	eng	I have to get tested.
12140906	eng	Tom said he helped Mary.
12140912	eng	Do I have sane ego?
12140926	eng	I happen to hate basketball.
12140930	eng	I feel better for now.
12140939	eng	Does Tom come here frequently?
12140950	eng	That bloke stole my wallet.
12140965	eng	Did you find any witnesses?
12140970	eng	I knew Tom would call.
12140975	eng	Can Tom do that yet?
12141002	eng	Trust me. I'm a politician.
12141066	eng	I should've noticed it sooner.
12141101	eng	Mary's giving Tom a rollicking.
12141115	eng	When will you ring me?
12141116	eng	When will you phone me?
12141117	eng	When are you ringing me?
12141118	eng	When are you phoning me?
12141128	eng	His efforts produced no results.
12141129	eng	His efforts came to nothing.
12141133	eng	I heard a loud voice.
12141138	eng	My heart's beating very fast.
12141149	eng	What were his last words?
12141179	eng	Hasn't anyone seen it yet?
12141210	eng	She was living with us.
12141472	eng	I'm not going down there.
12141499	eng	Ambulances were set on fire.
12141602	eng	Was Tom here that night?
12141660	eng	Get out of the pool.
12141694	eng	Are you still studying geology?
12141751	eng	I work the night shift.
12141845	eng	Have you called a repairman?
12141846	eng	Did you call a repairman?
12141878	eng	Say hello to the boys.
12141960	eng	What was Tom guilty of?
12141965	eng	Are you all scaredy cats?
12142037	eng	Did he argue with you?
12142063	eng	Don't ask me about Tom.
12142103	eng	I caught him stealing money.
12142204	eng	I started getting tired recently.
12142218	eng	Tom and Mary already know.
12142233	eng	Maybe this is an omen.
12142390	eng	It looks like they're fighting.
12142517	eng	Does Tom know about me?
12142564	eng	Did you accept Tom's apology?
12142565	eng	Did you accept Tom's offer?
12142566	eng	Did you do that deliberately?
12142577	eng	Have you written it down?
12142595	eng	Tom and Mary weren't listening.
12142599	eng	Did you do the dishes?
12142618	eng	Admission is only a buck.
12142634	eng	The storm could've been worse.
12142661	eng	In wine, there is truth.
12142700	eng	Tom Jackson needs no introduction.
12142739	eng	Good food requires good company.
12142743	eng	Tom and John are wrestling.
12142752	eng	Tom said to drink it.
12142783	eng	I don't like the police.
12142841	eng	Tom is an amazing child.
12142863	eng	This data may be corrupted.
12142878	eng	My mood can change quickly.
12142883	eng	Actually, Tom was quite charming.
12142914	eng	She stared at the painting.
12142915	eng	He stared at the painting.

12142951	eng	We're not travelling into Vienna.
12142952	eng	We're not going into Vienna.
12142956	eng	This is a deep lake.
12142974	eng	My flat is very untidy.
12142976	eng	It is their own responsibility.
12142982	eng	Tom abandoned his own parents.
12142985	eng	I woke up at 5am.
12142996	eng	She just waved her hand.
12143005	eng	The concert will start soon.
12143006	eng	The concert will begin soon.
12143022	eng	She's quite an active person.
12143082	eng	She is not your enemy.
12143139	eng	I knew Tom had left.
12143251	eng	I promised nothing would happen.
12143316	eng	The wine is really good.
12143364	eng	The writer is drinking wine.
12143488	eng	When were you with Tom?
12143536	eng	Tom is still in trouble.
12143537	eng	Are your nephews working today?
12143538	eng	She will like the wine.
12143539	eng	Italy is a wine-producing country.
12143558	eng	Tom will be there too.
12143564	eng	I prefer wine to beer.
12143568	eng	I would like some wine.
12143622	eng	You sound like everyone else.
12143689	eng	Tom is a bounty hunter.
12143692	eng	Wendy's is a burger place.
12143693	eng	Were you pulling my leg?
12143717	eng	What's more important than money?
12143745	eng	Some grownups are pretty cool.
12143748	eng	There are no grownups here.
12143755	eng	Where are all the grownups?
12143758	eng	Some grownups act like children.
12143777	eng	I heard about that girl.
12143804	eng	Did you take any medicine?
12143805	eng	Did you take some medicine?
12143823	eng	You should take your medicine.
12143824	eng	You take too much medicine.
12143882	eng	Tom gave me this fish.
12143903	eng	Tom knows what poverty means.
12143907	eng	Tom revealed his decayed teeth.
12143986	eng	I heard about your divorce.
12144000	eng	Tom is also a deacon.
12144001	eng	His children give him hope.
12144004	eng	That's something you should do.
12144008	eng	I promise nothing will happen.
12144023	eng	Are you busy this afternoon?
12144086	eng	I climbed the olive tree.
12144098	eng	I had three blood transfusions.
12144138	eng	Youba has a new bike.
12144166	eng	Her children give her hope.
12144167	eng	Tom has something to do.
12144187	eng	Sing along with me now.
12144234	eng	Tom turned into a vampire.
12144278	eng	Have I not mentioned that?
12144299	eng	I was a foster kid.
12144318	eng	Tom needs a green card.
12144331	eng	Perhaps Tom had it wrong.
12144387	eng	I had the weirdest dream.
12144395	eng	Tom is a qualified psychologist.
12144427	eng	Would you care for brandy?
12144472	eng	I understand Tom is inside.
12144544	eng	Did you see the photo?
12144660	eng	You are my only interest.
12144724	eng	Help Tom get cleaned up.
12144728	eng	I had them all fired.
12144748	eng	It was my own choice.
12144851	eng	Have your brothers returned home?
12144860	eng	The cheetah runs very fast.
12144979	eng	I have the same doubts.
12145019	eng	I heard about Mary's boyfriends.
12145025	eng	I had an audition today.
12145044	eng	The protestors are demanding autonomy.
12145143	eng	That must be Tom's roommate.
12145201	eng	I threw the trash away.
12145382	eng	Would you mind telephoning Tom?
12145386	eng	How about some more brandy?
12145436	eng	Was Tom talking with Mary?
12145610	eng	I had the winning hand.
12145649	eng	Tom was the first victim.
12145650	eng	I talked to a priest.
12145729	eng	Tom would never betray me.
12145774	eng	You and Tom were right.
12145837	eng	I forget everything that happened.
12145841	eng	We forget everything that happened.
12145849	eng	You forget everything that happened.
12145854	eng	They forget everything that happened.
12145872	eng	What if Tom shows up?
12145878	eng	Can you tell me why?
12146033	eng	I have a checking account.
12146062	eng	She was my daughter, too.
12146083	eng	Don't worry. I will be.
12146193	eng	You look like an ogre.
12146219	eng	We came to encourage Tom.
12146256	eng	Don't complain. You wanted that.
12146266	eng	Are you all fully prepared?
12146281	eng	He helped me, you didn't.
12146293	eng	Tom helped, but Mary didn't.
12146303	eng	Tom was a heroin addict.
12146309	eng	Guess what else I saw.
12146340	eng	Are you all happy here?
12146342	eng	Do you know Ferhat Mehenni?
12146354	eng	Take care of this here.
12146356	eng	We're learning about aseptic packaging.
12146360	eng	Regulations are written in blood.
12146393	eng	It's too cold in here.
12146414	eng	I know you saw that.
12146461	eng	Guess what's in my wallet.
12146487	eng	That chicken was very tasty.
12146489	eng	Where did Tom find you?
12146495	eng	I heard Tom hurt Mary.
12146496	eng	Are you talking about magic?
12146507	eng	Tom is just a businessman.
12146576	eng	I bet Tom loses today.
12146585	eng	We usually do this alone.
12146619	eng	Don't fritter your life away.
12146623	eng	The Biden family is corrupt.
12146661	eng	Were you afraid of Tom?
12146676	eng	May I kiss your wife?
12146721	eng	We moved to Boston together.
12146754	eng	This is my special recipe.
12146797	eng	The mayor received enthusiastic applause.
12146812	eng	Tom is always the same.
12146861	eng	Have you two ever dated?
12146862	eng	Have you two ever kissed?
12146865	eng	Have you two been quarreling?
12146875	eng	When will this rain clear?
12146897	eng	I have not said everything.
12146898	eng	I did not say everything.
12146900	eng	It's the football match tomorrow.
12146906	eng	We have not said everything.
12146907	eng	We did not say everything.
12146912	eng	They have not said everything.
12146913	eng	They did not say everything.
12146953	eng	Tom bought an unregistered gun.
12147005	eng	The boss has just left.
12147010	eng	Do you fancy doing something?
12147020	eng	They sheltered under a tree.
12147027	eng	We sheltered under a tree.
12147040	eng	Tom will show you out.
12147046	eng	Would you prefer a cocktail?
12147101	eng	Haven't you saved any money?
12147135	eng	Both of them were arrested.
12147137	eng	That must have been Tom.
12147140	eng	How much did you donate?
12147143	eng	Do you regret not leaving?
12147177	eng	I think I know Tom.
12147288	eng	This was done by Tom.
12147460	eng	My husband likes Japanese cars.
12147463	eng	I'm interested in that, too.
12147510	eng	Let's get back to reality.
12147709	eng	The walls support the ceiling.
12147760	eng	I always did like Tom.
12147809	eng	I like everything he does.
12147810	eng	I like everything she does.
12147836	eng	Tom is our best clarinetist.
12147844	eng	I had the car checked.
12147893	eng	We did not warn them.
12147898	eng	We did not warn him.
12147912	eng	She did not warn you.
12147934	eng	You don't deserve this, Tom.
12147991	eng	Did you find a hammer?
12148016	eng	Give this envelope to Tom.
12148037	eng	Tom didn't deserve that promotion.
12148101	eng	Quit comparing me to Tom.
12148134	eng	It’s not that obvious, actually.
12148158	eng	Tom hurt me that day.
12148160	eng	How well am I doing?
12148229	eng	Could you explain that again?
12148277	eng	You need to stop Tom.
12148300	eng	You've crossed the line, Tom.
12148338	eng	Tom never buys me anything.
12148339	eng	You aren't following the rules.
12148464	eng	Is Tom going to lose?
12148499	eng	Look at the beautiful girl.
12148516	eng	I must see Tom immediately.
12148518	eng	Let me borrow your hammer.
12148578	eng	Tom has completed his book.
12148580	eng	I found a rusty nail.
12148606	eng	Let me call you later.
12148643	eng	They bathed in the sea.
12148649	eng	The doctors examined the X-ray.
12148752	eng	Tom may wake up soon.
12148855	eng	Your behaviour is your identity.
12148889	eng	This is a Canadian drink.
12148915	eng	I like everything Tom does.
12148921	eng	Do you want some honey?
12148998	eng	I guess it's pretty weird.
12149018	eng	What do you value most?
12149028	eng	Tom and Mary are acquainted.
12149030	eng	What are you stalling for?
12149047	eng	Tom will find you anywhere.
12149048	eng	Tom can find you anywhere.
12149065	eng	Tom can hear a little.
12149102	eng	People need community and connection.
12149127	eng	Tom disagrees with his diagnosis.
12149139	eng	What makes you feel safe?
12149140	eng	What makes you feel unsafe?
12149173	eng	I know you saw us.
12149321	eng	What Tom did wasn't effective.
12149386	eng	I had a better plan.
12149393	eng	Look how skinny Tom is.
12149395	eng	I found this to wear.
12149419	eng	This will bring you luck.
12149432	eng	Our daughter plays the flute.
12149463	eng	Tom drank too much brandy.
12149485	eng	Should I shut the window?
12149520	eng	Cast iron is quite heavy.
12149538	eng	Do you like apple brandy?
12149558	eng	I was roommates with Tom.
12149564	eng	Add a pinch of oregano.
12149816	eng	Mary did this to herself.
12149817	eng	I have gifts for everyone.
12149819	eng	Are you all warmed up?
12149846	eng	This is my sleeping bag.
12149885	eng	Politics is hypocrisy and scam.
12149901	eng	That hurt quite a lot.
12149915	eng	Does Tom work around here?
12149932	eng	There might be another way.
12149933	eng	That might make things worse.
12149934	eng	Is what he said true?
12149935	eng	Is what she says true?
12149937	eng	Is what she said true?
12149939	eng	When will you be away?
12149944	eng	Show him where it is.
12149946	eng	Show me where it is.
12149947	eng	Show us where it is.
12149949	eng	Show her where it is.
12150004	eng	Lions don't miaow, they roar.
12150028	eng	The meeting lasts until midday.
12150029	eng	The meeting lasts until noon.
12150040	eng	Tom had only one eye.
12150062	eng	Let me ask someone else.
12150064	eng	I rarely eat before noon.
12150088	eng	What is weighing you down?
12150092	eng	What would you never do?
12150096	eng	Mary is winding Tom up.
12150111	eng	I can well imagine that.
12150114	eng	A child needs a father.
12150130	eng	It is not so simple.
12150153	eng	I try to speak German.
12150154	eng	Could I borrow this CD?
12150188	eng	I heard both of you.
12150297	eng	Tom has made good choices.
12150339	eng	I had a blast tonight.
12150362	eng	Tom has a hardware store.
12150412	eng	Would you like some brandy?
12150641	eng	I searched that room myself.
12150660	eng	This picture is worth nothing.
12150665	eng	Lebanon is under Iranian occupation.
12150713	eng	I had a big meal.
12150846	eng	Tom stepped on a landmine.
12150879	eng	My father loved that song.
12150886	eng	How can we avoid that?
12150901	eng	I found that out yesterday.
12150908	eng	Keep Tom out of danger.
12150909	eng	Did you discuss anything else?
12150956	eng	I got my script refilled.
12150965	eng	I had a bad journey.
12151095	eng	Everybody dumped Tom except me.
12151099	eng	Tom really was a carpenter.
12151116	eng	Which direction did Tom take?
12151164	eng	Mary did that for herself.
12151190	eng	That rumor is very old.
12151261	eng	Nobody wants to be alone.
12151317	eng	Tom glued it back together.
12151321	eng	Nothing will stop us now.
12151340	eng	Which path did Tom take?
12151341	eng	Which bus did Tom take?
12151347	eng	Tom may have mentioned that.
12151349	eng	That must be Tom's car.
12151352	eng	Accidents happen on the job.
12151359	eng	Tell Tom that I'm waiting.
12151363	eng	No one knew I existed.
12151377	eng	Nothing costs more than free.
12151394	eng	It was just an assumption.
12151395	eng	Tom has everything we need.
12151515	eng	Tom wants to eat early.
12151535	eng	Tom is young and naïve.
12151537	eng	Tom got the money back.
12151539	eng	I had a big year.
12151542	eng	Mary and Tom are naïve.
12151567	eng	Talk to Tom about that.
12151620	eng	Tom has a medical background.
12151681	eng	I talked to Tom directly.
12151714	eng	I had a busy week.
12151778	eng	I guess Tom trusted you.
12151784	eng	I rather enjoyed the party.
12151799	eng	Do you remember your dreams?
12151809	eng	Tom is an escaped prisoner.
12151811	eng	Your soup is getting cold.
12151854	eng	Tom is out with Mary.
12151935	eng	Who's that behind the wheel?
12152051	eng	How will Tom find us?
12152055	eng	Are you all leaving now?
12152086	eng	Of course, I was scared.
12152111	eng	Mary can look after herself.
12152157	eng	I heard about your accident.
12152267	eng	That was just a question.
12152268	eng	That was only one question.
12152272	eng	Are you looking to sell?
12152302	eng	Put something under his head.
12152306	eng	Mary can tell me herself.
12152472	eng	Hiring Tom was a mistake.
12152479	eng	You're a very bad man.
12152521	eng	Tom sat on the sand.
12152528	eng	I owe you some money.
12152540	eng	Say that you were wrong.
12152543	eng	It seems you were wrong.
12152545	eng	Tom acknowledged he was wrong.
12152547	eng	Tell me you were wrong.
12152554	eng	You know you were wrong.
12152556	eng	You were wrong about everything.
12152559	eng	You were wrong about us.
12152590	eng	Tom gave me this candy.
12152634	eng	Did you see the photograph?
12152653	eng	Tom is Mary's legal guardian.
12152659	eng	I have a Geiger counter.
12152682	eng	How much do carrots cost?
12152693	eng	Our paths will cross someday.
12152761	eng	This is a thankless job.
12152778	eng	Ask Tom not to come.
12152783	eng	No one said a thing.
12152785	eng	That likely belongs to Tom.
12152805	eng	Tom is an uneducated fool.
12152831	eng	I found work for you.
12152905	eng	Put me through to Tom.
12152932	eng	When did you shower last?
12152933	eng	When did you last shower?
12152944	eng	Which one suits you better?
12152946	eng	Which time suits you better?
12152947	eng	What time suits you better?
12152949	eng	When did the fog lift?
12152980	eng	Tom looked in the room.
12153015	eng	Tom sat in the mud.
12153079	eng	I'm actually kind of sad.
12153137	eng	I was a forest ranger.
12153153	eng	I can talk to Tom.
12153212	eng	What are you planning now?
12153298	eng	Would you cover for Tom?
12153305	eng	Cross your fingers for me.
12153318	eng	Tom is on call tonight.
12153327	eng	Tom was a student leader.
12153403	eng	How did this all happen?
12153415	eng	Tom and Mary made up.
12153425	eng	Picking sides is always dangerous.
12153446	eng	Are you all done changing?
12153460	eng	It couldn't have been Tom.
12153473	eng	Tom and Mary are allies.
12153478	eng	They couldn't get to Tom.
12153532	eng	You should comply with Tom.
12153554	eng	Take me to the park.
12153563	eng	Why does Tom care anyway?
12153582	eng	Is Tom still your employee?
12153602	eng	This will be over tomorrow.
12153677	eng	Get out and stay out.
12153690	eng	War is bad for children.
12153699	eng	My care coordinator is Tom.
12153862	eng	The bartender cut Tom off.
12153867	eng	I want to help cook.
12153869	eng	They want to understand life.
12153878	eng	We want to understand life.
12153894	eng	He wants to understand life.
12154023	eng	I want to understand life.
12154025	eng	Tom and Mary swapped seats.
12154098	eng	Did you find Tom's medicine?
12154159	eng	I guess Tom told you.
12154202	eng	Are you all working hard?
12154227	eng	Do what the man says.
12154275	eng	We often go swimming together.
12154283	eng	Send my regards to him.
12154284	eng	Send my regards to them.
12154287	eng	I asked Tom flat out.
12154306	eng	I ask for your understanding.
12154323	eng	I have nothing against it.
12154328	eng	Your voice is too loud.
12154337	eng	Are Tom and Mary fine?
12154340	eng	I heard you saved Tom.
12154344	eng	I love kittens and puppies.
12154354	eng	You've got a green light.
12154356	eng	You've got a green arrow.
12154371	eng	That may already be happening.
12154377	eng	Tom's in the fox suit.
12154385	eng	Tom has hurt someone else.
12154386	eng	You aren't thirsty, are you?
12154391	eng	You may contact Tom directly.
12154403	eng	Tom joined the Hare Krishnas.
12154409	eng	I saw hundreds of birds.
12154432	eng	Actually, I'm younger than Tom.
12154456	eng	Tom is actually pretty smart.
12154475	eng	Get a pen and paper.
12154480	eng	Did you see the palace?
12154507	eng	You sound like a Canadian.
12154517	eng	There is only one exit.
12154544	eng	Has Tom shown up yet?
12154546	eng	Tom may be getting away.
12154554	eng	Did Tom know Mary's address?
12154555	eng	I miss working with you.
12154563	eng	I'm always under the cosh.
12154582	eng	Don't leave your baggage unattended.
12154628	eng	Come out to the balcony.
12154729	eng	I had the weirdest cravings.
12154730	eng	I knew Tom was going.
12154868	eng	Tom sat in his armchair.
12154953	eng	Can you please print these?
12154954	eng	Can you please print this?
12154972	eng	Tom is such a goody-goody.
12154980	eng	Tom will be right down.
12154983	eng	I want him to suffer.
12154994	eng	How many Canadians were there?
12155093	eng	Tom has become a Mormon.
12155111	eng	Tomorrow, I leave for Boston.
12155148	eng	I changed my hair color.
12155175	eng	I need a new body.
12155176	eng	I need a new brain.
12155179	eng	Would you like a tissue?
12155192	eng	When will we be there?
12155204	eng	Canadians do the same thing.
12155212	eng	Your wishes may come true.
12155214	eng	You might like Chuck's Diner.
12155225	eng	It's later than I thought.
12155232	eng	Steal from large corporate chains.
12155234	eng	You have to tell me.
12155278	eng	I've changed my hair color.
12155357	eng	This feels like a scam.
12155465	eng	This is probably from Tom.
12155473	eng	This is my humble house.
12155554	eng	I guess that means no.
12155629	eng	She did not find peace.
12155630	eng	He did not find peace.
12155634	eng	I had a bad morning.
12155637	eng	We did not find peace.
12155648	eng	You did not find peace.
12155735	eng	Three acres is not enough.
12155793	eng	Tom's foster parents adopted him.
12155813	eng	They feel sorry for us.
12155820	eng	I have a college fund.
12155898	eng	I don't criticise my brother.
12155918	eng	I slipped in the bathtub.
12155922	eng	Tom said nothing about it.
12155928	eng	Tom may be in there.
12155931	eng	You're worse than your brother.
12155932	eng	Tom was really quite convincing.
12155933	eng	I guess I'm pretty hungry.
12155937	eng	This makes me feel safe.
12155959	eng	People usually ask more questions.
12155970	eng	He did not look back.
12155972	eng	She did not look back.
12155974	eng	They did not look back.
12155993	eng	Tom is a horrible guy.
12156009	eng	I've learnt a new word.
12156035	eng	No one saw Tom leaving.
12156038	eng	Nobody had done that before.
12156063	eng	This is my boyfriend, Tom.
12156066	eng	I just really liked it.
12156087	eng	My roommate's name is Tom.
12156097	eng	I knew Tom was innocent.
12156100	eng	Of course, you should go.
12156149	eng	Why should you go anywhere?
12156161	eng	Accidents happen out of negligence.
12156167	eng	How was Tom threatening you?
12156176	eng	Tom might lose his job.
12156198	eng	Tom would like to speak.
12156231	eng	Tom hurt his leg recently.
12156265	eng	I really love Christmas Eve.
12156472	eng	Tom will keep his word.
12156489	eng	Tell us about the accident.
12156565	eng	Tell me about your operation.
12156625	eng	I think everyone misses Tom.
12156795	eng	Tom was responsible for this.
12157012	eng	I understand Tom was there.
12157092	eng	Why isn't Tom asleep yet?
12157101	eng	Why isn't Tom still sleeping?
12157229	eng	I knew every person there.
12157332	eng	Mary is actually pretty cute.
12157426	eng	How does Tom know Mary?
12157490	eng	Call Tom in the morning.
12157497	eng	I accidentally deleted some files.
12157520	eng	How do I find Tom?
12157524	eng	Have you fulfilled your obligations?
12157525	eng	Have you fulfilled your duty?
12157529	eng	Tom talks like a child.
12157683	eng	Tom hurt me a lot.
12157689	eng	You're not telling me everything.
12157690	eng	Where did Tom get to?
12157691	eng	Are you all happy now?
12157697	eng	Guess I’ll have another round.
12157706	eng	I talked to Tom afterward.
12157825	eng	I had a complicated week.
12157877	eng	Why would I feel guilty?
12157879	eng	I have that same problem.
12157906	eng	This is Tom and Mary.
12157925	eng	I guess I believe Tom.
12157926	eng	How about donating some blood?
12157968	eng	A candle lit the room.
12157997	eng	I should've brought a torch.
12158032	eng	What stopped you coming yesterday?
12158063	eng	No one is quite sure.
12158088	eng	The river burst its banks.
12158134	eng	We're at home on Sundays.
12158147	eng	Show Tom what to do.
12158153	eng	I've already heard about it.
12158157	eng	My parents are probably worrying.
12158159	eng	I haven't even seen it.
12158174	eng	His sweet nature disgusted me.
12158175	eng	That may actually be Tom.
12158191	eng	Tom is strongly against it.
12158194	eng	Tom may know what happened.
12158202	eng	We should've never gotten married.
12158239	eng	I pretended I was dead.
12158373	eng	Show the pictures to Tom.
12158466	eng	Where is Tom holed up?
12158574	eng	What happened to you, Tom?
12158582	eng	Nobody ever asks me anything.
12158598	eng	Should I call you Tom?
12158670	eng	Take care of this immediately.
12158714	eng	You can do it high.
12158741	eng	Tom is bullying Mary again.
12158744	eng	We climbed Mt. Fuji together.
12158759	eng	I'm tired of lazy bothsidesism.
12158772	eng	Tom will most certainly come.
12158794	eng	Tom was a great cop.
12158845	eng	Tom and Mary like S&M.
12158847	eng	Tom and Mary like sado-maso.
12158865	eng	I accomplished what I wanted.
12158867	eng	I heard Tom mention this.
12158870	eng	Where is that ferry going?
12158919	eng	Tom is here on business.
12158997	eng	When did Tom contact you?
12159016	eng	Our deadline is quickly approaching.
12159017	eng	Tom has three teenage daughters.
12159019	eng	Did you ask Tom that?
12159020	eng	I found out what happened.
12159023	eng	I saw who was driving.
12159029	eng	Did you meet with Tom?
12159030	eng	I can't go on alone.
12159052	eng	Did you see Tom's pictures?
12159053	eng	Have you found a babysitter?
12159054	eng	Have you found a sitter?
12159056	eng	I want a younger brother.
12159080	eng	Tom was released on bail.
12159083	eng	Should we walk to town?
12159149	eng	Tom put me in charge.
12159208	eng	Have you fallen in love?
12159228	eng	Tell me about the ambush.
12159234	eng	Thanks for getting it back.
12159261	eng	Have you done something illegal?
12159262	eng	Tom went missing last October.
12159263	eng	Our deal has been canceled.
12159266	eng	I think Tom would've approved.
12159285	eng	I can take Tom shopping.
12159298	eng	Tom was just like me.
12159303	eng	Does Tom ever visit you?
12159315	eng	Tom always was a weirdo.
12159318	eng	One of you stay here.
12159322	eng	Maybe Tom put it there.
12159325	eng	Nobody can ever change that.
12159350	eng	This is a beautiful song.
12159367	eng	Tom was suspended last week.
12159371	eng	Tom made the ultimate sacrifice.
12159373	eng	I have nothing against that.
12159396	eng	He asked me intrusive questions.
12159444	eng	Tom has left the island.
12159447	eng	Tom sings with a band.
12159468	eng	Do you know any poems?
12159475	eng	I hear you found Tom.
12159538	eng	Have you both been drinking?
12159540	eng	Did you also see Tom?
12159541	eng	Our new deadline is tomorrow.
12159552	eng	I had a Canadian coach.
12159652	eng	Have you been dating anybody?
12159653	eng	Have you been dating anyone?
12159658	eng	Did you see Tom laughing?
12159663	eng	Did you hear Tom laughing?
12159664	eng	Have you been eating properly?
12159665	eng	Have you been eating well?
12159668	eng	Are you already worn out?
12159671	eng	That man looks like Tom.
12159711	eng	I spoke to a lawyer.
12159719	eng	Has Tom hurt someone again?
12159765	eng	Let's cross the bridge together.
12159779	eng	Tom was granted an exemption.
12159780	eng	Tom was given an exemption.
12159822	eng	Tom and Mary were whispering.
12159830	eng	We're playing by the rules.
12159836	eng	Tom is my oldest friend.
12159924	eng	You owe me some money.
12159927	eng	You go complain to Tom.
12159984	eng	You have my full trust.
12159997	eng	They gave me a present.
12159998	eng	They didn't get my joke!
12159999	eng	This is a big challenge.
12160001	eng	Rumors are you're coming back.
12160005	eng	I've always been saying this.
12160012	eng	Did you validate your card?
12160109	eng	I kind of suspected it.
12160117	eng	Tell Tom to wait there.
12160122	eng	Accidents can happen to anyone.
12160370	eng	Your actions betrayed my trust.
12160383	eng	Did you see Tom's show?
12160389	eng	You've missed your big chance.
12160448	eng	Has someone been mistreating you?
12160499	eng	Tom has pulled some strings.
12160500	eng	You should leave Boston immediately.
12160511	eng	What are you losers doing?
12160517	eng	You should ask for help.
12160547	eng	I heard back from Tom.
12160549	eng	I heard about the accusations.
12160596	eng	Tom, did I upset you?
12160604	eng	I knew Tom was safe.
12160646	eng	How much did Tom see?
12160647	eng	I feel more humble now.
12160653	eng	Tom is much stronger now.
12160662	eng	May I borrow your trumpet?
12160673	eng	Which sentence did she choose?
12160680	eng	Unfortunately, he refused to come.
12160689	eng	Tom should've stayed with Mary.
12160749	eng	I was introduced to Tom.
12160775	eng	Tom, you are the coolest.
12160776	eng	I play the banjo, too.
12160785	eng	The results are still unconfirmed.
12160792	eng	Take care of these gentlemen.
12160804	eng	There was a slap-up meal.
12160809	eng	I just bought this thermometer.
12160813	eng	Thanks for what you're doing.
12160818	eng	The hotel is fully booked.
12160820	eng	That must be Tom's flatmate.
12160821	eng	That must be Tom's housemate.
12160825	eng	Tom is having a kip.
12160826	eng	Tom is having forty winks.
12160835	eng	When did Dad get home?
12160845	eng	The website is updated automatically.
12160846	eng	Meg's hair is naturally curly.
12160848	eng	Cheese is not easily digestible.
12160855	eng	Things seem a little rocky.
12160902	eng	Tom never does anything interesting.
12160908	eng	What are you really reading?
12160914	eng	What are you three doing?
12160951	eng	I myself always drink brandy.
12161188	eng	This will be over soon.
12161346	eng	I guess it makes sense.
12161434	eng	We tried to recruit Tom.
12161510	eng	I knew Tom was alone.
12161687	eng	Which tie should I wear?
12161700	eng	Which bus goes to Boston?
12161706	eng	Which puppy do you want?
12161743	eng	Which leg did Tom break?
12161755	eng	Which did you like best?
12161756	eng	Which did you like better?
12161757	eng	Which did you like most?
12161758	eng	Which did you like more?
12161776	eng	Which knife did you use?
12161777	eng	Which knife should I use?
12161829	eng	Tom killed himself last week.
12161888	eng	Hide before Tom sees you.
12161900	eng	This is a Canadian dish.
12161981	eng	Was Tom here on Monday?
12162035	eng	I talked to Tom earlier.
12162041	eng	Tom was a deacon here.
12162081	eng	You should congratulate your daughter.
12162206	eng	Tom found me this job.
12162215	eng	Tell me about the accident.
12162223	eng	I heard about that boat.
12162244	eng	Make sure nothing is omitted.
12162259	eng	You're going to get wet.
12162273	eng	This is a new problem.
12162277	eng	Tom just went in there.
12162279	eng	I just sprained my ankle.
12162281	eng	I just ran into Tom.
12162306	eng	Did you find a weapon?
12162317	eng	She tried to bite me.
12162337	eng	What happened to your hands?
12162338	eng	Tom may have already eaten.
12162358	eng	I have a broken collarbone.
12162364	eng	Let me be your guide.
12162401	eng	I love Tom and Mary.
12162407	eng	Tom ate at Chuck's Diner.
12162434	eng	We're closing up early today.
12162435	eng	Tom is so much fun.
12162453	eng	I am thinking for myself.
12162520	eng	Tom and Mary are foreigners.
12162523	eng	You sounded pretty mad yesterday.
12162571	eng	Welcome to the easy life.
12162593	eng	Tom hurt Mary really bad.
12162597	eng	We need another clarinet player.
12162632	eng	Are you going after Tom?
12162637	eng	Tom was a restaurant musician.
12162646	eng	What are you growing now?
12162724	eng	I have a baby sister.
12162812	eng	Let me call Tom first.
12162826	eng	Tom hasn't actually done anything.
12162894	eng	Do you remember this one?
12162899	eng	Tom may not be alone.
12163146	eng	Could you watch the place?
12163193	eng	What exactly did Tom eat?
12163211	eng	Obviously, this isn't a coincidence.
12163267	eng	I knew Tom was responsible.
12163283	eng	Tom was by my side.
12163292	eng	That must've been a trick.
12163339	eng	I wish to see Tom.
12163414	eng	Even a child would've understood.
12163525	eng	I think it was Tom.
12163545	eng	Tom is obviously very sick.
12163579	eng	Did you see Tom dancing?
12163586	eng	Your name is so beautiful.
12163595	eng	Tom, come here a second.
12163596	eng	We vacationed together last summer.
12163609	eng	Tom decided nothing was wrong.
12163656	eng	Tom got to meet Mary.
12163657	eng	Is everything O.K. in there?
12163698	eng	I love cherry blossom season.
12163717	eng	Everyone knows what to expect.
12163723	eng	Does Tom hurt you often?
12163728	eng	We'll meet at 3.00 pm.
12163729	eng	We'll meet at 3 pm.
12163744	eng	Tom is a rational man.
12163758	eng	We may also need that.
12163768	eng	Tom isn't ill any more.
12163769	eng	Tom's not ill any more.
12163770	eng	Tom looked a bit ill.
12163772	eng	Tom has analysed the results.
12163802	eng	I spoke to Tom's doctor.
12163849	eng	That guy looks like Tom.
12163866	eng	I lied about seeing Tom.
12163868	eng	You should go see Tom.
12163869	eng	What are you suggesting exactly?
12163899	eng	I wish Tom liked me.
12163903	eng	Everyone wants to interview Tom.
12163910	eng	Have you read the ad?
12163941	eng	Tom is a bit predictable.
12163942	eng	Click on that red button.
12163944	eng	We're almost ready to depart.
12164007	eng	Are you talking about hats?
12164014	eng	I could hear Tom shouting.
12164017	eng	We're almost ready to go.
12164083	eng	Misunderstandings like this are common.
12164100	eng	Is Tom OK or not?
12164153	eng	Does Tom take any medications?
12164190	eng	Tom's car blew a gasket.
12164224	eng	It's necessary to help Tom.
12164303	eng	This may also be evidence.
12164313	eng	Does Tom work for you?
12164319	eng	This is an old recipe.
12164345	eng	Your sons are very rich.
12164356	eng	Did Tom ever date Mary?
12164357	eng	Has Tom ever dated Mary?
12164556	eng	They say Tom is crazy.
12164566	eng	Tom was laughing at you.
12164577	eng	Tom will keep Mary safe.
12164608	eng	I came back to life.
12164609	eng	There's no escape from this.
12164653	eng	I heard a pot fall.
12164658	eng	Tom may also be there.
12164718	eng	Welcome to my modest home.
12164739	eng	Do you want to participate?
12164807	eng	That may belong to Tom.
12164812	eng	Tom is a Canadian guy.
12164824	eng	Tom must be in there.
12164828	eng	This is a bit salty.
12164846	eng	That house is really small.
12164868	eng	Tom was actually very sick.
12164873	eng	I had a date today.
12164881	eng	Tom usually wears black clothes.
12164891	eng	Was Tom at your wedding?
12164895	eng	Tom said you threatened Mary.
12164898	eng	I thought that was funny.
12164904	eng	Tom takes care of us.
12164909	eng	Tom disappeared in the forest.
12164918	eng	Tom knew about the list.
12164932	eng	Are Tom and John roommates?
12164937	eng	Is Tom usually on time?
12164943	eng	I had the weirdest day.
12164952	eng	Actually, it was my mistake.
12164988	eng	I found something really odd.
12165004	eng	What's more important than that?
12165007	eng	What a bunch of jerks!
12165036	eng	Tom packed a box lunch.
12165039	eng	I found the film entertaining.
12165046	eng	Did you see that movie?
12165053	eng	Have you been having nightmares?
12165063	eng	Have you found an apartment?
12165083	eng	Have you found a flat?

12165091	eng	Everything seems possible at night.
12165099	eng	Have you ever loved anybody?
12165100	eng	He recognised her and blushed.
12165102	eng	That's too a high price.
12165103	eng	It's too a high price.
12165105	eng	The light hurts our eyes.
12165112	eng	This class has forty pupils.
12165139	eng	Did you see the fountain?
12165157	eng	Did you bring warm clothes?
12165214	eng	There is no way out.
12165252	eng	I found out by accident.
12165306	eng	Have you done much painting?
12165311	eng	Hopefully, Tom can help us.
12165357	eng	Now tell me about it.
12165390	eng	I saw your performance yesterday.
12165420	eng	Have you given up already?
12165428	eng	Do you have a hairdryer?
12165493	eng	I wish Tom were alive.

12165748	eng	I escaped from my husband.
12165750	eng	Tom can go to Boston.
12165758	eng	I found something to do.
12165831	eng	Have you been fired again?
12165881	eng	I saw a terrible accident.
12165946	eng	Have you watered the plants?
12165992	eng	Tom became a bit annoyed.
12165999	eng	Have you signed the papers?
12166099	eng	She lives in Tokyo now.
12166122	eng	Actually, Tom was very kind.
12166126	eng	Do you have my coat?
12166179	eng	Have you locked yourself out?
12166186	eng	You missed a spot there.
12166199	eng	Are your parents up yet?
12166202	eng	Nobody knew I was there.
12166205	eng	I think Tom was involved.
12166247	eng	Have you read this story?
12166252	eng	Order me a club sandwich.
12166274	eng	Tom hurt himself very badly.
12166322	eng	Did you buy a puppy?
12166346	eng	I've spoken to Tom already.
12166349	eng	You're not on the list.
12166373	eng	Tom is a bit old.
12166375	eng	I had a blast there.
12166380	eng	Have you cleaned the chimney?
12166413	eng	Did you really stab Tom?
12166421	eng	No one's waiting for me.

12166460	eng	Someone slept on the sofa.
12166494	eng	The weather today is minging.
12166565	eng	Strawberries are expensive in winter.
12166566	eng	Strawberries are dear in winter.
12166579	eng	Let me be equally frank.
12166612	eng	Have you considered it carefully?
12166648	eng	Tom wants more than Mary.
12166651	eng	Have you told anybody this?
12166654	eng	It makes sense to carpool.
12166656	eng	Have you checked the equipment?
12166661	eng	That often happens to me.
12166664	eng	This often happens to me.
12166695	eng	Did you consult a doctor?
12166794	eng	Tom omitted some key facts.
12166797	eng	I met Tom this weekend.
12166808	eng	Have you ever eaten grits?
12166812	eng	Did Tom ever kiss Mary?
12166910	eng	I have a thankless job.

12166998	eng	I just bought a bicycle.
12167068	eng	I talked to Tom today.
12167091	eng	I found us some food.
12167106	eng	Let me see that paper.

12167198	eng	Have you called your folks?
12167237	eng	Did you answer Tom's questions?
12167244	eng	Let me add some oil.
12167317	eng	Our brother is a pianist.
12167323	eng	When will this injustice end?
12167324	eng	He thinks that aliens exist.
12167342	eng	Did you see Tom's room?
12167350	eng	I eat when I'm nervous.
12167352	eng	I was trusting my friend.
12167441	eng	I had the strangest hallucinations.
12167443	eng	Did they take Tom away?
12167502	eng	Which ones did you buy?
12167533	eng	Let me be completely frank.
12167535	eng	Do you have the sprockets?

12167626	eng	Did you see the minister?

12167714	eng	Have you been horseback riding?
12167740	eng	Cross the first letter out.
12167752	eng	Cross out the first letter.
12167759	eng	Guess what I brought today.
12167762	eng	Tom had errands to run.
12167765	eng	Have you ever been hunting?
12167775	eng	What are you specializing in?
12167782	eng	Have you seen anything weird?
12167799	eng	Have you seen a therapist?
12167838	eng	Tom needs that back now.
12167866	eng	I know Mary killed herself.
12167943	eng	I saw something very curious.
12167971	eng	I heard about all that.

12167977	eng	I found something of yours.
12168059	eng	Have you called for help?
12168060	eng	I saw Tom eating lunch.

12168179	eng	What if Tom dumps me?
12168208	eng	One can always learn more.
12168217	eng	Have you done anything wrong?
12168264	eng	Tom may not have proof.
12168345	eng	I heard about all it.
12168355	eng	Have you considered my proposal?
12168357	eng	What should I have said?
12168358	eng	Did you talk about Tom?
12168369	eng	Perhaps I should call Tom.
12168371	eng	Perhaps I should phone Tom.
12168440	eng	You only made it worse.
12168456	eng	Do you have anything stronger?
12168482	eng	I knew every girl there.
12168584	eng	Have you seen anything suspicious?
12168585	eng	I don't contradict my boss.
12168625	eng	Tom will be in soon.
12168649	eng	You need to trust yourself.
12168661	eng	They were very difficult days.
12168667	eng	I cannot walk any further.
12168691	eng	Do you have dinner ready?
12168700	eng	This cannot help Peter anymore.
12168702	eng	You jumped out without permission.
12168703	eng	Some viruses are wonderful magnified.
12168704	eng	Did you buy anything else?
12168741	eng	I saw your audition video.
12168743	eng	You need to stay still.
12168757	eng	Let me announce the results.
12168769	eng	Let me just be frank.
12168798	eng	Everyone said Tom was crazy.
12168802	eng	We ran along the river.

12168940	eng	Have you ever been mistreated?
12168945	eng	Will Tom go by himself?
12168947	eng	I heard about your condition.
12168953	eng	Tom is a fascinating character.
12168962	eng	How was it in Boston?
12168969	eng	We've made those changes already.
12168979	eng	We got a surprising result.
12169011	eng	Do you have any ketchup?
12169023	eng	Have you had enough yet?
12169042	eng	I would never abandon Tom.
12169047	eng	This train doesn't stop here.
12169072	eng	Is Tom still a bachelor?
12169077	eng	Nobody can get in there.
12169085	eng	I burned the old books.
12169095	eng	What colour is the paintwork?
12169132	eng	I cancelled my hotel booking.
12169167	eng	Overgenerosity is his greatest flaw.
12169171	eng	Peacocks have colourful tail feathers.
12169184	eng	Can't you shut your mouth?
12169230	eng	We all went quickly aboard.
12169254	eng	Did you break your arm?
12169256	eng	I guess Tom was drunk.
12169276	eng	All her flatmates are nice.
12169289	eng	I've got used to you.
12169379	eng	Have you written the speech?
12169392	eng	Let Tom and me go.
12169443	eng	Is your stomach still upset?
12169458	eng	Welcome to being a grown-up.
12169469	eng	What a dork I was!
12169499	eng	I have nothing against men.
12169524	eng	I had three voice messages.
12169527	eng	Old people are like that.
12169549	eng	Some stores are offering discounts.
12169573	eng	Who knows, maybe it's love?
12169577	eng	That is beyond my control.
12169601	eng	He will wash the windows.
12169604	eng	Ethiopia is a poor country.

12169673	eng	I saw someone following me.
12169674	eng	It depends on you guys.
12169675	eng	That's too philosophical for me.
12169688	eng	Have you been gambling again?
12169693	eng	Remember that you are human.
12169758	eng	Go back to your room!
12169764	eng	Don't make fun of people!
12169776	eng	That was just an estimate.
12169791	eng	I don't have any books.
12169805	eng	He is calming you down.
12169806	eng	It doesn't sound that bad.

12169826	eng	He was assassinated in 1997.
12169827	eng	He was murdered in 1997.
12169830	eng	I can't rely on her.
12169831	eng	He can't answer this question.
12169880	eng	I got a goodnight kiss.
12169883	eng	I'm getting an error message.
12169896	eng	I found one I like.
12169898	eng	I knew Tom had one.

12170440	eng	Tom finally gave his consent.
12170443	eng	Did you buy all that?
12170453	eng	Nobody calls me Tom anymore.
12170462	eng	I found something very odd.
12170476	eng	I'd be interested in that.
12170478	eng	He sold all his possessions.
12170512	eng	Can you even understand it?
12170547	eng	Woohoo! Do you hear me?
12170552	eng	Are you alone again today?

12177649	eng	Have you been eating fish?
12177656	eng	Am I causing a problem?
12177894	eng	Hide here and stay quiet.

12181005	eng	Did you catch the kidnapper?
12181008	eng	Have you done anything exciting?
12181015	eng	Have you decided to wait?
12181036	eng	Tom may have been lost.
12181038	eng	Have you been outside recently?

12181388	eng	I paid for those shoes.
12181392	eng	Who feels the other feeling?
12181417	eng	Did you see Tom drinking?
12181773	eng	Have you told us everything?
12181871	eng	They went round their grandmother's.

12182306	eng	What are you into now?
12182353	eng	Tom, your taxi is here.
12182378	eng	What a dummy you are!
12182384	eng	Let's walk through the park.
12182385	eng	Tom always picked on me.
12182386	eng	Nobody ever found gold there.
12182393	eng	Did you boil the water?
12182406	eng	Do you have bleeding gums?
12182411	eng	You accused Tom of theft.
12182442	eng	We're not even having coffee?
12182453	eng	Did he do something right?
12182483	eng	You're such a silly sausage.

12182576	eng	Hopefully, it'll be over soon.
12182638	eng	Did you really tell Tom?
12182767	eng	Have you been modelling long?

12184282	eng	He was honest at least.
12184358	eng	The door is frozen shut.

12184396	eng	Does Tom own a rifle?
12184397	eng	Provide evidence or shut up.
12184399	eng	Provide evidence, or shut up.
12184402	eng	Act like a grown woman.
12184441	eng	Our sons played baseball together.
12184454	eng	Do you have anything bigger?
12184459	eng	You're not getting enough sleep.
12184470	eng	You aren't getting enough sleep.
12184484	eng	Have you found any money?
12184489	eng	I guess that was wrong.
12184493	eng	Did you meet Tom yesterday?
12184497	eng	I saw who did it.

12184668	eng	Have you found any clues?
12184678	eng	Have you ever tried sushi?
12184682	eng	Have you done something stupid?
12184685	eng	I feel uncomfortable around Tom.

12185171	eng	I'll begin reading starting today.
12185174	eng	How can you compare them?!
12185184	eng	We must not act unconstitutionally.

12185942	eng	I should've worn my sunglasses.
12185952	eng	Tom may have betrayed us.
12185966	eng	Tomorrow I'll bring three boxes.
12185972	eng	Where did you have supper?

12186806	eng	Can you quit your job?
12186819	eng	Have you been there recently?
12186851	eng	Have you read these reports?
12186852	eng	Tom was starting to panic.
12186900	eng	This is an astonishing discovery.

12187772	eng	What is that pungent odor?
12187796	eng	I've got to be frank.
12187803	eng	Have you ever been sailing?
12187810	eng	All the children are playing.

12188025	eng	I went back to Boston.
12188055	eng	Have you been treated well?
12188075	eng	Give me what is mine.
12188282	eng	I don't care about honors.

12188342	eng	The car went forward slowly.
12188361	eng	How soon will we arrive?
12188378	eng	We saw him just now.

12188670	eng	Tom's request was perfectly reasonable.
12188731	eng	Tom was obsessed with you.
12188739	eng	Did you buy a motorcycle?
12188815	eng	Who said that and when?
12188996	eng	You should've worn a belt.
12188999	eng	Tom fell down the cliff.

12189122	eng	I have a Canadian boyfriend.
12189126	eng	There's nothing wrong with ambition.
12189167	eng	Now you've made Tom leave.

12189471	eng	Are you all threatening me?
12189494	eng	I'm making a chocolate babka.
12189497	eng	Perhaps we misunderstand each other.
12189509	eng	The new one is funny.
12189512	eng	Tom couldn't explain it clearly.
12189519	eng	I'm not really doing that.
12189560	eng	Something horrible happened to Tom.
12189613	eng	Hate speech inspires mass shootings.
12189665	eng	I had a peculiar feeling.
12189674	eng	I work at a supermarket.
12189734	eng	I found a secret passage.
12189758	eng	Did Tom ever take part?
12189760	eng	Have you suffered a lot?
12189824	eng	I'll turn on the light.
12189832	eng	Did you hear the explosion?
12189857	eng	Is Tom not back yet?
12189858	eng	Did you approve those changes?
12189870	eng	Did you cook everything yourself?

12189888	eng	Did you call the bank?
12189889	eng	Do you have a contract?
12189891	eng	Did you close your eyes?
12189893	eng	Tom blamed Mary for everything.
12189895	eng	Do you have any scars?
12189897	eng	What happened to your umbrella?
12189901	eng	How about a baloney sandwich?
12189903	eng	Where are the carrot sticks?
12189904	eng	Did Tom do that, too?
12189905	eng	Did Tom also do that?
12189908	eng	Did you bring a jacket?
12189927	eng	They welched on the deal.

12190178	eng	I thought I heard Tom.
12190179	eng	Did you bring enough food?
12190237	eng	I'll turn the lights on.
12190243	eng	They're playing in the courtyard.
12190255	eng	The resuscitation attempts were successful.
12190278	eng	She'll be a good doctor.
12190583	eng	Nobody else here speaks French.
12190587	eng	I'd just like some coffee.
12190591	eng	Did you call a taxi?
12190592	eng	I had an accident, too.
12190605	eng	Are you Tom's older son?
12190790	eng	That was a tough situation.
12190798	eng	Someone thought Tom could help.
12190799	eng	Have you had plastic surgery?
12190801	eng	The police have shown up.
12190811	eng	Look what Tom bought me.
12190867	eng	I talked to your superiors.
12191130	eng	Tom used to harass me.
12191134	eng	Let me borrow this knife.

12191421	eng	The room's window is round.
12191429	eng	Did you both get promoted?
12191435	eng	You haven't seen the doctor.
12191441	eng	Now tell me the truth.
12191442	eng	How much are the vegetables?
12191457	eng	I saw Tom driving away.
12191470	eng	The cash register is closed.
12191489	eng	There's no explanation for this.
12191528	eng	Tom liked you a lot.
12191532	eng	Many flowers are blooming now.
12191558	eng	I was happy till now.
12191619	eng	Tom kept everything to himself.
12191773	eng	Have you worked here long?
12191774	eng	Did you build this yourself?
12191798	eng	Here come Tom and Mary.
12192081	eng	Did you bring a sweater?
12192092	eng	Which ones did you choose?
12192094	eng	Does Tom ever compliment you?
12192237	eng	I'm going to the museum.
12192283	eng	Tom is a strict theorist.
12192324	eng	Theories also include abstract ideas.
12192356	eng	I called his house yesterday.
12192381	eng	Did you expect such success?
12192415	eng	I'm sorry I was impatient.
12192454	eng	Tom's problems aren't my concern.
12192497	eng	Tom plays hooky a lot.
12192525	eng	Tom couldn't stand the idea.
12192528	eng	Tom couldn't bear the thought.
12192531	eng	Tom has a hand grenade.
12192598	eng	You shouldn't break your word.
12192776	eng	Do you get my drift?
12192829	eng	That's your impression of me?
12193068	eng	Would you like a chocolate?
12193133	eng	No, she doesn't need that.
12193134	eng	Earthworms are especially useful animals.
12193135	eng	What's the use of wasps?
12193276	eng	People have always been people.
12193324	eng	Does this match the English?
12193401	eng	Oatmeal is good for you.
12193413	eng	I reached the level 18.
12193656	eng	Time went by so fast.
12193666	eng	Please hear Tom's story out!
12193778	eng	Tom is very generous indeed.
12193779	eng	Nobody gave me any money.
12193784	eng	Have you notified the police?
12193836	eng	We had a big argument.
12194015	eng	When can we visit her?

12198237	eng	It's too hot to work.
12198263	eng	Tom welched on his debt.
12198264	eng	What are you grumbling about?

12199610	eng	Time flew by so quickly.
12199697	eng	Have you considered your finances?
12199701	eng	Tom will take your offer.
12199907	eng	This is an audacious plan.

12214962	eng	Act as if you're working.
12214973	eng	Which ones are your daughters?
12215008	eng	It’s just a shot away.
12215037	eng	Have you heard any rumors?
12215040	eng	We watched a puppet show.
12215042	eng	I guess Tom is OK.
12215075	eng	Why don't they say it?
12215077	eng	Did you call the exterminator?
12215078	eng	I saw exactly what happened.
12215080	eng	May I ride your horse?
12215121	eng	I can solve your problem.
12215123	eng	Does your shoulder still hurt?
12215132	eng	I bought myself a piano.
12215133	eng	Tom and Mary are witnesses.
12215136	eng	Did Tom really run away?
12215144	eng	I have nothing against Boston.
12215158	eng	Did you enjoy your coffee?
12215177	eng	Which ones are your children?
12215270	eng	You helped me in Boston.
12215275	eng	Are your daughters with you?
12215342	eng	Nobody will bother us tonight.
12215381	eng	I thought everything was easy.
12215392	eng	Let me explain the problem.
12215531	eng	Tom was involved as well.
12215535	eng	Have you examined the evidence?
12215543	eng	Was Tom nice to you?
12215548	eng	Did you arrange an appointment?
12215606	eng	All we do is work.
12215610	eng	All she does is work.
12215612	eng	All he does is work.
12215614	eng	All they do is work.
12215721	eng	Would you wear a Stetson?
12215726	eng	Actually, Tom told me everything.
12215788	eng	All Tom does is work.
12215794	eng	Finally I can get off!
12215795	eng	Finally I can drop out!
12215816	eng	Tom will come for me.
12215822	eng	I didn't understand what happened.
12215840	eng	Are you kidding or what?
12216051	eng	Have you considered coming back?
12216216	eng	I drink milk. Do you?
12216241	eng	Do you have the medicine?
12216246	eng	I found out by chance.
12216257	eng	Can you take a hit?
12216273	eng	Anyone have a rag here?
12216289	eng	I rather like that name.
12216481	eng	Tom helped Mary get home.
12216484	eng	Did you draw this map?
12216488	eng	Did you hear Tom leave?
12216489	eng	What's the lead singer's name?
12216646	eng	Tom is a free man.
12216648	eng	Have you been home recently?
12216650	eng	Why did you recommend Tom?
12216697	eng	If you're afraid, stay outside.
12216749	eng	How do you evaluate candidates?
12216775	eng	Tom was wearing a beret.
12216782	eng	I rushed and lost money.
12216789	eng	Did you bring your boyfriend?
12216859	eng	Tom thought everything was easy.
12216911	eng	She punishes me every day.
12216933	eng	That's why I was hiding.
12216935	eng	That's why I've been hiding.
12216981	eng	I have already heard that.
12216996	eng	We saw him passing by.
12216997	eng	We saw him pass by.
12217016	eng	The earthquake happened at midnight.
12217071	eng	I agree with Tom absolutely.
12217103	eng	The Kia belongs to Dad.
12217184	eng	Tom took all our bonuses.
12217222	eng	Have you found a boyfriend?
12217232	eng	Did you drive here today?
12217244	eng	The prices are in euros.
12217248	eng	Mary isn't a hardcore gamer.
12217258	eng	Does he have any lotion?
12217280	eng	He does not like her.
12217282	eng	I did not like him.
12217285	eng	I did not like them.
12217303	eng	Have you finished your errands?
12217310	eng	She does not know anything.
12217332	eng	Do you have any samples?
12217344	eng	Have you reached a conclusion?
12217357	eng	Do you remember punching Tom?
12217358	eng	Did you catch some fish?
12217362	eng	Where did you steal this?
12217395	eng	Have you ever modeled before?
12217398	eng	I ate all the peanuts.
12217404	eng	This is a complicated matter.
12217463	eng	Tom couldn't stand the noise.
12217488	eng	Have you made a donation?
12217500	eng	This is a complicated deal.
12217583	eng	Mary's flat is tastefully decorated.
12217615	eng	His native country is Georgia.
12217648	eng	She likes taking centre stage.
12217660	eng	Is that knowledge or conjecture?
12217699	eng	Mary's painting the fence tomorrow.
12217720	eng	We did that on purpose.
12217721	eng	We did it on purpose.
12217741	eng	Mary doesn't remember saying that.
12217764	eng	I can't recharge my mobile.
12217786	eng	How are we, young man?
12217803	eng	You learnt nothing at school.
12217804	eng	You learned nothing at school.
12217810	eng	That's too many to count.
12217812	eng	She takes her room key.
12217838	eng	Have you already seen Tom?
12217844	eng	Do you have any soap?
12217847	eng	I wish to be frank.
12217854	eng	I feel a bit uneasy.
12217862	eng	Have you found another path?
12217864	eng	Have you found another way?
12217926	eng	I've never been outside Europe.
12217930	eng	Have you ever travelled abroad?
12217950	eng	How was it a problem?
12217953	eng	Nobody ever talked about that.
12217965	eng	You mustn't beat that dog.
12218060	eng	I want to eat too!
12218076	eng	Tom has brought Mary here.
12218079	eng	Did you catch the culprit?
12218226	eng	Could you wash your hands?
12218343	eng	He must make an appointment.
12218463	eng	Everyone thought she was dead.
12218476	eng	A car is following us.
12218494	eng	That's all that was said.
12218498	eng	I'm not dead; I'm sleeping.
12218507	eng	I already have the storyline.
12218512	eng	My daughter has started crawling.
12218618	eng	I was cheating on her.
12218649	eng	Did you enjoy the program?
12218653	eng	I helped somebody move today.
12218741	eng	Tom is an amiable chap.
12218742	eng	Are you already set up?
12218745	eng	Have you been eating onions?
12218791	eng	Tom is fanning the flames.
12218792	eng	Did you solve your problem?
12218861	eng	Tom feels better this morning.
12219031	eng	We all lie to ourselves.
12219034	eng	Just mimic what he does.
12219040	eng	He is dancing to communicate.
12219056	eng	The girl started to cry.
12219064	eng	He was injured in combat.
12219082	eng	I've already talked to everyone.
12219083	eng	Tom may have no money.
12219084	eng	Which way is the exit?
12219108	eng	Which one tickles your fancy?
12219120	eng	Have you finished your drink?
12219144	eng	Does your arm still hurt?
12219156	eng	Tom hurt someone I love.
12219158	eng	That may affect your future.
12219172	eng	Tom and Mary often quarrel.
12219175	eng	I locked all the doors.
12219178	eng	Today, I went shopping twice.
12219196	eng	I saw you hide something.
12219197	eng	Tom is a good ventriloquist.
12219199	eng	Do you want hot sauce?
12219208	eng	I gave Tom the money.
12219212	eng	Have you contacted the police?
12219215	eng	That hurts, so stop it.
12219274	eng	Tom may be down there.
12219364	eng	Dahlias always cheer me up.
12219365	eng	Did you know Tom flunked?
12219541	eng	Tom now has a girlfriend.
12219550	eng	Tom's safety is a concern.
12219551	eng	Strawberries are out of season.
12219553	eng	I'm concerned about Tom's safety.
12219681	eng	Have you ever actually voted?
12219691	eng	Tom was shouting in French.
12219695	eng	Do you remember those guys?
12219805	eng	Tell me about Tom's party.
12219806	eng	How serious were the problems?
12219811	eng	Tom is a fine fellow.
12219841	eng	I currently live in Switzerland.
12219842	eng	I'm currently living in Switzerland.
12219857	eng	Did you dare steal it?
12219859	eng	Did you really hit him?
12219881	eng	Stop arguing with your brother!
12219882	eng	Stop arguing with your sister!
12219900	eng	Have you joined a gym?
12219902	eng	We could bob for apples.
12219905	eng	How did they know Tom?
12219911	eng	Do you have the document?
12219980	eng	Guess what I wished for.
12219983	eng	Have you lost interest already?
12220051	eng	Tom is a sweet child.
12220154	eng	I found a few typos.
12220302	eng	I helped Tom last time.
12220308	eng	Do you have anything planned?
12220475	eng	Tom may have been scared.
12220918	eng	Have you seen Tom fall?
12221000	eng	"Is that a question?" "Yes."
12221012	eng	Be interested in your work.
12221029	eng	Did you really hit Tom?
12221046	eng	I thought Tom had problems.
12221058	eng	They demolished the old house.
12221061	eng	Have you forgotten your manners?
12221065	eng	Did you encounter any complications?
12221078	eng	She can say her word.
12221082	eng	You cannot say a word.
12221111	eng	Are you having money problems?
12221114	eng	I helped in the kitchen.
12221133	eng	Which rule did Tom break?
12221136	eng	Did you see the poster?
12221143	eng	I had a good dream.
12221160	eng	Tom clicked the "submit" button.
12221161	eng	Which way is the ballroom?
12221163	eng	How many customers are there?
12221170	eng	That mirror belongs to Tom.
12221171	eng	Have you finished your exams?
12221176	eng	I have to travel abroad.
12221177	eng	What does this tell us?
12221180	eng	You don't run fast enough.
12221187	eng	Did you call room service?
12221193	eng	This language is incredibly difficult.
12221194	eng	This is a volcanic island.
12221195	eng	Each child has a bicycle.
12221197	eng	Do you guys speak Lithuanian?
12221203	eng	I'm picking up a package.
12221215	eng	Ma'am, can you help me?
12221216	eng	Miss, can you help me?
12221220	eng	I didn't keep my banana.
12221228	eng	I found a suicide note.
12221229	eng	Tom is from Boston originally.
12221230	eng	Have you forgotten our plans?
12221233	eng	Do you have the stick?
12221235	eng	Tom was killed with poison.
12221236	eng	How widespread is this problem?
12221237	eng	This is an amazing coincidence.
12221302	eng	Tom often makes careless mistakes.
12221310	eng	I saw you hug Tom.
12221366	eng	I'm drinking with my friends.
12221368	eng	Tom's friends are good guys.
12221591	eng	We helped pay for it.
12221603	eng	Have you met my girlfriend?
12221640	eng	Tom left right after Mary.
12221717	eng	Tomorrow, we'll eat the leftovers.
12221718	eng	Give Tom the car keys.
12221734	eng	Have you come to help?
12221774	eng	I found it quite complicated.
12221777	eng	We've achieved nothing at all.
12221814	eng	Coyotes have a high-pitched howl.
12221868	eng	We're investigating Tom Jackson's murder.
12221875	eng	Have you been doing yoga?
12222036	eng	Did you read the warning?
12222044	eng	I guess Tom wanted this.
12222050	eng	How is your heart problem?
12222132	eng	Just a few more minutes.
12222206	eng	Have you spoken with everyone?
12222280	eng	Did you hear from Tom?
12222283	eng	Did you ask for decaf?
12222304	eng	Give Tom another chance, please.
12222307	eng	Do you know the addressee?
12222308	eng	Do you know the recipient?
12222312	eng	It's dangerous to do it.
12222313	eng	It's dangerous to do this.
12222316	eng	I'm saying I liked it.
12222328	eng	It's dangerous to be here.
12222337	eng	The boat capsizes at night.
12222355	eng	Now I'm giving the orders.
12222415	eng	Do you have any peaches?
12222418	eng	This is a temporary problem.
12222427	eng	Nature isn't cruel; it's indifferent.
12222428	eng	A coyote killed Tom's cat.
12222494	eng	When was this fort built?
12222506	eng	Tom knows what art is.
12222701	eng	It's just a small problem.
12222714	eng	Did you enjoy your supper?
12222850	eng	My parents are true bourgeois.
12222854	eng	My parents are truly square.
12222874	eng	My little brother screams loud.
12222877	eng	I'm not drunk, just tired.
12222887	eng	This is my favorite carol.
12223038	eng	I saw Tom's light on.
12223039	eng	Have you been dumped before?
12223041	eng	Tom and Mary are amazing.
12223125	eng	Did you actually kill somebody?
12223175	eng	Marika has a tumultuous personality.
12223183	eng	Mark did it for love.
12223223	eng	What's Mrs. Jackson's first name?
12223250	eng	How did this accident happen?
12223251	eng	Act like you're enjoying this.
12223254	eng	Did you run into Tom?
12223257	eng	Have you all had breakfast?
12223268	eng	I work as a salesperson.
12223282	eng	Tell me that you understand.
12223305	eng	Mary works at the supermarket.
12223306	eng	Let Tom rot in prison.
12223335	eng	Do you have any liquor?
12223356	eng	I'll give you my bicycle.
12223374	eng	Tom will visit Mary soon.
12223378	eng	Our problems are under control.
12223448	eng	You remember what happened, right?
12223530	eng	Have you brought your stuff?
12223669	eng	Did you eat lunch today?
12223688	eng	He came close to me.
12223698	eng	We usually bike to school.
12223699	eng	We usually cycle to school.
12223702	eng	The red dress suits her.
12223715	eng	Have you ever traveled overseas?
12223716	eng	That's very reassuring to me.
12223735	eng	I walked close to him.
12223736	eng	We went close to them.
12223738	eng	They came close to us.
12223741	eng	There's congestion on the motorway.
12223748	eng	Our flight has been cancelled.
12223749	eng	They teased the new pupil.
12223753	eng	I was at the theatre.
12223756	eng	What's your favourite French wine?
12223777	eng	Everyone needs to know that.
12223833	eng	Put on whatever you want.
12223852	eng	Cross that off the list.
12223897	eng	He stood up and left.
12223923	eng	Tom is a good soul.
12224036	eng	Have you been gaining weight?
12224059	eng	Did you see this coming?
12224509	eng	Did you enjoy the dinner?
12224569	eng	The thing is worth it.
12224576	eng	My daughter, you should study.
12224577	eng	My son, you should study.
12224585	eng	It's their last movie together.
12224591	eng	Mary is sick and bedridden.
12224594	eng	You were desperate, weren't you?
12224732	eng	I heard you had problems.
12224775	eng	A child isn't an adult.
12224921	eng	We chased after a cat.
12225035	eng	I spent last Christmas alone.
12225067	eng	We have to re-orient ourselves.
12225103	eng	I had the carpet shampooed.
12225104	eng	We had a great Christmas.
12225109	eng	Where were you last Christmas?
12225110	eng	Did you deliver the message?
12225119	eng	I thought you hated Christmas.
12225120	eng	I thought you loved Christmas.
12225125	eng	I got your Christmas card.
12225126	eng	I received your Christmas card.
12225130	eng	I actually don't like Christmas.
12225144	eng	Christmas is a magical time.
12225146	eng	Christmas is a special time.
12225162	eng	My Christmas wish came true.
12225163	eng	I crawled like a seal.
12225170	eng	Are you excited about Christmas?
12225194	eng	How was the Christmas party?
12225197	eng	How can anybody hate Christmas?
12225203	eng	How did you celebrate Christmas?
12225260	eng	Are you still taking siestas?
12225262	eng	He cannot comment on Facebook.
12225267	eng	Tom is in police custody.
12225323	eng	The chickens started a co-op.
12225362	eng	Have you been in love?
12225364	eng	This is a complicated story.
12225367	eng	Did you encounter any difficulties?
12225401	eng	Tom came to get you.
12225535	eng	This is a complicated relationship.
12225539	eng	Did you check on Tom?
12225567	eng	That happened just before Christmas.
12225579	eng	Christmas Day is almost here.
12225581	eng	Christmas is in the air.
12225588	eng	I had the strangest cravings.
12225589	eng	Tom helped me get ready.
12225607	eng	I lost a few dollars.
12225609	eng	Who'll give me a ride?
12225611	eng	Tom is smiling at us.
12225612	eng	I'd like some wine, please.
12225631	eng	Your problems are my problems.
12225700	eng	You're welcome to come inside.
12225707	eng	Tom spaces out a lot.
12225724	eng	Have you ever won anything?
12225763	eng	I bought you a beer.
12225785	eng	I saw Tom going out.
12225787	eng	You're so cute right now.
12225789	eng	Tom helped load the truck.
12225829	eng	Did you find your wallet?
12225838	eng	He did not drink today.
12225839	eng	He has not drunk today.
12225863	eng	Tom went there last year.
12225864	eng	Have you added any salt?
12225913	eng	We all die one day.
12225940	eng	That must be Tom's father.
12225944	eng	I need someone with me.
12226115	eng	Take care of everything else.
12226219	eng	Tom only started running recently.
12226302	eng	I saw Tom was happy.
12226374	eng	I want it for Tom.
12226427	eng	What was the problem exactly?
12226511	eng	Have you seen Tom drunk?
12226515	eng	I heard about that fire.
12226523	eng	Tom may be a fighter.
12226609	eng	Have you forgotten about Tom?
12226636	eng	The athlete injured her foot.
12226785	eng	I found a job today.
12226795	eng	Have you all eaten already?
12226797	eng	Your wish might come true.
12226839	eng	I saw you shoot Tom.
12226841	eng	You've given it your all!
12226848	eng	Rain or shine, we'll go.
12226894	eng	Which way should we head?
12226897	eng	This is getting too complicated.
12226903	eng	Have you ever been stabbed?
12226970	eng	I found something really amazing.
12226975	eng	Do you have any dependents?
12227198	eng	Tom must be partying again.
12227201	eng	Did you bring a raincoat?
12227224	eng	I help whenever I can.
12227227	eng	Are you all ready now?
12227228	eng	Now I take medication regularly.
12227229	eng	Nobody would let me in.
12227232	eng	We've lowered our prices further.
12227234	eng	Show me where they're going.
12227270	eng	Have I missed a payment?
12227279	eng	That was where Tom lived.
12227296	eng	And now let's forget everything.
12227321	eng	The weather couldn't be better.
12227331	eng	We'll see each other Wednesday.
12227351	eng	Alexander often visits the supermarket.
12227373	eng	I'm not hurting you guys.

12227400	eng	Nothing depends on you anymore.
12227406	eng	Do you remember hitting Tom?
12227407	eng	Have you ever been convicted?
12227508	eng	Did you see Tom again?
12227555	eng	Why are you buying that?
12227581	eng	Matter is also just vibration.
12227583	eng	This teacher teaches foreign languages.
12227599	eng	Did you all have fun?
12227681	eng	I asked around for Tom.
12227695	eng	That could never happen here.
12227850	eng	I think that Tom's ill.
12227903	eng	Tom went home at 6.30.
12227904	eng	Who ate the last doughnut?
12227905	eng	Who had the last doughnut?

12227932	eng	Tom helped make this happen.
12227937	eng	Have you all been well?
12227942	eng	You've helped enough already today.
12228024	eng	Can you stop a minute?
12228245	eng	Now Tom wants it back.
12228289	eng	I slept with a Breton.
12228297	eng	Do you see the chamois?
12228301	eng	Chamois almost never drink water.
12228305	eng	What are you selling here?
12228335	eng	Even a flea can bite.
12228336	eng	Is a flea an insect?
12228367	eng	The jar's handle is broken.
12228391	eng	Tell Tom about the movie.
12228397	eng	Nobody is taking us seriously.
12228463	eng	I made your favorite dessert.
12228466	eng	I can hear him whistling.
12228563	eng	Where did you catch Tom?
12228585	eng	Tom calls his toad Viktor.
12228620	eng	Your editor will be excited.
12228629	eng	Have you ever tried meditation?

12228681	eng	Tom is a corpulent man.
12228741	eng	Did you enjoy your Christmas?
12228744	eng	Franchising is our next step.
12228787	eng	I saw something very interesting.
12228789	eng	That's what Tom thought, too.
12228792	eng	Lawyers are all the same.
12228892	eng	Nobody ever asked me anything.
12228900	eng	Tom is a firearms instructor.
12228972	eng	She gave birth to me.

12229272	eng	My first name is Tom.
12229289	eng	Did you see a chef?
12229290	eng	Did you see a cook?
12229294	eng	Have you fed the chickens?
12229299	eng	A person must be honest.
12229301	eng	I really like my work.
12229304	eng	Did you see who came?
12229314	eng	We were both extremely lucky.
12229319	eng	Have you read Tom's thesis?
12229321	eng	Our problems have been solved.
12229332	eng	We're reiterating the same promises.
12229359	eng	You're really sleepy, aren't you?
12229361	eng	I made a small mistake.
12229365	eng	Tom looked into my eyes.
12229366	eng	Tom stared into my eyes.
12229369	eng	The pig's tail is curled.
12229374	eng	This is an urgent problem.
12229384	eng	They will kill you all.
12229393	eng	Tom may tell his parents.
12229456	eng	I spoke to Tom's assistant.
12229457	eng	Did you all enjoy it?
12229476	eng	He is looking for work.
12229528	eng	I was interviewing the suspects.
12229549	eng	Tom was always very headstrong.
12229551	eng	Did you brush your hair?
12229728	eng	I found that quite amusing.
12229729	eng	I saw Tom get hurt.
12229731	eng	Did you ask for something?
12229780	eng	Tom needs to stay quiet.
12229781	eng	How did this accident occur?
12229961	eng	Have you paid your dues?
12230046	eng	She's possessed by a demon.
12230047	eng	She speaks English relatively well.
12230048	eng	This is a huge problem.
12230052	eng	Did the police discover anything?
12230091	eng	I found that really strange.
12230246	eng	Tom had a full recovery.
12230345	eng	She didn't even say hi.
12230426	eng	I said that with pride.
12230431	eng	You helped make this possible.
12230452	eng	You're definitely not that old.
12230467	eng	Did you drive all night?
12230489	eng	We have to invent it.
12230582	eng	I'll be arriving on Christmas.
12230668	eng	You'll understand all this eventually.
12230681	eng	Could that be the problem?
12230704	eng	We're spending Christmas in Austria.
12230734	eng	It's never hot on Christmas.
12230736	eng	Vladimir got presents on Christmas.
12230737	eng	Ah, is it already Christmas?
12230739	eng	Sometimes it snows on Christmas.
12230779	eng	Did you check Tom's room?
12230782	eng	Have you ever been tobogganing?
12230868	eng	Tom is a bit nuts.
12231156	eng	Tom probably jumped to conclusions.
12231158	eng	I saw what Tom wrote.
12231159	eng	Have you spoken to everyone?
12231165	eng	The documentation is quite good.
12231185	eng	We must summon a spirit.

12231243	eng	Have you learned a lot?
12231266	eng	Tell us about the problem.
12231307	eng	I saw you take something.
12231308	eng	Tom and I tried that.

12231519	eng	I'll ring you every morning.
12231520	eng	I'll phone you each morning.
12231525	eng	This is a complicated business.
12231531	eng	Could you describe the problem?
12231534	eng	I'm cold. Close the window.
12231554	eng	I'm the one who's ill.
12231560	eng	I knitted him a jumper.

12231573	eng	That's the colour of raspberries.
12231578	eng	He was absent during registration.
12231592	eng	The pupils are on holiday.
12231599	eng	What flavour is this yoghurt?
12231600	eng	He is not a pupil.
12231646	eng	She is a nursery-school teacher.
12231685	eng	Tell me about your date.
12231686	eng	Have you seen Tom's resume?
12231687	eng	Did you come with somebody?
12231717	eng	You have to motivate yourself.
12231726	eng	The Sun disappeared behind clouds.
12231729	eng	Tomorrow I'm going to Hamburg.
12231734	eng	It is free for you.
12231738	eng	Tom made the honor roll.
12231742	eng	Are you all getting hungry?
12231744	eng	This machine will suppress it.
12231746	eng	It's like a prison here.
12231749	eng	We're not looking at you.
12231764	eng	He pronounces this word incorrectly.
12231765	eng	We know that it's prohibited.
12231770	eng	Columbus didn't have a telephone.
12231771	eng	Since when can cockroaches fly?
12231772	eng	The door was boarded up.
12231777	eng	Wikipedia is a multilingual website.
12231778	eng	I told you the truth!
12231816	eng	You must really love Tom.
12231819	eng	Have you all gone insane?
12231874	eng	You really are so predictable.
12231968	eng	I was Tom's emergency contact.
12231978	eng	Don't leave me! Not now!
12231980	eng	Tatoeba has some strange sentences.
12231981	eng	Oh! Where'd you come from?
12231984	eng	He pressed on the brakes.
12231988	eng	This is a two-story house.
12231996	eng	Why doesn't anyone believe him?
12232002	eng	I only have one remark.
12232005	eng	As if it changes anything.
12232042	eng	Have you checked your temperature?
12232085	eng	Have you seen Tom's pictures?
12232201	eng	I spoke with the manager.
12232202	eng	You were making him mad.
12232207	eng	It's the champion who wins.
12232281	eng	Which rules did Tom break?
12232282	eng	Have you thought of quitting?

12232779	eng	Tom and Mary were brilliant.
12232781	eng	How is this your problem?
12232805	eng	Did you enjoy your day?
12232831	eng	Memory has to be exercised.
12232835	eng	You do nothing all day.
12232843	eng	Turn it off right now!
12232850	eng	We don't understand anything, either.
12232851	eng	We don't understand anything ourselves.
12232856	eng	We don't count on them.
12232869	eng	Why are you slowing down?
12232894	eng	Tom put me at ease.
12232983	eng	I spoke to Tom once.
12233100	eng	Would you like a brandy?
12233182	eng	Have you ever been camping?
12233200	eng	The patient needs urgent surgery.
12233202	eng	I never played this game.
12233204	eng	Where'd you buy this wine?
12233206	eng	You think she was killed?
12233213	eng	This says a lot already.
12233216	eng	My uncle is a doctor.
12233232	eng	I was a free man.
12233281	eng	Could you explain the problem?
12233322	eng	I had a large soda.
12233327	eng	Have you read the inscription?
12233340	eng	I do other people's work.
12233352	eng	She doesn't do her job.
12233395	eng	What are the three possibilities?
12233405	eng	Mary had a good meal.
12233436	eng	The law was unanimously adopted.
12233448	eng	The law is unanimously adopted.
12233450	eng	They argued about a triviality.
12233465	eng	But her nose isn't pretty.
12233477	eng	Have a nice summer vacation!
12233514	eng	He almost missed his plane.
12233563	eng	Did you really meet Tom?
12233567	eng	Have you all forgotten already?
12233615	eng	He's said to be rich.
12233618	eng	She's said to be rich.
12233620	eng	Go back to your story!
12233624	eng	I didn't bring any luggage.
12233700	eng	Did you check your tires?
12233775	eng	This production has enough specialists.
12233782	eng	When will I see him?
12233800	eng	How is that a problem?
12234000	eng	Tom can solve your problem.
12234247	eng	Tell me about your symptoms.
12234678	eng	Tom helped fix the leak.
12234978	eng	Have you told Tom everything?
12235076	eng	I found my birth certificate.
12235079	eng	Did you check the drawer?
12235103	eng	Grandpa learned Russian in Siberia.
12235114	eng	What is a language, actually?

12235116	eng	Actually, what is a language?
12235135	eng	What did the boss say?
12235149	eng	This house was built recently.
12235152	eng	Don't tell people the truth.
12235163	eng	That knowledge is very useful.
12235164	eng	You always wear black. Why?
12235203	eng	I remember her a lot.
12235287	eng	This is a practical book.
12235309	eng	Overall, that is the problem.
12235353	eng	Stay away from this pond.

12235423	eng	Let's drink and sing merrily.
12235429	eng	I tried but wasn't successful.
12235435	eng	I saw you get arrested.
12235439	eng	Tom's face is perfectly symmetrical.
12235450	eng	Welcome to our new shop.
12235453	eng	Which way is the bar?
12235469	eng	I have nothing against women.
12235470	eng	Tom fought with the intruder.
12235471	eng	Have you nothing to report?
12235480	eng	This is a major problem.
12235482	eng	Why would Mary kill herself?
12235494	eng	Tom ate too much candy.
12235510	eng	Have I met you somewhere?
12235533	eng	I want all that back.
12235551	eng	Tell me about the scandal.

12235761	eng	Nobody else could've done that.
12235769	eng	Did you face any problems?
12235774	eng	He's been ringing me constantly.
12235785	eng	I'm not interested in sport.
12235788	eng	Let's stop for a pee.

12239332	eng	Where can I sign up?
12239359	eng	Did you and Tom fight?
12239369	eng	Have you cleaned the bathroom?
12239436	eng	They wanted to adopt you.
12239554	eng	He learned French by himself.
12239620	eng	Do you have the blueprints?
12239666	eng	I used to have nightmares.
12239697	eng	Were you a problem child?
12239704	eng	It's so easy to hate.
12239705	eng	A cold is an infection.
12239851	eng	Keep this secret from Tom.
12239873	eng	We helped evacuate the injured.
12239877	eng	What happened to that tree?
12239883	eng	I saw Tom was shivering.
12239884	eng	Have you deposited the money?
12239891	eng	Did you buy a ticket?
12239947	eng	I glued the parts together.
12240114	eng	Have you consulted a doctor?
12240119	eng	We already have a buyer.
12240122	eng	I enjoyed talking with Antonio.

12240127	eng	I want to help, too.
12240128	eng	I saw Tom in Australia.
12240129	eng	Did you buy new shoes?
12240139	eng	This game is really complicated.
12240170	eng	Have you found a roommate?
12240173	eng	I made a doctor's appointment.
12240175	eng	You're living beyond your means.
12240187	eng	Tom said we should fight.
12240225	eng	Tom destroyed all the evidence.
12240387	eng	My dad told me off.
12240390	eng	I ran to the scene.
12240582	eng	The frost hurt our garden.
12240584	eng	Tom and Mary trust you.
12240586	eng	Have you ever considered therapy?
12240622	eng	Someone out there knows something.
12240654	eng	I have a chocolate bar.
12240656	eng	Did you call a lawyer?
12240700	eng	Tell us about the operation.
12240705	eng	This could have disastrous consequences.
12240707	eng	Tom will be right here.
12240715	eng	Feminists instigate women against men.
12240802	eng	He refuses to cover himself.
12240903	eng	I talked to your supervisor.
12241194	eng	He is carrying a suitcase.
12241271	eng	I helped make that decision.
12241319	eng	They went fishing for bream.
12241494	eng	Show me what you like.
12241510	eng	Have you completed your investigation?
12241845	eng	I guess I'd better explain.
12241853	eng	I helped Tom get started.
12241860	eng	Did you enjoy your lunch?
12241928	eng	You didn't believe Tom then.
12242056	eng	Let me fix the problem.
12242229	eng	Did you enjoy yourself today?
12242306	eng	I heard the nightingale singing.
12242348	eng	Tom is reading a story.

12242542	eng	Does she need a shirt?
12242546	eng	Do they need a shirt?
12242549	eng	Do you have a shirt?
12242580	eng	It's a completely normal phenomenon.
12242581	eng	Her first name was Mary.
12242595	eng	Your help is greatly appreciated.
12242597	eng	I lay thinking about Tom.
12242610	eng	I can go to college.
12242611	eng	I can go to university.
12242663	eng	I had left a message.
12242680	eng	Tom sounded a bit jealous.
12242692	eng	Buy this book for me!
12242717	eng	Tom helped move the piano.
12242721	eng	Tom ate all the blueberries.
12242722	eng	Did you enjoy the experience?
12242729	eng	Are you talking about headhunting?
12242889	eng	He saved me from death.
12242897	eng	He mixes couscous and bread.
12242903	eng	Guess what Tom just said.
12243024	eng	Tom may be down here.
12243127	eng	I ran into some problems.
12243132	eng	Did you tell Tom this?
12243137	eng	Have you been fired already?
12243277	eng	Did you burn those blankets?
12243303	eng	Let's take one of them.

12243414	eng	Don't you guys want it?
12243418	eng	Don't you guys like it?
12243446	eng	She ended up all alone.
12243473	eng	Which way was Tom heading?
12243478	eng	Are you alone a lot?
12243496	eng	The opening is too small.
12243617	eng	That's casting pearls before swine!
12243629	eng	He hasn't been seen since.
12243658	eng	Do not pull the trigger.
12243826	eng	Have you eaten lunch already?
12243844	eng	I don't have classes tomorrow.
12243848	eng	I only see them together.

12244959	eng	Which train did Tom take?
12244965	eng	Have you ever had mumps?
12245040	eng	Where is my sleeping bag?
12245061	eng	Tom landed on his back.
12245071	eng	Did you argue against it?
12245179	eng	8 - 4 is subtraction.
12245184	eng	I'm not playing their game.
12245186	eng	We're going to bed now.

12246893	eng	I saw Tom walk by.
12246945	eng	That gummy just kicked in.
12247032	eng	We could actually do that.
12247061	eng	Could you stop that, please?

12247368	eng	He never caught our eye.
12247379	eng	She never caught his eye.
12247407	eng	Did you buy these flowers?
12247480	eng	Did you burn your fingers?
12247500	eng	Tom and I share Mary.
12247505	eng	Come out to the porch.
12247512	eng	You aren't a soldier anymore.
12247514	eng	Do you have a wrench?
12247520	eng	Mary looks like a boy.
12247530	eng	Sometimes, things just get complicated.
12247532	eng	Was the case very complicated?
12247556	eng	I want a frank opinion.

12247748	eng	This happened because of you.
12247763	eng	Do you have a spanner?
12247766	eng	Welcome to my humble adobe.

12247817	eng	What did he tell her?
12247820	eng	What did he tell him?
12247827	eng	Tell her we said congratulations.

12248551	eng	Tom needs to stay home.
12248592	eng	Everybody calm the fuck down!
12248642	eng	Which way is the pool?
12248736	eng	Tom didn't collect his reward.
12248802	eng	This is a complicated job.

12251415	eng	Did you eat this morning?
12251574	eng	She is hidden at home.
12251579	eng	Maybe Tom got chased off.
12251585	eng	Which group are you in?
12251604	eng	There's nothing he can do.
12251605	eng	There's nothing she can do.

12251810	eng	Tell Tom to find Mary.
12251861	eng	It was hard as stone.
12251862	eng	They haven't given us anything.
12251887	eng	I knew every man there.
12251937	eng	What does Tom care about?
12251983	eng	I found that very strange.
12252010	eng	Only death can part us.
12252017	eng	Which train are we taking?
12252042	eng	Did you shut the cages?
12252052	eng	I heard about the disagreement.
12252076	eng	Help me solve this problem.
12252079	eng	Have you seen Tom's drawings?
12252148	eng	Tell me about the avalanche.
12252184	eng	You helped us a lot.
12252212	eng	It's just protecting its territory.
12252226	eng	Which way was Tom going?
12252258	eng	Don't let Tom drink this.
12252292	eng	This is complicated for me.
12252332	eng	Did you ask for permission?
12252420	eng	Will that present a problem?
12252487	eng	You can ride with Tom.
12252608	eng	Are you afraid of water?
12252725	eng	I like talking about Tom.

12252896	eng	Someone thought I was Tom.
12252903	eng	Who's the president of America?
12252964	eng	I feel so alone now.

12253301	eng	Meet me in the cafeteria.
12253648	eng	Will that become a problem?
12253649	eng	I know it sounds complicated.
12253650	eng	Will that be a problem?
12253733	eng	Hopefully, Tom will be there.
12253741	eng	I had a bad childhood.
12253785	eng	Please glue these parts together.
12253829	eng	How is that your problem?
12253844	eng	Have you changed the batteries?

12254302	eng	You have to punish Tom.
12254590	eng	I heard about your courage.
12254595	eng	Are you all not eating?
12254654	eng	Has Tom been acting weird?
12254655	eng	Have you seen the plans?
12254952	eng	Let me be your mentor.
12255237	eng	I heard Tom got suspended.
12255552	eng	Have you met Tom already?
12255557	eng	Which one is the newest?

12255627	eng	I've eaten, but not much.
12255636	eng	Are we riding our bikes?
12255638	eng	But yes, by the way!
12255643	eng	This concept is very complicated.
12255646	eng	Acne appeared on Tom's nose.
12255681	eng	Iodine's atomic number is 53.
12255685	eng	He loves himself too much.
12255687	eng	You love me too much.
12255692	eng	I spoke to Tom today.
12255695	eng	Would you like a balloon?
12255721	eng	Have you ever been fishing?
12255730	eng	I unfortunately have no idea.
12255734	eng	Tom will definitely survive it.
12255768	eng	Snails and slugs are gastropods.
12255777	eng	You should be the best.
12255796	eng	A great disaster befell him.
12255809	eng	I can stay with Tom.
12255813	eng	Did you clean it properly?
12255818	eng	You guys accepted those gifts.
12255832	eng	The plate is colored white.
12255833	eng	What is the fifth thing?
12255849	eng	I remembered you're my sibling.
12255852	eng	What is hard to understand?

12256157	eng	I don't like that comparison.
12256178	eng	Should I reply in English?
12256184	eng	Is Tom really not well?
12256216	eng	You are a fucking cunt.
12256218	eng	He is a fucking cunt.
12256280	eng	I'll follow your advice immediately.
12256325	eng	It's nothing serious, I hope?
12256326	eng	I suffer from stage fright.
12256346	eng	I talked to a reporter.
12256348	eng	Did you try calling Tom?
12256349	eng	Besides, I didn't see anything.
12256351	eng	I didn't see anything, anyway.

12256709	eng	Oh, I've forgotten my camera!
12256721	eng	I'll forgive you this once.
12256727	eng	Shouldn't I have done that?
12256742	eng	I still haven't done anything.
12256772	eng	What precisely happened here yesterday?
12256777	eng	What exactly happened here yesterday?
12257029	eng	Parting is such sweet sorrow.
12257036	eng	Have you had difficulty sleeping?
12257092	eng	He was at loose ends.
12257118	eng	Regular exercise improves sleep quality.
12257142	eng	I heard about your resignation.
12257244	eng	This is for them all.
12257373	eng	What are you really asking?
12257461	eng	Have you invited your friends?
12257610	eng	Did you see the explosion?
12257728	eng	"What's that?" "It's a booger."
12257763	eng	I'm worried about my children.
12257772	eng	And why hasn't Tom come?
12257773	eng	And why didn't Tom come?
12257789	eng	Have you seen the garden?
12257815	eng	Give Tom more space, please.
12257858	eng	Which room is Tom in?
12257859	eng	Did you bring your sweater?

12257894	eng	He's wearing a gray dress.
12257897	eng	He's wearing a gray robe.
12257917	eng	That theory is completely insane.
12257961	eng	Is everybody stark raving mad?
12258045	eng	I helped a little bit.
12258048	eng	Did Tom hurt you guys?
12258058	eng	They didn't eat the cake.
12258074	eng	You gave them to him.
12258076	eng	You gave them to her.
12258088	eng	He slept on his back.

12258336	eng	The balance sheet is sobering.
12258339	eng	I had the lamb stew.
12258340	eng	Have you apologized to Tom?
12258345	eng	"Thank you!" "You're welcome, ma'am!"
12258346	eng	"Thank you!" "You're welcome, miss!"

12258796	eng	Tom is a radio commentator.
12258802	eng	You guys only incite violence.

12258818	eng	What was it like outside?
12258835	eng	Ali is a Tunisian Turk.
12258958	eng	Neither of my parents smoke.
12258996	eng	Tom, what would you say?
12259039	eng	Which way was Tom facing?

12261030	eng	I've finished cleaning the house.
12261128	eng	The children are still small.
12261129	eng	I represented guys like Tom.
12261132	eng	I feel that you're lying.
12261142	eng	I needed some alone time.
12261163	eng	Did you steal Tom's girlfriend?
12261165	eng	People are full of surprises.
12261181	eng	Have you rehearsed your speech?
12261232	eng	Did you ring Tom's doorbell?
12261234	eng	I'd like to do something.

12262238	eng	He left early this morning.
12262247	eng	I admire your professional abilities.

12262289	eng	Dad and Mom aren't coming.
12262330	eng	He was sharpening his knife.
12262331	eng	Did you pray for this?
12262332	eng	I'd never be that desperate.

12262488	eng	Tom was the only volunteer.
12262492	eng	I'll do whatever Tom says.
12262494	eng	Please do me a favor.
12262535	eng	You should've mentioned that sooner.
12262553	eng	Did you get any salsa?
12262554	eng	I usually come here alone.
12262563	eng	Tom showed it to us.
12262565	eng	I'd really rather do nothing.
12262570	eng	Have you given blood recently?

12262912	eng	I'd like to clarify this.
12263039	eng	Tom did that almost instantly.
12263044	eng	You should've come back sooner.
12263047	eng	Did you pick up anything?
12263138	eng	Did you get us drinks?
12263180	eng	Tom rushed up the stairs.
12263189	eng	I feel a bit worried.
12263236	eng	Did you have Tom killed?
12263237	eng	I'd like to try rollerblading.
12263284	eng	Financial help is sorely needed.

12263372	eng	Why is he doing that?
12263479	eng	It's not in my nature.
12263511	eng	Did you say Tom died?
12263516	eng	Do you have any sherry?
12263522	eng	I feel a bit cold.
12263525	eng	I need to rush home.
12263590	eng	Tom sent us a letter.
12263592	eng	I feel much calmer now.
12263596	eng	You should've locked your door.
12263663	eng	Our factory is on fire.
12263681	eng	Tom has a bad fever.
12263689	eng	I've been doing this alone.
12263738	eng	I think we found Tom.
12263740	eng	You should've spoken more quietly.
12263748	eng	Our job has just begun.
12263758	eng	I'd like to accompany you.
12263759	eng	My life was getting complicated.
12263760	eng	Did you lose some weight?
12263765	eng	Tom drives his grandfather's car.
12263766	eng	The house has no roof.
12263768	eng	Don't think about the earth.
12263777	eng	Our weapons have been stolen.
12263778	eng	Do you like the movies?
12263790	eng	Did you guys have breakfast?
12263794	eng	Is your wife a believer?
12263797	eng	I must do it alone.
12263809	eng	I feel like a fraud.
12263810	eng	I assumed you lived alone.
12263828	eng	Our prestige is at stake.
12263829	eng	Did you get your key?
12263855	eng	I feel groggy and lethargic.
12263857	eng	Did you receive the application?
12263875	eng	Tom is a clumsy person.
12263883	eng	Did you hear Tom's answer?
12263893	eng	I seldom go camping alone.
12263898	eng	The heat is slowly fading.
12263899	eng	The heat is gradually easing.
12263921	eng	Tom's house is just ahead.
12263923	eng	I feel like wearing red.
12263927	eng	Our employees can do that.
12263930	eng	"What's Sven's nationality?" "He's Danish."
12263931	eng	This novel is too dull.
12263955	eng	Our main concern was secrecy.
12264067	eng	Our homes have been destroyed.
12264074	eng	I would've asked more questions.
12264077	eng	I was born in 1952.
12264101	eng	Donations are now being accepted.
12264119	eng	We are open for business!
12264120	eng	We are open for business.
12264188	eng	Tom has a sports car.
12264192	eng	You should've done this before.
12264193	eng	Did you talk about marriage?
12264210	eng	When you teach, you learn.
12264233	eng	Did you really make that?
12264235	eng	You should've paid closer attention.
12264237	eng	Our fathers like each other.
12264243	eng	To teach is to learn.
12264283	eng	Did you tell any lies?
12264318	eng	Everything is open to negotiation.
12264321	eng	Our fates are already decided.
12264403	eng	Did you go back inside?
12264408	eng	Our rights have been violated.
12264498	eng	Our firm is very small.
12264543	eng	I wanted to make one.
12264553	eng	I was scared and alone.
12264557	eng	I would've followed you anywhere.
12264615	eng	I feel much, much better.
12264637	eng	She was sharpening her knife.
12264660	eng	Is he going to die?
12264693	eng	No, sorry, it's not acceptable.
12264694	eng	No, sorry, it's not good.
12264711	eng	My professor is very strict.
12264719	eng	You're going to be alone.
12264778	eng	Do you guys speak Albanian?
12264806	eng	Did you take Tom's pulse?
12264810	eng	We needed some alone time.
12264891	eng	Our weapons have been destroyed.
12265000	eng	I feel like dancing tonight.
12265058	eng	You should've shown more respect.
12265059	eng	I would've really liked that.
12265158	eng	I'd like a new car.
12265195	eng	You should've thrown everything away.
12265197	eng	Did you get any beer?
12265203	eng	Tom made me a sandwich.
12265205	eng	Tom made us some sandwiches.
12265208	eng	Did you take drama classes?
12265209	eng	Our dreams can come true.
12265248	eng	I no longer love her.
12265254	eng	You are no longer alone.
12265259	eng	Tom said he saw you.
12265261	eng	My parents grew up here.
12265309	eng	Did you hear Tom's confession?
12265311	eng	Pardon me for one second.
12265312	eng	You should've let us help.
12265313	eng	And now let us talk.
12265319	eng	Children learn, and adults work.
12265335	eng	She refused to say more.
12265337	eng	Mum and Dad aren't coming.
12265348	eng	I ring her every evening.
12265350	eng	I ring him every evening.
12265369	eng	You'll easily find a job.
12265372	eng	Tom is at the station.
12265391	eng	She bought herself a coat.
12265392	eng	She's bought herself a coat.
12265393	eng	He bought himself a coat.
12265394	eng	He's bought himself a coat.
12265405	eng	Bring me something to drink.
12265408	eng	Will you let me explain?
12265417	eng	It smells of strong coffee.
12265419	eng	It smells strongly of coffee.
12265427	eng	I thought Tom worked alone.
12265431	eng	This doesn't really make sense.
12265432	eng	It doesn't really make sense.
12265441	eng	You've got some strange ideas.
12265442	eng	You've got some strange ideas!
12265469	eng	This apple tastes pleasantly sweet.
12265481	eng	Tom wants to eat noodles.
12265546	eng	I feel like hugging everyone.
12265548	eng	Did you voice your suspicion?
12265551	eng	I'd never wear a wig.
12265568	eng	Tom has always lived alone.
12265570	eng	I feel a bit ridiculous.
12265577	eng	You used to like it.
12265606	eng	Did you get something good?
12265654	eng	Did you get some dinner?
12265656	eng	You should've told me yourself.
12265752	eng	You should've told me everything.
12265756	eng	Our dreams are coming true.
12265880	eng	My income is very low.
12265893	eng	This is interesting, isn't it?
12265899	eng	You have some strange ideas.
12265951	eng	Did you read Tom's emails?
12265958	eng	Did you understand that joke?
12266042	eng	Tom has confessed the truth.
12266045	eng	I'd like to keep trying.
12266087	eng	Did you know Tom smoked?
12266128	eng	I feel kind of tense.
12266206	eng	I feel pretty lousy today.
12266209	eng	I'll be working alone tonight.
12266212	eng	Have you seen the script?
12266290	eng	I feel kind of woozy.
12266297	eng	Tom doesn't believe in anything.
12266302	eng	Tom has been studying hard.
12266306	eng	Pardon me just a moment.
12266408	eng	Who else knows you're here?
12266418	eng	I want to call him.
12266419	eng	I'd like to call him.
12266425	eng	Tom and Mary are alcoholics.
12266426	eng	I feel kind of embarrassed.
12266427	eng	Did you get your schedule?
12266429	eng	I'd like to call Tom.
12266435	eng	Do you know Tom's sons?
12266438	eng	You should've waited at home.
12266448	eng	She only speaks about politics.
12266452	eng	Tom's parents are both dentists.
12266455	eng	I feel like going jogging.
12266480	eng	I really hate being alone.
12266482	eng	Did you go to preschool?
12266484	eng	I got drunk on wine.
12266507	eng	I feel safe right now.
12266508	eng	You should have it fixed.
12266542	eng	I'd better leave Tom alone.
12266544	eng	I think it'll be useful.
12266627	eng	What's the capital of Taiwan?
12266634	eng	I'd like to be informed.
12266636	eng	I'd like to escort you.
12266639	eng	Tom left the room last.
12266641	eng	It's difficult to estimate distance.
12266687	eng	Tonight's party will be boring.
12266692	eng	You should've seen a doctor.
12266693	eng	She arrived in Tokyo yesterday.
12266699	eng	It isn't that far away.
12266702	eng	This is just an estimate.
12266712	eng	Tom's translation isn't very good.
12266773	eng	Tom walked back home alone.
12266777	eng	Our honeymoon has just begun.
12266916	eng	Have you been out today?
12266918	eng	Have you been anywhere today?
12266920	eng	Have you been out yet?
12266950	eng	They are interested in us.
12266952	eng	They were a great success.
12266953	eng	Mary was unbearably moody yesterday.
12266954	eng	Mary was unbearably temperamental yesterday.
12266955	eng	That's a lot of people!
12266956	eng	That's a lot of people.
12266962	eng	Her skirt has three buttons.
12266963	eng	Her skirt's got three buttons.
12266964	eng	Your skirt has three buttons.
12266965	eng	We really need to talk.
12266969	eng	It's just easier like this.
12266970	eng	It's just easier this way.
12266972	eng	It's just simpler this way.
12266977	eng	Nurses take care of patients.
12266988	eng	I can read it later.
12267036	eng	Did you not see that?
12267038	eng	I thought this was illegal.
12267078	eng	I'd prefer to stay home.
12267086	eng	Why were you in Chad?
12267100	eng	Don't bother me. I'm busy.
12267102	eng	Put me to the test.
12267110	eng	I'm standing outside the synagogue.
12267112	eng	Turn right after the synagogue.
12267119	eng	Did you know Tom died?
12267123	eng	You should've thought this over.
12267127	eng	Did you really fall down?
12267149	eng	Did you withdraw the money?
12267151	eng	I'd very much appreciate that.
12267157	eng	I needed some time alone.
12267241	eng	I know Tom and Mary.
12267250	eng	Did you know this before?
12267321	eng	Let me handle this alone.
12267429	eng	Did you like Tom's party?
12267435	eng	You should've called us immediately.
12267528	eng	Tom is exaggerating a little.
12267533	eng	That can't not disconcert me.
12267536	eng	That can only disconcert me.
12267545	eng	His condolences were not welcome.
12267553	eng	This can only disconcert me.
12267609	eng	She never talked about that.
12267610	eng	Every pharaoh has a Moses.
12267614	eng	Do you know this channel?
12267616	eng	Behind it is a café.
12267623	eng	It's cooled down a lot.
12267629	eng	Too much confidence is harmful.
12267631	eng	When did you eat dinner?
12267637	eng	Did you think Tom cared?
12267638	eng	I feel kind of apprehensive.
12267677	eng	Hello, can I help you?
12267693	eng	He's aware of his mistake.
12267694	eng	She's aware of her mistake.
12267696	eng	We haven't visited New Zealand.
12267698	eng	The book is about China.
12267723	eng	Mary doesn't believe in unicorns.
12267729	eng	You should've bet more money.
12267732	eng	The army died of hunger.
12267733	eng	The army starved to death.
12267758	eng	He can play the xylophone.
12267820	eng	You should've called much earlier.
12267825	eng	You should've retired years ago.
12267876	eng	Tom might not be alone.
12267940	eng	Did you get a refund?
12267941	eng	People are looking for answers.
12267944	eng	You should've just said yes.
12267978	eng	I feel a bit relieved.
12267979	eng	Did you vomit any blood?
12267997	eng	Thank you for saving Tom.
12267998	eng	I know every Canadian here.
12268000	eng	I felt a bit lonely.
12268002	eng	Did you get hurt badly?
12268006	eng	I'll have to face it.
12268027	eng	The unicorn's horn is golden.
12268028	eng	Tom seems a bit nervous.
12268029	eng	The unicorn's horn is ebony.
12268040	eng	I'd love to go home.
12268042	eng	Did you guys learn anything?
12268043	eng	I'd love to try snowboarding.
12268045	eng	Tom won't laugh at that.
12268046	eng	Tom wouldn't laugh at that.
12268063	eng	Did you worry about us?
12268068	eng	A little boy greeted me.
12268113	eng	You're working part-time, aren't you?
12268121	eng	People are capable of anything.
12268122	eng	Are you alone in here?
12268123	eng	I feel happy for you.
12268129	eng	I think Tom needs rest.
12268130	eng	Nobody can figure it out.
12268137	eng	Shovelling snow is hard work.
12268140	eng	You should get it repaired.
12268141	eng	You should get it fixed.
12268154	eng	I'm not lonely any more.
12268162	eng	He's not lonely any more.
12268163	eng	He isn't lonely any more.
12268173	eng	It's no longer a secret.
12268174	eng	It's no secret any more.
12268175	eng	A car ran over him.
12268176	eng	A car ran him over.
12268190	eng	He watched a Swedish film.
12268196	eng	I have all the information.
12268198	eng	Mary seems to be OK.
12268202	eng	Tom is making coffee, right?
12268205	eng	Tom didn't have sunglasses on.
12268228	eng	You should've done your homework.
12268229	eng	Did you try to negotiate?
12268230	eng	You should've written me first.
12268264	eng	Our mission could be dangerous.
12268307	eng	Did you lie about Tom?
12268308	eng	Did you get a reservation?
12268407	eng	Tom passed out from dehydration.
12268412	eng	The floors were being sanded.
12268472	eng	This chapter is in English.
12268474	eng	Our documents have been stolen.
12268486	eng	Did you make this jelly?
12268498	eng	Let's go take a bath.
12268506	eng	Shouldn't we go back home?
12268544	eng	John was born in Guyana.

12268598	eng	Our message has been delivered.
12268687	eng	Did you steal Tom's jacket?
12268689	eng	I'd like to go running.
12268702	eng	You should've said this before.
12268766	eng	Tom must be feeling better.
12268770	eng	You should've consulted with me.
12268774	eng	You should've asked us first.
12269020	eng	Tom should know about it.
12269023	eng	Tom should've known about that.
12269048	eng	I would've cooked something different.
12269095	eng	I'd really love to stay.
12269098	eng	Would you rather live alone?
12269208	eng	You should've done it earlier.
12269215	eng	You should've told your family.
12269323	eng	Tom wishes to see you.
12269326	eng	John is tired of paddling.
12269328	eng	John doesn't want to paddle.
12269329	eng	I would've kept your secret.
12269331	eng	I would've told you eventually.
12269348	eng	You guys are so flexible!
12269361	eng	Did you hear Tom's voice?
12269365	eng	Did you live here long?
12269370	eng	I feel like hugging everybody.
12269413	eng	Our lives are very different.
12269447	eng	This shop has kitchen utensils.
12269486	eng	Are Tom and Mary around?
12269491	eng	I just work faster alone.
12269495	eng	I'd have to answer yes.
12269525	eng	Did you want some fries?
12269538	eng	Why are they at war?
12269539	eng	This war is a horror.
12269545	eng	You should have it laminated.
12269546	eng	Did you stop anywhere else?
12269548	eng	Our guests are almost here.
12269550	eng	He's only ten years old.
12269562	eng	I didn't find my socks!
12269586	eng	Tom needs to be protected.
12269590	eng	I feel a little lightheaded.
12269598	eng	He's as drunk as usual.
12269607	eng	What's your computer doing here?
12269608	eng	Really? When did she leave?
12269624	eng	Mary made a day trip.
12269634	eng	There was nothing he lacked.
12269635	eng	I really like sweet pineapple.
12269638	eng	Did you take Tom's keys?
12269642	eng	Our place is very small.
12269644	eng	This isn't butter. It's margarine.

12269663	eng	Kids grow up very fast.
12269664	eng	Children grow up very fast.
12269687	eng	Did you notify Tom's parents?
12269714	eng	That wasn't just a coincidence.
12269737	eng	I'd never ever hurt you.
12269756	eng	I think you've misjudged Tom.
12269757	eng	I'd like to study law.
12269758	eng	Did you forget your promise?
12269761	eng	I wanted some time alone.
12269778	eng	Artificial intelligence doesn't yet exist.
12269805	eng	You should've called us sooner.
12269808	eng	I thought you'd be mad.
12269810	eng	Summer vacation starts in July.
12269811	eng	I hate singing in public.

12269997	eng	I would've alerted you somehow.
12270020	eng	I regret not telling Tom.

12270422	eng	Tom sprinted to the door.
12270433	eng	Did you lose your home?
12270435	eng	People are depending on us.

12290202	eng	I feel really weird tonight.
12290271	eng	Did you read the pamphlet?
12290276	eng	Did you get some yogurt?
12290319	eng	The sidewalk was very slippery.
12290323	eng	What a pretty full moon!
12290326	eng	First, let's have some coffee.
12290328	eng	Let's have some coffee first.
12290337	eng	Buy me a red one.
12290343	eng	Tell us about it again.
12290348	eng	I should've quit last week.
12290362	eng	Our oldest daughter is thirteen.
12290368	eng	We'll contact you next Monday.
12290371	eng	How bad is Tom's injury?
12290375	eng	Our fears have been allayed.
12290415	eng	Tom is now very old.
12290416	eng	Did you really accept bribes?
12290436	eng	You should've done that already.
12290439	eng	Did you think I'd forgotten?
12290485	eng	You promised to come alone.
12290517	eng	Did you notice Mary's necklace?
12290521	eng	This is the rush hour.
12290642	eng	He enjoys lying to himself.
12290874	eng	He's got a cold heart.
12290879	eng	I wasn't expecting anything else.
12290977	eng	You can check with Tom.
12290980	eng	You should've honored my wishes.
12291109	eng	Tom will wait with me.
12291257	eng	Did you wrap the package?
12291259	eng	I guess Tom was hungry.
12291263	eng	Are you living here alone?
12291338	eng	You should've bought eggs instead.
12291470	eng	Don't shake it too much.
12291486	eng	I would've rather said nothing.
12291493	eng	You should've taken Tom's calls.
12291499	eng	I feel calm and relaxed.
12291506	eng	I'll tell everyone what happened.
12291579	eng	Didn't you bring a map?
12291585	eng	I'd like to hug you.
12291652	eng	I'd advise you to wait.
12291653	eng	Did you pick Tom up?
12291654	eng	Our new cook is excellent.
12291655	eng	Did you taste that rice?
12291694	eng	Do not lie to yourself.
12291695	eng	Do not lie to people.
12291731	eng	I feel so lonely here.
12291763	eng	Did you steal Tom's wallet?
12291764	eng	Did you make those cookies?
12291834	eng	Our soldiers are being killed.
12291835	eng	Did you move the furniture?
12291852	eng	I feel really dizzy now.
12291877	eng	Did you stay angry long?
12291879	eng	Did you get some lunch?
12291925	eng	Did Tom suggest I go?
12291986	eng	The crowd is growing impatient.
12291990	eng	My financial situation has changed.
12292027	eng	Have you unclogged the drain?
12292060	eng	The dining table is dirty.
12292078	eng	Water is a powerful thing.
12292083	eng	Only the end is important.
12292107	eng	I feel very isolated here.
12292111	eng	You're responsible for what happened.
12292119	eng	Who's responsible for this mess?
12292139	eng	Our house is on fire.
12292148	eng	I'd like to buy something.
12292201	eng	Are you two travelling together?
12292202	eng	Are you both travelling together?
12292210	eng	He doesn't smoke any more.
12292211	eng	She doesn't smoke any more.
12292213	eng	All the windows are shut.
12292220	eng	Have you kept your promise?
12292285	eng	Leave me alone. Just go.
12292373	eng	Did you pack my slippers?
12292380	eng	I feel so happy tonight.
12292409	eng	She was in the archive.
12292439	eng	Noble is as noble does.
12292440	eng	Birth doesn't make you noble.
12292447	eng	I would've stayed in bed.
12292506	eng	Did you steal Tom's shoes?
12292509	eng	You should've informed me earlier.
12292578	eng	Did you phone the police?
12292582	eng	Did you not do that?
12292586	eng	There are limits to everything.
12292611	eng	I'm tired of your lies.
12292648	eng	She has a pretty smile.
12292664	eng	I'd like to remain friends.
12292665	eng	How dare you hit Tom!
12292706	eng	You'd better not bother Tom.
12292720	eng	You should've done so sooner.
12292859	eng	Did you like my performance?
12292879	eng	You should've washed your face.
12293064	eng	Tom will pick up Mary.
12293160	eng	You should've never told me.
12293322	eng	Our entire family is here.
12293347	eng	The meeting takes place weekly.
12293467	eng	I'd appreciate some help now.
12293560	eng	Did you read Tom's letters?
12293561	eng	Did you run some tests?
12293563	eng	Our plan could be ruined.
12293571	eng	When is a semicolon used?
12293574	eng	I'd prefer to just leave.
12293577	eng	That must be what happened.
12293578	eng	Did you skip school again?
12293611	eng	I'd really have liked that.
12293657	eng	Tom could've done it alone.
12293658	eng	Did you punish those kids?
12293659	eng	You should've tried to understand.
12293674	eng	You should've gotten a prenup.
12293675	eng	I fired Tom last month.
12293686	eng	I feel very comfortable now.
12293690	eng	Did you really shoot Tom?
12293716	eng	Tom is probably at work.
12293718	eng	I would've never believed that.
12293721	eng	Tom tried to destroy this.
12293727	eng	Do you need help painting?
12293841	eng	I'd have to ask permission.
12293993	eng	It snowed the day before.
12294023	eng	He burned himself at home.
12294052	eng	The egret is catching fish.
12294063	eng	You should've followed your instincts.
12294067	eng	I should've done this alone.
12294074	eng	The kingfisher is catching fish.
12294233	eng	Did you overhear our conversation?
12294236	eng	Our mission is almost complete.
12294256	eng	Russia is a northern country.
12294280	eng	I feel stronger every day.
12294340	eng	I'd like to begin immediately.
12294346	eng	I can't do everything alone.
12294417	eng	Tom is a colonel now.
12294418	eng	Did you guys see anyone?
12294419	eng	I would've stayed at home.
12294634	eng	You should've trusted your instincts.
12294642	eng	I'd like to study medicine.
12294649	eng	I'm thinking about quitting smoking.
12294660	eng	How is quitting smoking going?
12294686	eng	You don't understand; it's different.
12294717	eng	Liar, liar, pants on fire.
12294727	eng	My brother has eight friends.
12294748	eng	Did you write about it?
12294760	eng	Have you checked your calendar?
12294840	eng	You should've hidden this better.
12294843	eng	Tom has given his consent.
12294846	eng	Have you met the others?
12294911	eng	Trust me, I'm a professional.
12294917	eng	You are clear for landing.
12294918	eng	You are clear for takeoff.
12294926	eng	Did you hear our conversation?
12294930	eng	I feel a little uncomfortable.
12294942	eng	I'd love to be involved.
12294957	eng	Tom will pick Mary up.
12294981	eng	I struggled to restrain myself.
12294996	eng	Tom has recently gone insane.
12295003	eng	I feel a little overdressed.
12295075	eng	This is Tom, my boyfriend.
12295077	eng	I would've never noticed that.
12295078	eng	Did you really steal this?
12295079	eng	You're the cutest, sweetest dog.
12295091	eng	I knew you were hungry.
12295096	eng	I would've finished the job.
12295098	eng	I feel a little breathless.
12295134	eng	We're taking our annual inventory.
12295152	eng	The radiator gets very hot.
12295153	eng	The heater gets very hot.
12295156	eng	Did you read my letters?
12295204	eng	I wish we were alone.
12295217	eng	Was that just an earthquake?
12295222	eng	Our dreams will come true.
12295233	eng	Did you like the casserole?
12295238	eng	Our prices are the lowest.
12295243	eng	Did you not feel lonely?
12295258	eng	Tom must have some plan.
12295260	eng	Our mothers were sorority sisters.
12295262	eng	Someone sure can fix it.
12295281	eng	Tom bought a second-hand car.
12295303	eng	Did you lose anything valuable?
12295339	eng	See you at 3 o'clock.
12295340	eng	See you at three o'clock.
12295343	eng	It happened at exactly twelve.
12295345	eng	It happened at exactly 12.00.
12295365	eng	No smoking during the performance.
12295367	eng	I can hear distant laughter.
12295392	eng	I'd prefer not to know.
12295397	eng	Will you be OK alone?
12295435	eng	My yard is a mess.
12295436	eng	My garden is a mess.
12295447	eng	I actually hate eating alone.
12295612	eng	I'd go to the left.
12295618	eng	You should've answered my letters.
12295628	eng	I really should have come!
12295681	eng	The roof rack is broken.
12295699	eng	They're preparing for possible tsunamis.
12295730	eng	Did you recognize those women?
12295791	eng	I could've handled that alone.
12295792	eng	Did you hurt yourself badly?
12295910	eng	I would've found out anyway.
12296065	eng	Did you practice your speech?
12296186	eng	I thought you kept kosher.
12296187	eng	I thought you were Jewish.
12296191	eng	I thought this was Australia.
12296196	eng	Tom will be worn out.
12296197	eng	Cookie keeps making weird noises.
12296200	eng	I feel very grown up.
12296202	eng	I feel like something's missing.
12296297	eng	Did you use my razor?
12296305	eng	Do you want some privacy?
12296378	eng	I visited Boston in October.
12296432	eng	I feel like going swimming.
12296434	eng	You should've ordered a suit.
12296435	eng	I feel disgusted with myself.
12296441	eng	Will we be alone here?
12296443	eng	Tom misses you a lot.
12296445	eng	Did you like my spaghetti?
12296447	eng	I'd never betray my country.
12296454	eng	How much can that cost?
12296482	eng	You should've taken me there.
12296484	eng	You should've let Tom go.
12296494	eng	Plums grow on plum trees.
12296527	eng	I was out there alone.
12296531	eng	Is that a wild boar?
12296535	eng	This itinerary is too long.
12296555	eng	Fleeing is part of fighting.
12296572	eng	The power cable was broken.
12296577	eng	But what are you insinuating?
12296583	eng	Did you see a ghost?
12296588	eng	I'd like my things back.
12296589	eng	I'd love to work here.
12296655	eng	I feel like myself again.
12296719	eng	I feel somewhat relieved now.
12296728	eng	Peel a pear for me.
12296776	eng	Did you worry about me?
12296781	eng	What about Tom fascinates you?
12296889	eng	A string broke on me.
12296894	eng	My hip is killing me.
12296940	eng	Tom will pick us up.
12297019	eng	Have you untangled the rope?
12297021	eng	I'd like to be cremated.
12297023	eng	You should've said that first.
12297139	eng	I'd love to go swimming.
12297142	eng	Our family is falling apart.
12297261	eng	Did you really kiss me?
12297263	eng	The lake was frozen too.
12297297	eng	You should've let us go.
12297302	eng	Our house has a pool.
12297368	eng	Did you take this picture?
12297369	eng	You should've been more alert.
12297372	eng	One candle will be enough.
12297431	eng	Did you two really date?
12297439	eng	Did you have some tea?
12297515	eng	The first mammals laid eggs.
12297547	eng	Our fathers were good friends.
12297553	eng	I feel Tom knows something.
12297558	eng	I would've been really angry.
12297614	eng	Our children are all safe.
12297634	eng	I felt compelled to go.
12297658	eng	I feel nauseous and dizzy.
12297659	eng	I'd love to accompany you.
12297660	eng	Tom will investigate this matter.
12297661	eng	This watch is sterling silver.
12297681	eng	You should've just said that.
12297695	eng	Did you notice the cold?
12297697	eng	Tom must be so happy.
12297700	eng	Has Tom ever tried that?
12297702	eng	Has Tom tried doing that?
12297725	eng	I'd never stoop that low.
12297726	eng	Did you make a fuss?
12297732	eng	It was a head-on collision.
12297747	eng	Our differences make us stronger.
12297748	eng	Our hard work paid off.
12297759	eng	Hang it in the closet.
12297761	eng	Everybody is afraid of you.
12297762	eng	Everybody is scared of you.
12297763	eng	Everyone is scared of you.
12297765	eng	Maybe I should wear gloves.
12297791	eng	You should've turned left there.
12297792	eng	Did you really see Tom?
12297795	eng	Can you lend me that?
12297796	eng	Do you like rabbit meat?
12297846	eng	People started to believe it.
12297851	eng	You should have some soup.
12298017	eng	I'll return on October 20th.
12298019	eng	I had to sit alone.
12298195	eng	Did you witness it happen?
12298203	eng	Have you ordered a drink?
12298307	eng	You'd make an excellent secretary.
12298509	eng	That may already have started.
12298615	eng	Mary is a single woman.
12298618	eng	Do you often travel alone?
12298698	eng	I'd never tell anyone that.
12298782	eng	Did you get a drink?
12298875	eng	Did you get a dog?
12298883	eng	Did you three arrange this?
12298927	eng	I'd like to date you.
12298931	eng	Tom must be behind this.
12298932	eng	That idea is really good.
12298962	eng	I needed Tom for it.
12298981	eng	I'd kill for that job.
12299042	eng	Did you take these photos?
12299116	eng	I'd kill for your legs.
12299134	eng	Cookie has a droopy face.
12299172	eng	I'd like to sketch you.
12299173	eng	Tom will be helping you.
12299209	eng	I'd never say that again.
12299218	eng	You should've opened the box.
12299232	eng	I looked at the brochure.
12299250	eng	Are you living alone here?
12299251	eng	You should've called before coming.
12299254	eng	You should've never said that.
12299256	eng	Sexuality is still a taboo.
12299274	eng	Tom's efforts were in vain.
12299275	eng	You should've come yesterday instead.
12299276	eng	Let's be frank about it.
12299278	eng	You should've let me know.
12299303	eng	You never should've said that.
12299333	eng	I would've pulled the trigger.
12299335	eng	Did you sign your name?
12299336	eng	I knew Tom was away.
12299338	eng	Did you take the elevator?
12299351	eng	This is a lively street.
12299353	eng	We can start straight away.
12299379	eng	I'm glad you didn't quit.
12299383	eng	There were no railway tracks.
12299385	eng	They're always bunking off school.
12299387	eng	They always bunk off school.
12299400	eng	Our master bedroom is upstairs.
12299401	eng	I would've probably gotten killed.
12299402	eng	Tom is in severe danger.
12299403	eng	I'd never leave you alone.
12299407	eng	Are there disabled toilets here?
12299417	eng	The programme is on now.
12299420	eng	The programme is being broadcast.
12299422	eng	Did you get an A?
12299431	eng	I'd just like a job.
12299432	eng	I'll be ready at 2.30.
12299442	eng	The waiter wasn't very polite.
12299443	eng	The service wasn't very polite.
12299444	eng	The waitress wasn't very polite.
12299460	eng	Enter through the narrow gate.
12299472	eng	You mustn't spread these lies.
12299489	eng	Prices have gone up again.
12299498	eng	He was helping his friends.
12299537	eng	Our band is splitting up.
12299540	eng	Did you pull a muscle?
12299592	eng	I would've had a problem.
12299606	eng	A stench filled the room.
12299668	eng	It's an international relations module.
12299682	eng	They're playing on the slide.
12299716	eng	That concept is much fuzzier.
12299777	eng	He did not please him.
12299796	eng	Did you get beaten up?
12299871	eng	Did you get my itinerary?
12299873	eng	Do you know Tom's brothers?
12300018	eng	We were forced to leave.
12300024	eng	I feel fat and ugly.
12300035	eng	I'd like more than that.
12300157	eng	Our fate has been sealed.
12300160	eng	Did you know Tom's wife?
12300161	eng	Our situation is getting better.
12300221	eng	Where can we talk alone?
12300273	eng	I'd never be your friend.
12300274	eng	I got an adrenalin rush.
12300276	eng	Have Tom compile a list.
12300413	eng	Did you get another tattoo?
12300513	eng	Yes or no would suffice.
12300529	eng	Did you order a hamburger?
12300550	eng	You have to have self-confidence.
12300554	eng	I have confidence in myself.
12300559	eng	You have faith in yourself.
12300572	eng	Thanks again for the flowers.
12300718	eng	You should've worn something else.
12300737	eng	You should've taken a cab.
12300739	eng	Did you pick these flowers?
12300740	eng	Tom is strong and athletic.
12300741	eng	Did you try the key?
12300758	eng	You should have that fixed.
12300761	eng	Knowledge is inseparable from conscience.
12300763	eng	Change is inseparable from life.
12300766	eng	Did your shift key break?
12300769	eng	That's a very famous sight.
12300782	eng	Beets have an antimicrobial effect.
12300786	eng	I feel very happy today.
12300789	eng	I'd be happy to volunteer.
12300813	eng	To translate is to deceive.
12300820	eng	Do you know Tom's wife?
12300833	eng	Paramedics are on the scene.
12300835	eng	Our work here is over.
12300837	eng	Our work here is finished.
12300839	eng	Our friends are inside already.
12300854	eng	Have you ever been sledding?
12300856	eng	Do you owe Tom money?
12300941	eng	I heard you were hungry.
12300943	eng	Have you forgotten my warning?
12301050	eng	You should've taken that job.
12301143	eng	I spent the weekend alone.
12301145	eng	Tom will leave you alone.
12301146	eng	I feel very strong today.
12301155	eng	Did you hear a gunshot?
12301160	eng	My physical condition is good.
12301162	eng	I'd love to try that.
12301168	eng	You should've been with me.
12301191	eng	Did you get rained on?
12301192	eng	I feel kind of stupid.
12301216	eng	Did you like the bread?
12301222	eng	Did you have bad luck?
12301266	eng	That shrub has to go.
12301268	eng	He hid behind a bush.
12301276	eng	Do you like this sample?
12301290	eng	Tomato cultivation is very difficult.
12301299	eng	I felt like being alone.
12301300	eng	I feel like we're done.
12301302	eng	Did you hear Tom apologize?
12301352	eng	I would've won the fight.
12301358	eng	I feel a little underdressed.
12301456	eng	Our needs are the same.
12301510	eng	I feel sorry for myself.
12301652	eng	Who's on the guest list?
12301756	eng	Nothing will be built here.
12301770	eng	You should've never stayed here.
12301772	eng	Would you rather go alone?
12301774	eng	Did you just get home?
12301838	eng	I'm almost done with training.
12301877	eng	Our phones are being tapped.
12301880	eng	Our rates are very reasonable.
12301977	eng	Did you tell anybody else?
12301983	eng	Our fathers kept us apart.
12302113	eng	I'd have to say yes.
12302154	eng	This boulevard is very pretty.
12302168	eng	This material has remarkable flexibility!
12302171	eng	I managed to meet him.
12302177	eng	Our parents are still alive.
12302179	eng	Japan is an immense archipelago.
12302186	eng	Did you get any pictures?
12302198	eng	The ice cream has melted.
12302202	eng	You are just like me.
12302204	eng	I still talk to Tom.
12302218	eng	I feel that was good.
12302220	eng	You said we'd be alone.
12302222	eng	This is the garage key.
12302223	eng	The candy store has closed.
12302225	eng	These pants don't have pockets.
12302231	eng	I can handle Tom alone.
12302237	eng	I feel sad right now.
12302240	eng	I felt like coming alone.
12302243	eng	Have you ever dated anyone?
12302245	eng	I came alone and unarmed.
12302283	eng	Have you ever pawned anything?
12302307	eng	I'd planned to come alone.
12302316	eng	I'd never want your job.
12302318	eng	Our mothers are best friends.
12302355	eng	Tom was here last year.
12302357	eng	I felt a bit pressured.
12302390	eng	Did you give Tom money?
12302393	eng	Did you really say no?
12302432	eng	The pool is very deep.
12302471	eng	I feel very comfortable here.
12302472	eng	We only hire the best.
12302480	eng	I felt kind of envious.
12302502	eng	Let's go for a beer!
12302576	eng	I would've paid more attention.
12302580	eng	Did you say Tom lied?
12302586	eng	Our last name is Jackson.
12302798	eng	He daydreamed his whole life.
12302816	eng	I'd never have someone killed.
12302819	eng	There's no reason to laugh.
12302823	eng	Nobody wants to rush you.
12302870	eng	Did you want something specific?
12302876	eng	Have you read the instructions?
12302954	eng	She left you a note.
12302964	eng	Tom pushed the elevator button.
12302968	eng	The future doesn't exist yet.
12302975	eng	She made me some coffee.
12302979	eng	They didn't do the dishes.
12303001	eng	Do you have a grandson?
12303022	eng	Our team is very good.
12303029	eng	You should've been here yesterday.
12303035	eng	Tom fell into a hole.
12303097	eng	I am the youngest child!
12303107	eng	I can guess your thoughts.
12303110	eng	I lost my memory card.
12303121	eng	I feel guilty enough already.
12303238	eng	I'd love to contribute something.
12303247	eng	Did you skip work again?
12303311	eng	You should've had a lawyer.
12303317	eng	I feel stiff all over.
12303350	eng	Were you surprised by this?
12303394	eng	October 20th is my birthday.
12303403	eng	Tom knows all about witches.
12303454	eng	I found that very fake.
12303455	eng	I found that very contrived.
12303457	eng	A sultan had three sons.
12303505	eng	Sorry for keeping you waiting.
12303519	eng	Does counterpropaganda help against propaganda?
12303535	eng	It was cold and cloudy.
12303543	eng	I'd like to close early.
12303544	eng	Did you tell Tom why?
12303546	eng	I've got time to wait.
12303547	eng	I have time to wait.
12303554	eng	I've been patient so far.
12303555	eng	I've been patient until now.
12303557	eng	Did you wake the children?
12303561	eng	Quit dreaming; that won't happen.
12303565	eng	They don't want to go.
12303566	eng	That's just what he knows.
12303568	eng	Do what must be done.
12303583	eng	I'd like to explain myself.
12303586	eng	I feel kind of scared.
12303588	eng	The door won't stay shut.
12303589	eng	The door won't stay closed.
12303595	eng	Tom used to come here.
12303601	eng	Italy isn't an island country.
12303603	eng	Sales have been increasing recently.
12303615	eng	You should have a drink.
12303616	eng	Did you taste this wine?
12303630	eng	I would've given you anything.
12303634	eng	I feel really relaxed now.
12303636	eng	Tom ran into the barn.
12303660	eng	Your door isn't completely shut.
12303704	eng	Where is your younger brother?
12303709	eng	I hope everyone understands that.
12303729	eng	Have you seen those drawings?
12303734	eng	Tom was dressed like John.
12303775	eng	I'd suggest you sign this.
12303778	eng	Our options were extremely limited.
12303779	eng	Have you met Tom's family?
12303781	eng	I would've liked to sing.
12303815	eng	Tom will be a cook.
12303817	eng	I feel someone watching us.
12303983	eng	We're almost ready to begin.
12304097	eng	Were Tom and Mary injured?
12304126	eng	Don't you feel like summer?
12304296	eng	Did you take those pictures?
12304545	eng	You should've let me explain.
12304553	eng	You should've been more patient.
12304698	eng	Did you say run away?
12304710	eng	Are you very hungry now?
12304759	eng	I'm looking at a snake.
12304761	eng	I'm looking at the snake.
12304968	eng	I felt kind of woozy.
12304969	eng	Our planning wasn't very good.
12304971	eng	Did you like Tom's stories?
12304994	eng	I feel like drinking coffee.
12304996	eng	I feel a bit vulnerable.
12305001	eng	I'm proud of my legs.
12305005	eng	I'm a very fast runner.
12305016	eng	Your ideas are really good.
12305019	eng	Did you hear Tom shouting?
12305020	eng	Did you really stab somebody?
12305041	eng	We've changed the schedule slightly.
12305042	eng	Things have gotten really complicated.
12305043	eng	Tom is my baby's daddy.
12305069	eng	Drink a bit of brandy.
12305093	eng	I'd like to explain something.
12305094	eng	You should've dealt with that.
12305096	eng	Did you loan Tom money?
12305099	eng	Our preparations are now complete.
12305181	eng	Have you found a remedy?
12305188	eng	I feel pretty wiped out.
12305189	eng	I'd trust you with anything.
12305191	eng	I feel weak and dizzy.
12305230	eng	I heard mention of that.
12305240	eng	Will we be dining alone?
12305248	eng	People do not know this.
12305249	eng	You should've figured it out.
12305287	eng	You should've come straight home.
12305289	eng	Tom is really overdoing it.
12305290	eng	Did you read your contract?
12305297	eng	Do you like to teach?
12305298	eng	I teach Spanish and English.
12305313	eng	The bathroom is this way.
12305318	eng	I can't stop using Tatoeba.org!
12305329	eng	I don't think you're scientists.
12305335	eng	Are there native Esperanto speakers?
12305338	eng	Stop dreaming; that won't happen.
12305340	eng	He neither entered, nor exited.
12305344	eng	The color doesn't suit me.
12305356	eng	That color doesn't suit me.
12305365	eng	It'll be a sunny day.
12305369	eng	This is a good college.
12305397	eng	"I'm ugly." "No you're not."
12305414	eng	Doesn't it feel like summer?
12305534	eng	Both my hands are burnt.
12305622	eng	Let me do this alone.
12305628	eng	Tom organized a talent show.
12305888	eng	Did you get something nice?
12305898	eng	Did you find another job?
12306181	eng	I feel this is unfair.
12306490	eng	You should've locked the door.
12306742	eng	Did you move my chair?
12306745	eng	Did you know Tom then?
12306753	eng	Do you resent being here?
12306867	eng	Elsewhere the doors are closed.
12306870	eng	Why won't you be quiet?
12306888	eng	Tom needs to be rescued.
12306929	eng	Have you been sued before?
12306930	eng	You should've made the deal.
12307024	eng	I feel like we misunderstood.
12307030	eng	How hungry are you now?
12307041	eng	Did you play outside today?
12307320	eng	We studied together at university.
12307321	eng	They studied together at school.
12307331	eng	Did Tom mention what happened?
12307333	eng	Some people prefer traveling alone.
12307341	eng	Our factory was burnt down.
12307343	eng	Tom had been to Boston.
12307344	eng	That was an adrenaline rush.
12307346	eng	Did you hear a splash?
12307347	eng	I would've appreciated a call.
12307348	eng	Did you have Tom followed?
12307367	eng	Did Tom say anything important?
12307438	eng	This is a one-litre bottle.
12307442	eng	What time shall we meet?
12307443	eng	Did you see my pictures?
12307445	eng	Tom's house is always clean.
12307463	eng	I'd like to sell these.
12307492	eng	He was born in winter.
12307494	eng	Apple trees blossom in spring.
12307503	eng	Have you almost finished here?
12307514	eng	Our experiences make us smart.
12307592	eng	Were you here October 20th?
12307641	eng	They started working here yesterday.
12307664	eng	What is changing in practice?
12307668	eng	Her mom is calling her.
12307730	eng	Did you get locked out?
12307774	eng	I'd like to add something.
12307775	eng	You should've called a policeman.
12307779	eng	I feel warm all over.
12307830	eng	Tom is the gaffer here.
12307840	eng	Pop over to my place.
12307841	eng	Pop over to my gaff.
12307849	eng	Did you water your plants?
12307860	eng	You should've gotten dressed faster.
12307863	eng	You should've stuck with us.
12308158	eng	Nobody saw who brought it.
12308327	eng	Did you sell that boat?
12308347	eng	I saw what Tom drew.
12308589	eng	Did you take any risks?
12308599	eng	Did you get a text?
12308700	eng	Can I copy off you?
12308721	eng	I'm not your errand boy!
12308731	eng	He never complained about anything.
12308891	eng	You should've brought your umbrella.
12308936	eng	Did you steal Tom's things?
12308937	eng	I felt kind of stupid.
12308939	eng	Your place is always clean.
12309007	eng	Our money is running out.
12309029	eng	I wanted an older brother.
12309033	eng	I've slightly rewritten my resume.
12309039	eng	I never walk home alone.
12309040	eng	Did you write this poem?
12309041	eng	Come in and meet Tom.
12309050	eng	I would've died of embarrassment.
12309052	eng	The quarterback spiked the ball.
12309059	eng	Anyway, I decided to go.
12309060	eng	Did you read my report?
12309061	eng	You should've had more confidence.
12309063	eng	Give me your frank opinion.
12309127	eng	Tom got mugged this morning.
12309128	eng	Did you turn it off?
12309131	eng	Who broke that window pane?
12309148	eng	Give us a minute alone.
12309201	eng	He taught me a word.
12309220	eng	We are entering the classroom.
12309231	eng	Will I lose my arm?
12309254	eng	Traveling alone can be boring.
12309259	eng	We will take our share.
12309276	eng	They have chosen his poems.
12309280	eng	I have taken a gun.
12309296	eng	I am upset with them.
12309298	eng	They are upset with us.
12309339	eng	Fuck the World Economic Forum.
12309363	eng	Did you light the fire?
12309500	eng	I'd never tell a soul.
12309504	eng	Tom and Mary are talkative.
12309589	eng	We should never lose hope.
12309591	eng	You should've worn warmer clothes.
12309722	eng	Could you leave me alone?
12309724	eng	Tom is coming this way.
12309883	eng	I'd never get you flowers.
12309888	eng	You should've informed us immediately.
12309971	eng	They did not please them.
12310097	eng	I came to Australia alone.
12310245	eng	Our flight has been announced.
12310248	eng	Did you really design this?
12310253	eng	Did you three get drunk?
12310291	eng	We do not need bloodshed.
12310292	eng	This book relates the stars.
12310395	eng	Over thirty people showed up.
12310525	eng	I felt terrible that day.
12310575	eng	I'd never have shot you.
12310599	eng	I worked on this alone.
12310617	eng	I feel very nervous now.
12310618	eng	Tom desperately needs our help.
12310673	eng	All our mothers are nurses.
12310697	eng	I feel a little tipsy.
12310726	eng	I'd hate to waste that.
12310770	eng	The boy blows soap bubbles.
12310771	eng	You should've informed the police.
12310772	eng	Have you heard from headquarters?
12310810	eng	Tom is quite a baker.
12310813	eng	You should've taken their offer.
12310864	eng	I visited Tom in October.
12310865	eng	Our electricity is still off.
12310894	eng	Stop dreaming. It won't happen.
12310896	eng	Stop dreaming. It's not happening.
12310900	eng	What's your favourite TV series?
12310919	eng	Mathematics is my favourite subject.
12310935	eng	Our moms were friends once.
12310939	eng	Our mums were friends once.
12310940	eng	Your mum's on the phone.
12311067	eng	These fish were caught today.
12311069	eng	Our dog ​​is really clever.

12311077	eng	This is a little vague.
12311079	eng	This is a bit vague.
12311093	eng	Is pasta good for you?
12311230	eng	The flowers cheered him up.
12311266	eng	I know how to live.
12311277	eng	The buildings are on fire.
12311281	eng	If you're buying, I’m drinking.
12311289	eng	May I see it again?
12311290	eng	May I see him again?
12311392	eng	Tom is a crack dealer.
12311526	eng	Our family is very poor.
12311529	eng	You should've accepted my offer.
12311537	eng	I feel out of breath.
12311608	eng	Tom is investigating the case.
12311689	eng	Did you take many pictures?
12311929	eng	This is a nice jacket.
12311938	eng	I felt nauseous and dizzy.
12311942	eng	I feel unusually good today.
12311946	eng	You'd better not go alone.
12311999	eng	I feel ten pounds lighter.
12312024	eng	"I'm going to Ottawa." "Go."
12312029	eng	Tom wanted to drive there.
12312032	eng	Didn't you know Tom drank?
12312033	eng	Didn't you know Tom smoked?
12312043	eng	Tom will definitely be back.
12312045	eng	I'll mow the lawn tomorrow.
12312054	eng	I'd like to compete, too.
12312063	eng	Did you know those gentlemen?
12312080	eng	Open the door a bit.
12312081	eng	Open the door a little.
12312087	eng	Is the zoo open today?
12312094	eng	How can that be achieved?
12312095	eng	How can we achieve that?
12312109	eng	I would've been really worried.
12312146	eng	I'd like to buy one.
12312147	eng	Tom knows nothing about this.
12312149	eng	I would've just stayed home.
12312164	eng	I suspect Tom was hungry.
12312165	eng	Have you seen anything unusual?
12312168	eng	Would you like a pretzel?
12312172	eng	I can walk home alone.
12312186	eng	Have you sold it already?
12312204	eng	I'd like to return home.
12312223	eng	Why are you guys screaming?
12312233	eng	I feel just the same.
12312235	eng	Pack up and leave now.
12312240	eng	I feel a bit sleepy.
12312272	eng	Do you work on Saturday?
12312295	eng	I would've written about it.
12312297	eng	Tom gave us a watermelon.
12312298	eng	I would've waited all night.
12312386	eng	I feel so lonely tonight.
12312390	eng	I should've heeded Tom's warning.
12312395	eng	Did you get some help?
12312478	eng	Our happiness depends on that.
12312481	eng	I'd rather be a farmer.
12312497	eng	Did you teach Tom that?
12312551	eng	I feel kind of nervous.
12312556	eng	Did you try the knob?
12312619	eng	I'm pretty embarrassed about that.
12312680	eng	I'd be happy to assist.
12312684	eng	My parents are happily married.
12312848	eng	Did you major in art?
12312857	eng	First impressions are often wrong.
12312901	eng	What is a prehistoric human?
12312955	eng	You can forget my comment.
12312987	eng	Our lives have become better.
12313030	eng	Tom promised to hire them.
12313033	eng	Tom promised to employ them.

12313150	eng	Tom was doing his job.
12313152	eng	I would've appreciated knowing that.
12313341	eng	I'd like to have kids.
12313520	eng	Our focus is on efficiency.
12313521	eng	Have you ever been tortured?
12313645	eng	Did Tom say anything interesting?
12313647	eng	Suddenly, I feel all alone.
12313727	eng	You should've reported it immediately.
12313729	eng	Tom will try your coffee.
12313801	eng	Our family is very large.
12313832	eng	I don't need any explanation.
12313951	eng	I'd like to go soon.
12314008	eng	Did you make this schedule?
12314009	eng	Tom seems to be joking.
12314010	eng	Did you stay home today?
12314029	eng	I was sick in October.
12314030	eng	Have you met Tom's parents?
12314060	eng	Our efforts are paying off.
12314062	eng	I felt calm and relaxed.
12314088	eng	I'd never have gotten that.
12314089	eng	Did you get lost again?
12314091	eng	Have you made any resolutions?
12314101	eng	You should have some breakfast.
12314104	eng	Have you been drinking wine?
12314107	eng	Our enemies will be destroyed.
12314109	eng	Will you be fine alone?
12314111	eng	Did you read the inscription?
12314128	eng	Pay attention to the details.
12314175	eng	Our family is really close.
12314246	eng	The buses are all full.
12314269	eng	Did you get Tom's address?
12314272	eng	Did you go skateboarding yesterday?
12314290	eng	How do you use chopsticks?
12314331	eng	I'd suggest you go home.
12314333	eng	You should've come right home.
12314384	eng	I felt very lonely there.
12314387	eng	Did you notice Tom's accent?
12314389	eng	I work alone these days.
12314449	eng	Did you pull the trigger?
12314526	eng	I pooped behind the hedge.
12314536	eng	His scythe hit a stone.
12314598	eng	Our detachment suffered a defeat.
12314648	eng	Perseus cut off Medusa's head.
12314649	eng	Our guests have just arrived.
12314655	eng	You can't kick me out.
12314875	eng	Nobody prepared Tom for that.
12315230	eng	You should've joined us earlier.
12315335	eng	She lost his new watch.
12315336	eng	He lost her new watch.
12315367	eng	I wish I lived alone.
12315470	eng	Did you plan for this?
12315574	eng	You owe me a dance.
12315578	eng	I felt a sharp pain.
12315585	eng	You should've sided with Tom.
12315751	eng	Did you return the present?
12315761	eng	Our orders were very clear.
12315791	eng	I'd like a drink, too.
12315793	eng	Did you have lunch today?
12315797	eng	Did you read the indictment?
12315806	eng	Work isn't like school, though.
12315823	eng	Who was with you guys?
12316022	eng	Stop flirting with my sister!
12316026	eng	Flirting with boys is exhausting.
12316047	eng	Are you ready for command?
12316050	eng	German syntax is absolutely rigorous.
12316057	eng	There's meat at the butcher's.
12316063	eng	Caring for plants is calming.
12316082	eng	Cycling is a good sport.
12316096	eng	I was a kid then.
12316097	eng	He doesn't like heat waves.
12316102	eng	They haven't come, have they?
12316103	eng	Your back is completely pale.
12316106	eng	She came with her mother.
12316108	eng	One should tell the truth.
12316223	eng	I felt kind of nervous.
12316226	eng	Did you know Tom's sons?
12316255	eng	The trick is too obvious.
12316266	eng	Did you get to sing?
12316268	eng	I'd rather do this myself.
12316270	eng	I have something to add.
12316276	eng	You should have an assistant.
12316280	eng	Tom doesn't smile very much.
12316281	eng	I'd advise you to cooperate.
12316341	eng	Tom showed us a shortcut.
12316379	eng	Our families are really close.
12316382	eng	Take care of my horse.
12316384	eng	Did you know Tom knew?
12316386	eng	I'd hate to offend someone.
12316406	eng	Do you like watching movies?
12316421	eng	Are you open on Sundays?
12316436	eng	I'd like to hire you.
12316454	eng	Come to the front, please.
12316469	eng	Tom likely won't be there.
12316470	eng	Tom won't likely be there.
12316472	eng	This happened often in winter.
12316473	eng	This often happened in winter.
12316474	eng	Please walk a little slower.
12316475	eng	Let's forget what happened yesterday.
12316477	eng	Why wasn't Tom helping you?
12316483	eng	I'll be back home tomorrow.
12316516	eng	Our plans have been changed.
12316523	eng	Did you take these photographs?
12316604	eng	Our mission has just changed.
12316609	eng	You should've told us everything.
12316611	eng	Tom is there for that.
12316612	eng	You should have some coffee.
12316693	eng	Did you paint all these?
12316694	eng	I'd like to draw you.
12316696	eng	You should've stayed at home.
12316703	eng	His leg's in a cast.
12316796	eng	A diamond is a gem.
12316915	eng	You'd make a great boss.
12316921	eng	I feel that way myself.
12316933	eng	I feel even lonelier now.
12317045	eng	You should've let me answer.
12317052	eng	Today must be October 20th.
12317156	eng	You should've won that game.
12317159	eng	Did you get any help?
12317220	eng	Our job here is done.
12317338	eng	It's a really good sketch.
12317339	eng	It's a really good skit.
12317408	eng	Did you get Tom's permission?
12317539	eng	Did you know Tom long?
12317611	eng	Did you inform the police?
12317677	eng	I feel kind of weird.
12317706	eng	I live alone right now.
12317711	eng	I would've asked for permission.
12317733	eng	You should've brought an umbrella.
12317736	eng	I wanted some alone time.
12317744	eng	Our work is done here.
12317746	eng	No one understands it yet.
12317754	eng	Do you like teaching children?
12317758	eng	It's been almost three years.
12317769	eng	I'm having a tough day.
12317770	eng	I'm having a lousy day.
12317771	eng	I'm having a terrible day.
12317773	eng	The smoke detector went off.
12317775	eng	Do you have colored pencils?
12317789	eng	Is today an unlucky day?
12317791	eng	Our taxes are too high.
12317793	eng	I was alone till yesterday.
12317817	eng	Have you loaded the rifle?
12317822	eng	I'm leaving on October 20th.
12317827	eng	I felt thankful for that.
12317879	eng	Did you like the joke?
12317916	eng	I prefer to practice alone.
12317920	eng	Did you take Tom's things?
12317959	eng	I'm on the waiting list.
12318275	eng	Did you read Tom's note?
12318282	eng	Did you pray for me?
12318386	eng	You were born in October.
12318405	eng	Can I use this cart?
12318425	eng	Tom sings better than you.
12318442	eng	He has not decided yet.
12318503	eng	Life is always too short.
12318562	eng	Did you learn anything today?
12318829	eng	Did you really get angry?
12318839	eng	Tom got himself a job.
12318843	eng	I seldom go fishing alone.
12319008	eng	You should've kept your promise.
12319107	eng	Our marriage is in trouble.
12319109	eng	I'd like to try something.
12319185	eng	He missed him a lot.
12319191	eng	What is the cosmic web?
12319244	eng	My hair started falling out.
12319286	eng	How does the story end?
12319329	eng	The lady was wearing glasses.
12319335	eng	I can't be helped anymore.
12319357	eng	I'd be a terrible mother.
12319363	eng	Did you make any suggestions?
12319365	eng	Please come here right away.
12319390	eng	We have never known love.
12319391	eng	I have never known love.
12319396	eng	She has never known love.
12319399	eng	What is love for you?
12319407	eng	What is love for them?
12319439	eng	I re-read my manuscript again.
12319447	eng	He has never known love.
12319457	eng	He never talks about politics.
12319459	eng	Give us some time alone.
12319461	eng	I feel really safe now.
12319492	eng	Death alone has no remedy.
12319524	eng	Did you sign the forms?
12319550	eng	Do you still feel sick?
12319565	eng	I actually like being alone.
12319567	eng	Did you read the directions?
12319571	eng	Tom will pick up everything.
12319580	eng	You're very smart and clever.
12319594	eng	Did you know Tom's family?
12319599	eng	I thought Tom forgot Mary.
12319601	eng	You should have that checked.
12319604	eng	Tom will want to sing.
12319615	eng	Is life just a battle?
12319621	eng	Tom loves her a lot.
12319625	eng	I would've told you everything.
12319632	eng	Have you taken your medication?
12319633	eng	Our team is the best.
12319637	eng	I felt alone in Boston.
12319640	eng	Why did you eat alone?
12319641	eng	Why were you eating alone?
12319657	eng	Did you know Tom snores?
12319658	eng	I feel more relaxed now.
12319660	eng	You should've realized that earlier.
12319665	eng	You should've opened the door.
12319669	eng	Did you stop for gas?
12319672	eng	Tom used to sit there.
12319673	eng	You should've left that alone.
12319678	eng	Did you read the proposal?
12319683	eng	I feel pretty good today.
12319693	eng	Our neighbors are nice people.
12319696	eng	Good night, ladies and gentlemen.
12319698	eng	Did you know Tom sketches?
12319703	eng	Do you miss your country?
12319705	eng	It's a town in Australia.
12319706	eng	Did you read my letter?
12319707	eng	It's a city in Australia.
12319708	eng	It's a village in Australia.
12319709	eng	The government let it happen.
12319711	eng	We all let it happen.
12319717	eng	Tom still wears a mask.
12319718	eng	I can tell you're hungry.
12319720	eng	I can't even spell it.
12319723	eng	Did you still want something?
12319726	eng	Have you called a plumber?
12319732	eng	I'd advise you to go.
12319740	eng	Tom never made it back.
12319743	eng	Our orders were quite specific.
12319744	eng	Did you know Tom's brothers?
12319747	eng	Have you guys finished talking?
12319749	eng	Please don't worry about it.
12319752	eng	Can I buy just one?
12319762	eng	We will return to reality.
12319773	eng	I love you, my darling.
12319852	eng	Our informant has been killed.
12319855	eng	You should've worn your hat.
12319871	eng	You should've let me sleep.
12319872	eng	Tom will wake up soon.
12319897	eng	Did you have a question?
12319898	eng	You should've made Tom stay.
12319903	eng	Did you get my telegram?
12319906	eng	I was married in October.
12319913	eng	Our jobs are very similar.
12320050	eng	Did you prepare the dinner?
12320055	eng	You should've warned us earlier.
12320056	eng	Did you know Tom's sisters?
12320321	eng	I never could hate you.
12320463	eng	Our rates are very competitive.
12320466	eng	Tom has explained it all.
12320470	eng	I would've given you permission.
12320473	eng	This is a complicated mission.
12320478	eng	Did you like the dinner?
12320562	eng	Accept my heartfelt, humble apology.
12320572	eng	This will soon be over.
12320578	eng	Tom pretended to be mute.
12320611	eng	Tom was killed in prison.
12320612	eng	Tom was stabbed in prison.
12320636	eng	Did Tom really commit suicide?
12320642	eng	I feel really special now.
12320661	eng	Somebody must have done it.
12320721	eng	Will you come here alone?
12320723	eng	Did you make these toys?
12320727	eng	I'd like you to dance.
12320775	eng	I'd like to work here.
12320781	eng	I would've asked some questions.
12320867	eng	I never go shopping alone.
12320933	eng	I wish to dine alone.
12320994	eng	I feel a little jealous.
12321003	eng	You should've dressed more warmly.
12321025	eng	I can't explain that cat.
12321039	eng	Did you like that joke?
12321044	eng	Tom has made a contribution.
12321045	eng	Did you have a reservation?
12321090	eng	That was slick of you.
12321096	eng	Tom sent me a video.
12321155	eng	I feel a bit jealous.
12321160	eng	I saw Tom just now.
12321188	eng	Our wives know each other.
12321192	eng	Meditation helped me a lot.
12321194	eng	Have you checked your voicemail?
12321256	eng	Medication helped me a lot.
12321261	eng	I can't access the database.
12321265	eng	I've got no database access.
12321267	eng	Tom's just a rich kid.
12321276	eng	Our hands are tied now.
12321367	eng	Leave me alone with Tom.
12321401	eng	Wake up! It's beer o'clock!
12321406	eng	Americans are obsessed with guns.
12321423	eng	I'd be a terrible father.
12321428	eng	Did you write down everything?
12321473	eng	He has broken his shinbone.
12321477	eng	I feel there's something wrong.
12321498	eng	I'd rather order a pizza.
12321505	eng	They've let the hostages go.
12321532	eng	How dare you insult Tom!
12321538	eng	I feel comfortable in here.
12321539	eng	Did you save the receipt?
12321540	eng	Tom says he lives alone.
12321584	eng	Did you talk to anyone?
12321586	eng	You should've done so earlier.
12321594	eng	I would've been more patient.
12321605	eng	I'd like my money back.
12321607	eng	Tom died three hours ago.
12321608	eng	All our children are healthy.
12321609	eng	I feel sort of weird.
12321611	eng	Did you remember your medication?
12321615	eng	You should've called me first.
12321637	eng	Do you understand the rules?
12321656	eng	Tom will do the honors.
12321662	eng	You should've stayed home instead.
12321666	eng	I'd probably really like it.
12321668	eng	Our department needs a leader.
12321670	eng	I like being left alone.
12321693	eng	Did you get a prize?
12321707	eng	Did you have any nightmares?
12321708	eng	I leave on October 20th.
12321709	eng	Wait until Tom sees this.
12321710	eng	You should've taken your time.
12321715	eng	Did you recognize that voice?
12321717	eng	Did you really get scared?
12321718	eng	Honk if you see something.
12321721	eng	Tell us about the party.
12321724	eng	Did you try to explain?
12321729	eng	Did you know the victims?
12321777	eng	Our needs are being met.
12321778	eng	Tom helped me get here.
12321785	eng	I have something to barter.
12321788	eng	I feel sort of nervous.
12321794	eng	Tom will listen to me.
12321807	eng	You said Tom was alone.
12321810	eng	Did you skip school today?
12321822	eng	You should've accepted our invitation.
12321823	eng	You should've said so before.
12321824	eng	Did you recognize the shooter?
12321825	eng	You should've cooperated with Tom.
12321828	eng	Did you win the bet?
12321836	eng	I saw you leave alone.
12321839	eng	I'd like to be famous.
12321866	eng	I'd like to be prepared.
12321939	eng	Our last guest is leaving.
12322024	eng	Did you read the sign?
12322025	eng	I'd like to change now.
12322031	eng	I feel perfectly safe here.
12322142	eng	Did you have Tom transferred?
12322279	eng	You should've told me beforehand.
12322302	eng	You should've left without me.
12322424	eng	I think Tom lives alone.
12322427	eng	Our faith will sustain us.
12322644	eng	I forgot you lived alone.
12322761	eng	Our guest list is growing.
12322838	eng	Did you mow the lawn?
12322912	eng	Tom taught us to fight.
12322914	eng	Our families were very close.
12322923	eng	I feel a bit thirsty.
12322964	eng	Many people disagree with me.
12323024	eng	I'd love to kiss you.
12323031	eng	Tom jumped in the water.
12323036	eng	Did you know the attacker?
12323121	eng	I should've left you alone.
12323172	eng	I felt kind of jealous.
12323174	eng	Mary bought the red sash.
12323242	eng	Our meeting was cut short.
12323245	eng	I feel a bit nervous.
12323354	eng	My parents are getting remarried.
12323438	eng	I feel like turning back.
12323443	eng	Have you finished your drawing?
12323460	eng	I'd definitely consider doing that.
12323548	eng	You should've never come back.
12323560	eng	You should've done this beforehand.
12323657	eng	I never got it right.
12323660	eng	I feel this is wrong.
12323787	eng	Did you get hurt again?
12323793	eng	Some of us are injured.
12323802	eng	You should've worn a scarf.
12323857	eng	Did you want to stay?
12323859	eng	We've run out of aspirin.
12323860	eng	I crapped my pants again.
12323862	eng	You should've done it sooner.
12323878	eng	Please come here right now.
12323893	eng	Did you try my suggestion?
12323895	eng	The deadline is October 20th.
12323897	eng	You should've done the same.
12323926	eng	I'd like to have children.
12323934	eng	A crow was cawing loudly.
12323938	eng	I should've married someone else.
12323944	eng	Did you guys call Tom?
12324012	eng	Have you ever tried meditating?
12324119	eng	I'd like to use that.
12324121	eng	Did you not hear Tom?
12324128	eng	Are we really alone here?
12324186	eng	This programme is about penguins.
12324209	eng	I'd really appreciate your support.
12324214	eng	Did you lose any weight?
12324216	eng	I should've left Tom alone.
12324265	eng	Tom has probably never cried.

12770653	eng	You need to know everything.
12770656	eng	We would've been more careful.
12770661	eng	You move with quiet power.
12770664	eng	Just leave it like that.
12770702	eng	She moves with quiet confidence.
12770729	eng	Is peace found in stillness?
12770734	eng	He wolfed down the food.
12770735	eng	He wolfed the food down.

12770923	eng	Why don’t you come along?
12770932	eng	Although tired, they continued on.
12770941	eng	This must be handled carefully.
12770947	eng	Knowing him, he’ll arrive late.
12770952	eng	Couldn’t this wait until tomorrow?
12770956	eng	They waited, but nothing happened.
12770957	eng	Why was it left unsaid?
12770958	eng	While waiting, they grew anxious.
12770961	eng	Would you have acted differently?
12770967	eng	What lies beyond the horizon?
12770968	eng	With time, all wounds heal.
12770969	eng	Why hadn’t anyone noticed before?
12770978	eng	Shouldn’t we ask before proceeding?
12770979	eng	Mary is an eye doctor.
12770982	eng	Such beauty can’t be described.
12770986	eng	Though tired, she kept walking.
12770991	eng	How can we be sure?
12770994	eng	Given the circumstances, it’s understandable.
12770998	eng	Not once did he complain.
12771003	eng	They arrived just in time.
12771013	eng	The task completed, they rested.
12771024	eng	If you insist, I’ll stay.
12771027	eng	It seems we’re too late.
12771029	eng	Despite the odds, they succeeded.
12771031	eng	It's not going to open.
12771034	eng	Though defeated, they stood tall.
12771035	eng	When do the stores open?
12771046	eng	Why hadn’t they acted sooner?
12771064	eng	Why do we never learn?
12771065	eng	Couldn’t we have tried harder?
12771073	eng	How can it be resolved?
12771074	eng	Everything was falling into place.
12771075	eng	Not a soul had noticed.
12771077	eng	Once they arrived, everything changed.
12771082	eng	What lies ahead remains unknown.
12771085	eng	With time, they grew wiser.
12771086	eng	You wouldn’t have believed it.
12771089	eng	The door was slightly open.
12771090	eng	If only it were true.
12771091	eng	Nothing could be more clear.
12771093	eng	Could anyone have predicted this?
12771099	eng	Can I open the curtains?
12771102	eng	Shall we continue or wait?
12771117	eng	Could this be the solution?
12771120	eng	This door just won't open.
12771127	eng	The door just wouldn't open.
12771128	eng	They’ve been gone too long.
12771133	eng	How could we have known?
12771138	eng	Why wasn’t this mentioned before?
12771151	eng	Should they proceed with caution?
12771158	eng	No one seemed to notice.
12771159	eng	Shall we begin at once?
12771160	eng	Nothing else seemed to matter.
12771163	eng	Despite everything, they remained hopeful.
12771167	eng	Everything came crashing down suddenly.
12771169	eng	This door just wouldn't open.
12771170	eng	Did you ever wonder why?
12771174	eng	Couldn’t we have started sooner?
12771175	eng	At last, the truth emerged.
12771178	eng	Why didn’t you explain earlier?
12771186	eng	Would they have stayed longer?
12771192	eng	Why didn’t we act sooner?
12771194	eng	Despite the difficulties, they succeeded.
12771197	eng	Wouldn’t you agree with that?
12771205	eng	He has always loved kids.
12771217	eng	Couldn’t you have asked earlier?
12771222	eng	Everything was on the line.
12771228	eng	He ran inside the house.
12771236	eng	She went to the woods.
12771237	eng	At least now we understand.
12771243	eng	He went into the cabin.
12771246	eng	He didn't see anything inside.
12771253	eng	Could it have been avoided?
12771257	eng	She couldn't find the cabin.
12771268	eng	Nothing prepared them for this.
12771279	eng	She went into the tent.
12771295	eng	He went to the tent.
12771297	eng	She was in the water.
12771314	eng	He didn't answer right away.
12771316	eng	Why hadn’t anyone told them?
12771324	eng	Could you explain it differently?
12771326	eng	Would you mind explaining again?
12771329	eng	Not a single doubt remained.
12771330	eng	Was there any other option?
12771334	eng	Were there any other options?
12771340	eng	Shall we move ahead cautiously?
12771350	eng	Is there something we’re overlooking?
12771352	eng	Couldn’t we have prepared better?
12771357	eng	He ran for the car.
12771360	eng	He sprinted to the car.
12771365	eng	Why hadn’t anyone mentioned this?
12771483	eng	Cut the pepper into strips.
12771852	eng	In particular, the vowels change.
12771878	eng	What have you looked at?

12771893	eng	I collected some data online.
12771900	eng	And what do you think?
12772047	eng	At 0 degrees, ice thaws.
12772067	eng	I just wanted your instruction.
12772113	eng	He participated in the Olympics.
12772250	eng	He's better than anyone else.
12772254	eng	Do I have other options?
12772273	eng	Did you open the door?
12772279	eng	There's a lot of talk.
12772285	eng	That's neither yours nor mine.
12772416	eng	Tom shot and killed him.
12772435	eng	Is there a beginner course?
12772527	eng	Could this have ended differently?
12772530	eng	No one dared to speak.
12772534	eng	Could they have done more?
12772538	eng	Would it make any difference?
12772541	eng	Despite the chaos, they persevered.
12772548	eng	Could we have anticipated this?
12772551	eng	Nothing could stop them now.
12772571	eng	Would you care to explain?
12772576	eng	Could you have done more?
12772581	eng	Despite their efforts, nothing changed.
12772585	eng	Once again, they stood united.
12772593	eng	Should we reconsider the plan?
12772603	eng	Could it have been prevented?
12772620	eng	Everything is clearer in hindsight.
12772621	eng	Shall we proceed as planned?
12772625	eng	If only they had listened.
12772628	eng	Everything hinges on this decision.
12772629	eng	Could you explain what happened?
12772632	eng	No one anticipated such resistance.
12772646	eng	How long did you know?
12772647	eng	Why didn’t anyone act sooner?
12772648	eng	Everything happened faster than expected.
12772655	eng	Could it really be over?
12772656	eng	Where did they disappear to?
12772662	eng	Despite everything, they kept trying.
12772669	eng	Nothing was left to chance.
12772670	eng	Could you have predicted this?
12772678	eng	Was there ever another option?
12772679	eng	If only they had understood.
12772683	eng	Why hadn’t we noticed sooner?
12772690	eng	Not a moment too soon.
12772696	eng	Be sure to listen carefully.
12772698	eng	To run away solves nothing.
12772721	eng	To learn is to grow.
12772728	eng	To dream is to hope.
12772744	eng	May fortune favor the brave.
12772747	eng	Harder than expected, it was.
12772756	eng	Shall we move forward cautiously?
12772757	eng	Better than nothing, I suppose.
12772760	eng	Do not fear the unknown.
12772780	eng	Could this have been foreseen?
12772806	eng	I saw nothing but water.
12773186	eng	Call them when you’ve decided.
12773196	eng	May your journey be peaceful.
12773203	eng	Let’s move ahead with caution.
12773208	eng	Let her choose for herself.
12773217	eng	Not a single doubt remains.
12773219	eng	To fail is to learn.
12773222	eng	Could they have tried harder?
12773227	eng	Shall we take this chance?
12773229	eng	To hesitate is to lose.
12773240	eng	To be wrong is human.
12773241	eng	Why didn’t they listen sooner?
12773253	eng	Shall we meet again tomorrow?
12773295	eng	To win is to persevere.
12773297	eng	Couldn’t it have been avoided?
12773299	eng	Few understood the risks involved.
12773316	eng	Could this really be happening?
12773324	eng	Could we have prevented this?
12773326	eng	Few people saw it coming.
12773332	eng	Shall we begin again tomorrow?
12773342	eng	Shall we discuss this further?
12773351	eng	Shall we try again tomorrow?
12773358	eng	More challenging than anyone anticipated.
12773377	eng	Not once did he hesitate.
12773378	eng	Few understood the real risk.
12773380	eng	Couldn’t they have done more?
12773399	eng	What’s the next step now?
12773411	eng	More complicated than anyone thought.
12773437	eng	What’s stopping you from trying?
12773448	eng	Let’s move ahead without hesitation.
12773511	eng	Let them speak their truth.
12773520	eng	Better safe than sorry, right?
12773550	eng	Could we have foreseen this?
12773659	eng	What’s the reason for waiting?
12773759	eng	Couldn’t we have foreseen this?
12773782	eng	Let’s not delay any further.
12773789	eng	The company is experiencing difficulties.
12773792	eng	The company is losing momentum.

12823714	eng	He works with a chainsaw.
12823722	eng	He started unloading the trunk.
