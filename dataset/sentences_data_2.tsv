2093049	eng	Nobody was expecting that.
2093053	eng	Nobody's killed me yet.
2093054	eng	Nobody's looking for us.
2093214	eng	Ah, this is easy.
2093245	eng	I'm reluctant to leave.
2093256	eng	Gotta go now, bye!
2093260	eng	You ought to know.

2093601	eng	My name is Soundararajan.
2094045	eng	Are you seeing anybody?
2094441	eng	We all stood up.
2094565	eng	You're not my father.

2094641	eng	Every person is unique.
2094642	eng	Every person is special.
2094766	eng	Why's everybody so quiet?

2094842	eng	Everyone should know this.
2094843	eng	Everyone smiled but Tom.
2094845	eng	Everyone stared at Tom.
2094848	eng	Everybody started to leave.
2094849	eng	Everybody thinks I'm dead.
2094853	eng	Everyone worked very hard.
2095427	eng	Are you expecting someone?
2095432	eng	Can somebody help me?

2095478	eng	Someone cut the rope.
2095481	eng	Someone is watching us.
2095485	eng	Somebody made a mistake.
2095486	eng	Somebody's made a mistake.

2095488	eng	Someone opened the window.
2095493	eng	Somebody stole my car.
2095494	eng	Someone stole Tom's guitar.
2095495	eng	Someone took my place.
2095649	eng	That's probably not so.
2095752	eng	In short, try Dict.
2096083	eng	Tom is a millionaire.
2096101	eng	I too like apples.

2107842	eng	Thank you for everything.
2108249	eng	Tom has Windows 7.
2108942	eng	I'll go to London.
2109127	eng	I’d suggest a comma.
2111088	eng	You are so formal.
2113188	eng	Did you kill him?
2114567	eng	We should do better.
2114996	eng	He finally made it.

2136250	eng	It's an Indian dish.
2136404	eng	They want my death.
2136554	eng	Lubomir loves his mom.
2137198	eng	We must pay taxes.

2143364	eng	You are deceiving yourself.
2144021	eng	No one can resist.
2144278	eng	He went on singing.
2144557	eng	And don't tempt me.
2144603	eng	He stood stock still.
2144613	eng	She's one tough cookie.
2144646	eng	Bill, don't go there!
2144647	eng	It is very small.
2145005	eng	The house always wins.
2145008	eng	They got the prize.

2148527	eng	Do you see them?
2148846	eng	It's past your bedtime.
2149075	eng	Put the book there.

2544638	eng	I'm writing another story.
2544663	eng	I'm suddenly very thirsty.
2544682	eng	I'm simply planning ahead.
2544683	eng	I'm simply obeying orders.
2544689	eng	I'm paying for everything.
2544693	eng	I'm only following orders.
2544709	eng	I'm not planning anything.
2544714	eng	I'm not learning anything.
2544726	eng	I'm not exactly surprised.
2544735	eng	I'm never getting married.
2544736	eng	I'm meeting someone later.
2544737	eng	I'm looking for adventure.
2544742	eng	I'm just following orders.
2544747	eng	I'm horrible with animals.
2544753	eng	I'm having problems again.
2544818	eng	I'm a little disappointed.
2544842	eng	I'll never understand you.
2544892	eng	I'll answer that question.
2544895	eng	I'd rather stay anonymous.
2544907	eng	I wouldn't recommend that.
2544929	eng	I withdrew my application.
2544946	eng	I wasn't really listening.
2544947	eng	I wasn't paying attention.
2544950	eng	I wasn't cooking anything.
2544957	eng	I was knocked unconscious.
2544966	eng	I was eventually released.
2544976	eng	I understood it perfectly.
2544977	eng	I understand your reasons.
2544978	eng	I understand your dilemma.
2544980	eng	I underestimated you, Tom.
2545023	eng	Beautiful night, isn't it?
2545034	eng	You've got the advantage.
2545036	eng	You've been holding back.
2545038	eng	You're worrying too much.
2545040	eng	You're tired, aren't you?
2545042	eng	You're not my girlfriend.
2545046	eng	You're joking, of course.
2545047	eng	You're breaking my heart.
2545048	eng	You're a horrible person.
2545050	eng	You'll be very impressed.
2545056	eng	You have thirty messages.
2545067	eng	What are the differences?
2545068	eng	We've wasted enough time.
2545073	eng	We're friends, aren't we?
2545074	eng	We're brother and sister.
2545075	eng	We're all Canadians here.
2545079	eng	We have thirty employees.
2545095	eng	Tom's a fine-looking boy.
2545099	eng	Tom wouldn't hurt anyone.
2545112	eng	Tom went back downstairs.
2545124	eng	Tom vacuumed his bedroom.
2545158	eng	Tom opened his briefcase.
2545164	eng	Tom never gets headaches.
2545170	eng	Tom isn't messing around.
2545205	eng	Tom didn't like homework.
2545208	eng	Tom co-wrote these songs.
2545209	eng	Tom checked Mary's pulse.
2545211	eng	Tom called the neighbors.
2545217	eng	Tom barely speaks French.
2545218	eng	Tom barely said anything.
2545235	eng	This isn't a negotiation.
2545236	eng	This isn't a coincidence.
2545237	eng	Things are different now.
2545238	eng	They're not my prisoners.
2545239	eng	They're not always right.
2545240	eng	They're having a meeting.
2545242	eng	They were somewhere else.
2545244	eng	The restaurant was quiet.
2545246	eng	The Jacksons are waiting.
2545248	eng	That's unusual, isn't it?
2545249	eng	That wasn't the question.
2545250	eng	Nobody does that anymore.
2545253	eng	It's really cold outside.
2545254	eng	It's difficult, isn't it?
2545263	eng	I'm unaccustomed to this.
2545267	eng	I'm trying to compensate.
2545269	eng	I'm Tom's legal guardian.
2545277	eng	I'm surprised you called.
2545284	eng	I'm sure everything's OK.
2545290	eng	I'm staying with friends.
2545298	eng	I'm sorry for everything.
2545305	eng	I'm responsible for this.
2545318	eng	I'm not thinking clearly.
2545324	eng	I'm not signing anything.
2545325	eng	I'm not selling anything.
2545344	eng	I'm not getting involved.
2545345	eng	I'm not gambling anymore.
2545348	eng	I'm not expecting anyone.
2545350	eng	I'm not driving anywhere.
2545374	eng	I'm just getting started.
2545375	eng	I'm just being realistic.
2545425	eng	I'm doing it voluntarily.
2545427	eng	I'm completely blind now.
2545434	eng	I'm almost finished here.
2545444	eng	I'll tell you everything.
2545451	eng	I'll start getting ready.
2545452	eng	I'll show you everything.
2545465	eng	I'll make Tom understand.
2545486	eng	I'll find out eventually.
2545502	eng	I'll be leaving tomorrow.
2545516	eng	I'd recommend doing that.
2545517	eng	I'd really appreciate it.
2545523	eng	I'd forgotten about that.
2545524	eng	I'd appreciate some help.
2545527	eng	I would've done anything.
2545536	eng	I won't answer questions.
2545584	eng	I took Tom's temperature.
2545608	eng	I thought Tom understood.
2545630	eng	Both brothers were there.
2545632	eng	Are you paying attention?
2545634	eng	Answer the question, Tom.
2545636	eng	Your house is beautiful.
2545637	eng	You've worked very hard.
2545641	eng	You've got five minutes.
2545642	eng	You've always helped me.
2545643	eng	You're wrong about this.
2545644	eng	You're working too hard.
2545645	eng	You're the problem, Tom.
2545646	eng	You're right, of course.
2545647	eng	You're right, as always.
2545651	eng	You're not my assistant.
2545652	eng	You're not helping, Tom.
2545655	eng	You're my new assistant.
2545656	eng	You're my kid's teacher.
2545657	eng	You're losing your hair.
2545660	eng	You're a beautiful girl.
2545662	eng	You'd regret doing that.
2545663	eng	You wouldn't believe me.
2545664	eng	You wouldn't believe it.
2545667	eng	You know the difference.
2545672	eng	You have no alternative.
2545673	eng	You have good instincts.
2545674	eng	You don't know anything.
2545681	eng	Where are the prisoners?
2545682	eng	What's your wife's name?
2545683	eng	What's Tom's blood type?
2545684	eng	What was Tom's reaction?
2545685	eng	What time's the meeting?
2545686	eng	Were the windows closed?
2545687	eng	We're your friends, Tom.
2545688	eng	We're worried about you.
2545691	eng	We're having fun, right?
2545693	eng	We have our differences.
2545698	eng	Tom's not very handsome.
2545700	eng	Tom's blinds are closed.
2545705	eng	Tom wouldn't be pleased.
2545707	eng	Tom would've given up.
2545708	eng	Tom won't stop drinking.
2545714	eng	Tom watched from nearby.
2545716	eng	Tom wasn't expecting me.
2545724	eng	Tom uncorked the bottle.
2545734	eng	Tom thanked the manager.
2545735	eng	Tom talked about sports.
2545737	eng	Tom squeezed the sponge.
2545758	eng	Tom ordered large fries.

2545834	eng	They're not the problem.
2545835	eng	They're all watching us.
2545836	eng	They're all watching TV.
2545837	eng	They're a brass quintet.
2545839	eng	They'll be watching you.
2545840	eng	They'll be here tonight.
2545841	eng	They wouldn't follow us.

2545854	eng	That's ironic, isn't it?
2545856	eng	That wasn't the problem.
2545858	eng	That was wonderful, Tom.
2545864	eng	Nobody could believe it.
2545867	eng	It's shocking, isn't it?
2545868	eng	It's pathetic, isn't it?
2545871	eng	I've tried that already.
2545872	eng	I've trained for months.
2545876	eng	I'm unprepared for this.
2545879	eng	I'm trying to apologize.
2545883	eng	I'm tired of pretending.
2545885	eng	I'm taking it seriously.
2545886	eng	I'm sure you're correct.
2545887	eng	I'm sure you'll succeed.
2545888	eng	I'm sure you'll recover.

2545907	eng	I'm standing right here.
2545924	eng	I'm returning your call.
2545925	eng	I'm resigning on Monday.

2545939	eng	I'm not working tonight.
2545942	eng	I'm not swallowing that.
2545945	eng	I'm not suggesting that.

2545967	eng	I'm no longer depressed.
2545968	eng	I'm making some changes.
2545971	eng	I'm looking for answers.
2545972	eng	I'm just planning ahead.
2545973	eng	I'm just obeying orders.
2545974	eng	I'm just not interested.

2546037	eng	I'm afraid you're wrong.
2546038	eng	I'm afraid you're right.
2546039	eng	I'm afraid to interrupt.
2546040	eng	I'll wait right outside.
2546059	eng	I'll need some supplies.
2546063	eng	I'll make a reservation.

2546104	eng	I'll be better tomorrow.
2546108	eng	I'll ask for directions.
2546109	eng	I'd say that's accurate.
2546116	eng	I'd like nothing better.
2546118	eng	I'd heard you'd changed.
2546121	eng	I'd follow Tom anywhere.
2546125	eng	I wouldn't recommend it.
2546126	eng	I wouldn't be surprised.
2546146	eng	I wasn't doing anything.
2546169	eng	I was feeling nostalgic.
2546170	eng	I was completely fooled.

2711989	eng	It's a stupid rule.
2711990	eng	That was so stupid.
2711991	eng	This was so stupid.

2713119	eng	You're usually so optimistic.
2713136	eng	We'll accept your conditions.
2713156	eng	Tom didn't really understand.
2713159	eng	They're talking about sports.
2713171	eng	Is this absolutely necessary?
2713195	eng	What's Tom's brother's name?
2713210	eng	Tom seems surprisingly calm.
2713228	eng	That's not possible anymore.
2713245	eng	Are you absolutely positive?
2713252	eng	You're mistaken about that.

2713334	eng	We're really good friends.
2713337	eng	We'll continue this later.
2713344	eng	Tom seemed really sincere.
2713357	eng	That's no longer possible.
2713358	eng	That wasn't our agreement.
2713361	eng	It's not that interesting.
2713363	eng	It's getting dark outside.
2713381	eng	You're stronger than Tom.
2713390	eng	What's Tom worried about?
2713391	eng	We'll discuss that later.
2713408	eng	Tom is arriving tomorrow.
2713412	eng	This is not satisfactory.
2713414	eng	They're not coming today.
2713415	eng	They're building a house.
2713416	eng	They both started laughing.
2713417	eng	They aren't coming today.
2713419	eng	That's not your decision.
2713420	eng	That's not a coincidence.
2713421	eng	Mary really is beautiful.
2713422	eng	It's still light outside.
2713423	eng	It's not that ridiculous.
2713424	eng	It's not that noticeable.
2713426	eng	It's not our anniversary.
2713433	eng	Is this really necessary?
2713443	eng	You're such a hypocrite.
2713444	eng	You're really very good.
2713446	eng	You're lost, aren't you?
2713449	eng	You're a true gentleman.
2713450	eng	You'll be busy tomorrow.
2713451	eng	You seemed really upset.
2713453	eng	You really are pathetic.
2713455	eng	We're worried about Tom.
2713457	eng	We're moving next month.
2713460	eng	We won't be intimidated.
2713472	eng	Tom is highly qualified.
2713475	eng	They're both very smart.
2713476	eng	There's plenty of water.
2713478	eng	There's no school today.
2713479	eng	That's really good news.
2713480	eng	That's not my signature.
2713481	eng	So what really happened?
2713483	eng	It's still dark outside.
2713484	eng	It's not that difficult.
2713486	eng	I'm taking tomorrow off.
2713488	eng	I'm now learning French.
2713490	eng	I'm free this afternoon.
2713495	eng	Are you having problems?
2713496	eng	Are you absolutely sure?

2713501	eng	You're both very lucky.
2713503	eng	You're a good customer.
2713504	eng	You'll never defeat us.
2713505	eng	You'll never defeat me.
2713506	eng	You'll help, won't you?
2713510	eng	You seem to understand.
2713516	eng	You guys are hilarious.
2713517	eng	You forgot my birthday.
2713518	eng	What's Tom's wife like?
2713520	eng	What's Tom angry about?
2713522	eng	We're all in agreement.
2713524	eng	We'll be together soon.
2713525	eng	We'll be there shortly.
2713526	eng	We never really talked.
2713537	eng	Tom is really gullible.
2713539	eng	Tom crossed the bridge.
2713543	eng	They won't believe you.
2713545	eng	There's plenty of food.
2713546	eng	There's a page missing.
2713547	eng	That's not my decision.
2713549	eng	It's pretty warm today.
2713550	eng	It's pretty cold today.
2713552	eng	It's a serious problem.
2713554	eng	It doesn't matter, Tom.
2713560	eng	I'll help Tom tomorrow.
2713563	eng	Do you need assistance?
2713566	eng	You'll be better soon.

2713576	eng	We're better than you.
2713577	eng	We're a perfect match.
2713580	eng	We never actually met.
2713581	eng	Tom must be desperate.
2713586	eng	Tom belongs in prison.
2713588	eng	This is not necessary.
2713594	eng	That's not my opinion.
2713597	eng	Let's sing some songs.
2713598	eng	It's quite warm today.
2713599	eng	It's not that strange.
2713601	eng	It's not an emergency.
2713606	eng	I'm afraid it'll rain.
2713607	eng	I'll pay you tomorrow.
2713608	eng	I'll be here tomorrow.
2713609	eng	I'll ask Tom tomorrow.
2713610	eng	I can't come tomorrow.
2713612	eng	You're such an idiot.

2713616	eng	You guys are amazing.
2713617	eng	You forgot your coat.
2713619	eng	What's this used for?
2713620	eng	What's the next stop?
2713622	eng	We really missed you.
2713625	eng	Tom really needs you.
2713628	eng	Tom climbed the tree.
2713629	eng	This is really great.
2713630	eng	They're the same age.
2713632	eng	They'll be here soon.
2713633	eng	There's no salt left.
2713634	eng	There's no milk left.
2713635	eng	There's no food left.
2713636	eng	It's under the chair.
2713638	eng	It's not my decision.
2713639	eng	It's not my birthday.
2713640	eng	It's me that's wrong.
2713641	eng	It isn't raining now.
2713643	eng	I'm shorter than you.
2713645	eng	I'm not coming today.
2713648	eng	I'll miss this place.

2713667	eng	What's this made of?
2713668	eng	What's it all about?
2713670	eng	We're out of danger.
2713673	eng	Tom is between jobs.
2713675	eng	That's not your job.
2713676	eng	It's wrong to steal.
2713677	eng	It's very cold here.
2713680	eng	It's not my concern.
2713681	eng	It's not cold today.
2713682	eng	It's in the kitchen.
2713683	eng	I'm willing to help.
2713684	eng	I'm taller than Tom.

2713720	eng	Tom is drunk again.
2713722	eng	It's under the bed.
2713723	eng	It's not that nice.
2713724	eng	I'm a teacher, too.

2715898	eng	What did he reply?
2715899	eng	What did she reply?
2715964	eng	Say it again, please.

2891495	eng	It made Tom bitter.
2891496	eng	It made Tom happy.
2891497	eng	It made Tom sad.

2891621	eng	It's not so unusual.
2891623	eng	It's not there anymore.
2891624	eng	It's not there now.
2891628	eng	It's one of mine.
2891633	eng	It's somebody else's turn.

2891712	eng	Maybe we can help.
2891714	eng	Maybe we'll get lucky.
2891715	eng	Maybe you can help.
2891718	eng	Move over, will you?
2891719	eng	My car's out back.

2929432	eng	Everyone has been there.
2929784	eng	I am your twin.
2929975	eng	We have two sons.
2930064	eng	Lies beget more lies.
2930065	eng	Does Tom understand French?
2930078	eng	Tom kept his cool.
2930559	eng	Come a little closer.
2930575	eng	You have been playing.
2930576	eng	You had been playing.
2930601	eng	Fear your own shadow.
2930608	eng	I like them both.
2930609	eng	His behaviour was bad.
2930612	eng	We held a seminar.
2930730	eng	You should stop playing.
2930738	eng	Nothing justifies their existence.
2930946	eng	Do you even lift?
2930999	eng	We welcomed their decision.
2931495	eng	He is not home.
2931520	eng	I have two flowers.
2931683	eng	You liked that game.
2931728	eng	She'll like this game.
2931742	eng	Tom suddenly stopped talking.
2931754	eng	It verges on scorn.
2931759	eng	Mary wanted to write.
2931760	eng	Mary wanted to pee.
2931784	eng	I don't like snow.
2931806	eng	Not everybody is poor.
2931852	eng	Tom's socks don't match.
2931902	eng	What're you planning now?
2932709	eng	Emet dislikes that woman.
2934261	eng	Time is up now.
2934272	eng	You're much spoken about.
2934274	eng	I love my father.
2934275	eng	This coat suits him.
2934630	eng	It's curtains for me!
2934632	eng	I lost the desire.
2934654	eng	It seems pretty easy.
2934884	eng	He is an acrobat.
2934896	eng	He was visibly bothered.
2935169	eng	Whose things are those?
2936401	eng	This is an error.
2936414	eng	My cake didn't rise.
2936457	eng	I need a cigarette.
2936477	eng	I don't need favors.
2937190	eng	That's a severe disease.
2937220	eng	His character evened out.
2937222	eng	The plane evened out.
2937248	eng	A groan escaped him.
2937602	eng	Estrogen is a hormone.
2938563	eng	I haven't read it.
2938961	eng	Jesus was a capitalist.

2940690	eng	They used that table.
2940713	eng	This is not salt.
2940737	eng	Tom scored a goal!
2940746	eng	I don't have books.
2940755	eng	Don't forget your coat!
2940763	eng	The descent is dangerous.
2940765	eng	He has curly hair.
2940766	eng	He often plays piano.
2940767	eng	The horse is thirsty.
2940770	eng	My uncle plays guitar.
2940774	eng	Tom folded his sheets.
2941341	eng	They won't find her.
2941342	eng	They won't find it.
2941420	eng	Who sent you here?
2941421	eng	What an amazing goal!
2941438	eng	I'll have my revenge.
2941448	eng	She's in her room.
2941450	eng	When will we meet?
2941608	eng	So she isn't new.
2941991	eng	Did he sleep well?
2942442	eng	Are you now married?
2942451	eng	Congratulations! You're a clown.
2942452	eng	Be a good listener!
2942487	eng	Her penmanship is horrible.
2942501	eng	Mayuko went right home.
2942708	eng	Are you shitting me?
2942726	eng	His penmanship is horrible.
2943141	eng	Please keep me updated.
2943364	eng	We should change something.

2944099	eng	She seemed very nice.
2944100	eng	He seemed very nice.
2944128	eng	Let's change the topic.

2945561	eng	I need a distraction.
2945992	eng	They'll be like "ahaa!"
2946047	eng	Can you follow me?
2946217	eng	Vivisection is a shame.
2946233	eng	And where is that?
2946265	eng	I hate Justin Bieber.
2946395	eng	Don't be so glum.

2946714	eng	It's not Christmas today.
2946723	eng	She ardently loves him.
2946733	eng	Today isn't my birthday.
2946782	eng	It's been raining hard.

2947853	eng	Tom died of hypothermia.
2947856	eng	He's industrious and hard-working.
2947883	eng	These are the girls!
2947886	eng	We trusted each other.
2947915	eng	Your mother eats shit.
2948028	eng	He underwent brain surgery.

2948166	eng	She probably likes you.
2948167	eng	Don't read my diary!
2948168	eng	Don't read my journal!
2948180	eng	He's used to traveling.
2948181	eng	My mind was racing.
2948183	eng	Tom became a Republican.
2948229	eng	What is this abomination?

2949246	eng	Wasn't he your friend?
2949275	eng	The roses smell nice.
2949276	eng	The roses smell good.
2949910	eng	You're acting very strangely.
2949913	eng	I'm not defending him!
2949920	eng	I admire your tenacity.
2949922	eng	He's tall and thin.
2949949	eng	They are not sisters.
2949962	eng	We talked about boys.
2949984	eng	Hold your head high.
2950087	eng	Finally the snow melted.
2950098	eng	When does 2013 end?
2950164	eng	Alas, I was inattentive.

2950728	eng	Tom is Mary's chauffeur.
2950761	eng	Are you in London?
2951124	eng	We often skip school.
2951342	eng	His popularity is waning.
2951364	eng	Stand in the corner!
2951523	eng	Are you hiding something?
2951525	eng	Are you in Boston?
2951529	eng	Are you kids hungry?
2951572	eng	Can we meet somewhere?
2951577	eng	Can you protect me?
2951578	eng	Can you prove that?
2951590	eng	Can't we just leave?
2951594	eng	Come into my office.
2951596	eng	Come outside with me.
2951600	eng	Could you just hurry?
2951608	eng	Did that just happen?
2951609	eng	Did that really happen?
2951614	eng	Did Tom swim yesterday?
2951629	eng	Did you make this?
2951634	eng	Do you have identification?
2951644	eng	Do you believe Tom?
2951647	eng	Do you feel better?
2951758	eng	Do you recognize these?
2951760	eng	Do you recognize this?
2951813	eng	Does Tom swim often?
2951815	eng	Don't stay too late.
2951816	eng	Don't stay too long.
2951822	eng	Eat whatever you want.
2951841	eng	Everyone but Tom swam.
2951845	eng	Everything is just beginning.
2951864	eng	Go do your homework.

2951871	eng	Have you been studying?
2951875	eng	Hey, who are you?
2951882	eng	How did everyone react?
2952102	eng	I hardly ever swim.
2952352	eng	I must've overlooked something.
2952353	eng	I must've been drugged.
2952617	eng	I was terribly worried.
2952729	eng	I'll do something else.
2952731	eng	I'll explain it later.
2952732	eng	I'll go straight home.
2952745	eng	I'll teach you French.
2952751	eng	I'm all worn out.
2952786	eng	I'm just not hungry.
2952801	eng	I'm not hungry yet.
2952843	eng	I'm not tired yet.
2953023	eng	Is Tom learning French?
2953025	eng	Is Tom still eating?
2953026	eng	Is Tom still happy?
2953027	eng	Is Tom still hungry?
2953030	eng	Is Tom still swimming?
2953043	eng	It just got weirder.
2953045	eng	It just isn't fair.
2953047	eng	It just made sense.
2953048	eng	It just takes practice.
2953049	eng	It just wasn't appropriate.
2953050	eng	It just wasn't enough.
2953075	eng	It was just water.
2953079	eng	It wasn't just luck.
2953080	eng	It wasn't just me.
2953081	eng	It wasn't just that.
2953101	eng	It's just a baby.
2953102	eng	It's just a beer.
2953103	eng	It's just a cat.
2953104	eng	It's just a cut.
2953105	eng	It's just a fad.
2953106	eng	It's just a feeling.
2953107	eng	It's just a guess.
2953108	eng	It's just a headache.
2953109	eng	It's just a hobby.
2953111	eng	It's just a precaution.
2953113	eng	It's just a suggestion.
2953114	eng	It's just an idea.
2953115	eng	It's just been awful.
2953118	eng	It's just my luggage.
2953119	eng	It's just not enough.
2953122	eng	It's just not possible.
2953124	eng	It's just not right.
2953126	eng	It's just not safe.
2953130	eng	It's just so creepy.
2953131	eng	It's just so early.
2953132	eng	It's just so exciting.
2953134	eng	It's just so frustrating.
2953135	eng	It's just so hard.
2953136	eng	It's just so pretty.
2953137	eng	It's just so sad.
2953138	eng	It's just so unexpected.
2953139	eng	It's just that simple.
2953140	eng	It's just up ahead.
2953141	eng	It's just what happens.
2953167	eng	Let's all go together.
2953170	eng	Let's explore the possibilities.
2953175	eng	Let's go somewhere nice.
2953183	eng	Let's schedule a meeting.
2953228	eng	Mine is totally different.
2953246	eng	Now just do it.
2953257	eng	Please just get here.
2953258	eng	Please just take it.
2953288	eng	Something's definitely out there.
2953291	eng	Stay out of here.
2953293	eng	Step into my office.
2953297	eng	Stop being so stubborn.
2953299	eng	Swimming isn't allowed here.
2953319	eng	That was just wonderful.
2953321	eng	That's a possible explanation.
2953326	eng	That's just a rumor.
2953327	eng	That's just as bad.
2953328	eng	That's just not acceptable.
2953329	eng	That's just not right.
2953330	eng	That's just so sad.
2953331	eng	That's just the point.
2953341	eng	The delay was unavoidable.
2953495	eng	I am so blessed!
2953535	eng	We all have responsibilities.
2953543	eng	We appreciate the advice.

2953554	eng	We both do that.
2953562	eng	We can be there.
2953565	eng	We can do anything.
2953566	eng	We can do better.
2953570	eng	We can do nothing.
2953579	eng	We can go together.
2953581	eng	We can protect you.
2953582	eng	We can survive anything.
2953583	eng	We can't afford this.
2953590	eng	We could do that.
2953591	eng	We could do this.
2953592	eng	We could do worse.
2953597	eng	We could sing together.
2953604	eng	We do need you.
2953605	eng	We do our best.
2953609	eng	We dodged a bullet.
2953640	eng	We have different goals.
2953641	eng	We have different opinions.
2953642	eng	We have different strengths.
2953643	eng	We have different views.
2953677	eng	We hope you'll cooperate.
2953686	eng	We leave tomorrow morning.
2953691	eng	We might regret this.
2953698	eng	We must destroy it.
2953705	eng	We must go back.
2953706	eng	We must go now.
2953708	eng	We must remain here.
2953712	eng	We must warn Tom.
2953714	eng	We need accurate information.
2953717	eng	We need emergency assistance.
2953718	eng	We need medical supplies.
2953736	eng	We never do that.
2953749	eng	We owe you nothing.
2953751	eng	We owed him that.
2953756	eng	We really appreciate it.
2953761	eng	We rented a movie.
2953762	eng	We returned the money.
2953768	eng	We should ask Tom.
2953770	eng	We should be friends.
2953771	eng	We should be helping.
2953773	eng	We should be partners.
2953776	eng	We should be there.
2953778	eng	We should be together.
2953780	eng	We should both go.
2953781	eng	We should discuss that.
2953783	eng	We should do it.
2953793	eng	We should hire Tom.
2953798	eng	We should probably go.
2953799	eng	We shouldn't be here.
2953817	eng	We were just leaving.
2953818	eng	We were like brothers.
2953828	eng	We'd better do something.
2953829	eng	We'd better humor Tom.
2953834	eng	We'll all go together.
2953843	eng	We'll do better tomorrow.
2953844	eng	We'll do it ourselves.
2953847	eng	We'll do the rest.
2953848	eng	We'll do this later.
2953849	eng	We'll do this together.
2953853	eng	We'll go this afternoon.
2953854	eng	We'll go with you.
2953862	eng	We'll just go now.
2953864	eng	We'll pray for you.

2953888	eng	We're all adults here.
2953891	eng	We're all prisoners here.
2953892	eng	We're all pros here.
2953899	eng	We're aware of that.
2953903	eng	We're behind schedule now.
2953904	eng	We're both reasonable people.
2953905	eng	We're celebrating Tom's birthday.
2953906	eng	We're competitors, not partners.
2953918	eng	We're just finishing up.
2953928	eng	We're not entirely sure.
2953936	eng	We're proceeding on schedule.
2953937	eng	We're proud of you.
2953940	eng	We're really understaffed tonight.
2953946	eng	We're surrounded by police.
2953948	eng	We're wasting our time.
2953949	eng	We're wasting precious time.
2953952	eng	We've allowed for that.
2953958	eng	We've dodged another bullet.
2953968	eng	We've isolated the problem.
2954106	eng	Wait just a minute.
2954107	eng	Wait just a second.
2954150	eng	What should we do?
2954153	eng	What was Boston like?
2954162	eng	What're you two doing?
2954166	eng	What's this book about?
2954177	eng	When did you graduate?
2954192	eng	Who's Tom arguing with?
2954194	eng	Who's your guidance counselor?
2954195	eng	Who's your primary physician?
2954221	eng	Why not just quit?
2954222	eng	Why not just stay?
2954229	eng	Would you just listen?
2954242	eng	I'm not a fangirl.
2954273	eng	I'm not a fanboy.
2954410	eng	You can go back.
2954411	eng	You can go first.
2954426	eng	You can never tell.
2954427	eng	You can never win.
2954431	eng	You can start anytime.
2954433	eng	You can trust me.
2954434	eng	You can trust Tom.
2954435	eng	You can trust us.
2954443	eng	You certainly fooled me.
2954444	eng	You certainly fooled Tom.
2954446	eng	You completely manipulated Tom.
2954449	eng	You could do that.
2954450	eng	You could do this.
2954452	eng	You could go home.
2954458	eng	You could've warned me.
2954459	eng	You danced wonderfully tonight.
2954463	eng	You deserve the best.
2954473	eng	You do seem different.
2954531	eng	You have betrayed us.
2954532	eng	You've exceeded your authority.
2954533	eng	You have gorgeous eyes.
2954564	eng	You insult my intelligence.

3347156	eng	You look rather tired.
3347157	eng	You look pretty tired.
3347158	eng	You sure sound upset.
3347199	eng	Tom called me stupid.
3347292	eng	Tom's goal was disallowed.
3347317	eng	Tom sang off key.

3347363	eng	You're trying too hard.

3348141	eng	Take the room's measurements.
3348162	eng	She let herself go.
3348171	eng	We can't start today.

3350120	eng	I've been pretty busy.
3350152	eng	Could you explain that?
3350176	eng	I'm busy with homework.
3350177	eng	You'd better leave it.
3350182	eng	I know her sister.
3350254	eng	Do you speak Inuktitut?
3350504	eng	We eat at home.
3350506	eng	Where do you study?

3354912	eng	You're home pretty early.
3354913	eng	You're good, aren't you?
3354918	eng	You're being very unfair.
3354946	eng	You shouldn't have run.
3354947	eng	You shouldn't feel bad.
3354948	eng	You shouldn't do drugs.
3354949	eng	You should've taken it.
3354951	eng	You should've done it.
3354952	eng	You should've called Tom.
3354958	eng	You should play football.
3355234	eng	Please take us there.
3355253	eng	She's a real witch!
3355353	eng	You'd better get started.

3356340	eng	You shouldn't go outside.
3356347	eng	You're in trouble now.
3356348	eng	You shouldn't be nervous.
3356366	eng	You should've woken me.
3356370	eng	You're not even listening.
3356378	eng	You shouldn't be jealous.
3356403	eng	You guys aren't helping.
3356411	eng	You should get going.
3356416	eng	You look awfully familiar.
3356419	eng	You think of everything.
3356420	eng	You'll find someone else.
3356421	eng	You'll meet someone else.
3356427	eng	You know I'm different.

3358406	eng	You could've walked away.
3358407	eng	You could've run away.
3358408	eng	You could've just called.
3358410	eng	You could've come over.

3358891	eng	You're scared, aren't you?
3358897	eng	You can't possibly win.
3358907	eng	You should've kissed Tom.
3358916	eng	You shouldn't forget that.
3358922	eng	You look different somehow.
3358927	eng	You'll be held responsible.
3358928	eng	You're far too pessimistic.
3358930	eng	You're just being paranoid.
3358933	eng	You're not being objective.
3358942	eng	You'd better get moving.
3358949	eng	You haven't been listening.
3359714	eng	Leave everything to me.
3359725	eng	We're almost halfway done.

3374672	eng	I've dreamed about this.
3374673	eng	I've dreamed of this.
3374677	eng	It's all right there.
3374678	eng	I couldn't stop them.
3374684	eng	No one's denying that.
3374687	eng	I believe all that.
3374688	eng	I'm sorry for that.
3374689	eng	We both know that.
3374691	eng	I have a surprise.
3374692	eng	I'm still not sure.
3374694	eng	What's your name, son?
3374695	eng	I have a solution.
3374700	eng	You need to shave.
3374704	eng	That's all we saw.
3374706	eng	I've heard the rumor.
3374707	eng	I'm doing all right.
3374709	eng	We're more than ready.
3374710	eng	I'm not a politician.
3374711	eng	They rejected your plan.
3374714	eng	Put some music on.
3374716	eng	That's my final offer.
3374717	eng	Where's the money now?
3374718	eng	I'm not quitting now.
3374719	eng	I'm doing this now.
3374720	eng	I've worked all night.
3374723	eng	They cost too much.
3374724	eng	Listen to your mother.
3374725	eng	Clean up that mess.
3374726	eng	That's what scared me.
3374728	eng	You're just like me.
3374729	eng	That does worry me.
3374732	eng	I'm no longer married.
3374733	eng	I'm a lucky man.
3374735	eng	You're going to lose.
3374740	eng	Now it's too late.
3374741	eng	Now we'll never know.
3374743	eng	I lost my job.
3374749	eng	I'm still doing it.
3374750	eng	Whose fault was it?
3374751	eng	Be quick about it.
3374755	eng	My father is here.
3374756	eng	How does that help?
3374757	eng	I'm going to help.
3374759	eng	How are your grades?
3374760	eng	It tasted really good.
3374761	eng	It was pretty good.
3374762	eng	Why is that good?
3374764	eng	I tried to forget.
3374766	eng	It's partly your fault.
3374767	eng	It's partly my fault.
3374768	eng	We'd better be fast.
3374769	eng	I got all excited.
3374771	eng	It's still very early.
3374772	eng	I was not drinking.
3374773	eng	Put your arm down.
3374775	eng	That's how it's done.
3374776	eng	That's what I'm doing.
3374780	eng	That could take days.
3374781	eng	People say I'm crazy.
3374782	eng	Tom thinks I'm crazy.
3374783	eng	I'm still not certain.
3374785	eng	I was kidding before.
3374787	eng	Why would that be?
3374790	eng	Maybe you should ask.
3374791	eng	Take a look around.
3374792	eng	Put on your apron.
3374793	eng	I'm very, very angry.
3374795	eng	It was no accident.
3375119	eng	Tom has mental problems.
3375354	eng	She's richer than pretty.
3375586	eng	Let's drink this beer.
3375639	eng	Is the festival free?
3375645	eng	The festival is free.
3375754	eng	What's that over there?
3375762	eng	You broke your promise.
3375763	eng	That's the whole point.
3375766	eng	Where is everybody now?
3375768	eng	What changed your mind?
3375775	eng	You're running a fever.
3375777	eng	That man looks familiar.
3375779	eng	That's just not enough.
3375784	eng	I admire your ambition.
3376067	eng	Tom's remark was insensitive.
3377076	eng	I'm scared of you.
3377082	eng	That really went well.
3377083	eng	They're heading this way.
3377089	eng	We'll always be together.
3377109	eng	Stop worrying about that.
3377121	eng	I got straight A's.
3377128	eng	It's a great opportunity.
3377131	eng	I'm quite satisfied now.
3377135	eng	You completely ignored me.
3377149	eng	I'm not easily impressed.
3377150	eng	This is really important.
3377168	eng	When was this decided?
3377178	eng	That's just the beginning.
3377183	eng	Let's start over again.
3377912	eng	This is Chinese food.
3377930	eng	Please give me money.
3377993	eng	Did you ski yesterday?

3378026	eng	I often drink tea.
3378042	eng	My surname is Ling.
3378083	eng	I'm flying to Italy.

3378098	eng	I go to university.
3378100	eng	I sell two flowers.
3378112	eng	We are in school.
3378116	eng	We are in Finland.
3378128	eng	I am also here.
3378130	eng	I drink tea, too.
3378134	eng	I am not happy.

3378516	eng	French cuisine is excellent.
3378682	eng	I yelled for help.
3378688	eng	This is standard procedure.
3378930	eng	Children often make mistakes.
3378937	eng	Whose fault is that?
3378943	eng	Who's responsible for these?
3378944	eng	Who's responsible for this?
3378978	eng	I saw Marcus's house.
3379150	eng	I just saw her.
3379282	eng	I need to pee.
3380361	eng	Use it with caution.
3380542	eng	I came from Switzerland.
3380543	eng	I came from Iran.
3380682	eng	What are their rights?
3381209	eng	Tom is no genius.
3382057	eng	Oh God, help me!
3382661	eng	That looks pretty cool.
3382662	eng	That's so not cool.
3382678	eng	We could get caught.
3382700	eng	This is just amazing.
3382716	eng	I touched the bottom.
3382739	eng	He's dumb and immature.
3382762	eng	We should go together.
3382814	eng	Sorry, but Tom's right.
3382815	eng	Sorry, but Mary's right.
3382875	eng	I'm not easily offended.
3382877	eng	It would be awesome!
3382993	eng	This is not war.
3383583	eng	You CAN do it.
3383592	eng	You MAY do it.
3383952	eng	This will kill that.
3383977	eng	This one is free.
3383980	eng	Smoking shortens your life.
3383984	eng	I hate horror films.
3384252	eng	I'm on the pill.
3384263	eng	I love your country.
3384589	eng	They rejected my proposal.
3384594	eng	Did you call 911?
3384637	eng	What a stupid guy!
3384864	eng	You're better than Tom.
3384885	eng	What's Tom's favorite food?
3385039	eng	You haven't even tried.
3385089	eng	Mary is extremely beautiful.

3385821	eng	What rhymes with Tatoeba?
3385838	eng	Tom is very energetic.
3385941	eng	I'm probably just paranoid.
3385959	eng	Is this an invitation?
3385960	eng	Is this a date?
3385962	eng	Was that an insult?
3385963	eng	Was that a squirrel?
3386008	eng	I was just day-dreaming.
3386877	eng	She's a living encyclopaedia.
3386890	eng	It's our only hope.
3386892	eng	It could get messy.
3386894	eng	It's a risky plan.
3386895	eng	It could be risky.
3386896	eng	It might be risky.
3386897	eng	Did you draw that?
3387026	eng	Did you wash that?
3387136	eng	Faith will move mountains.
3387138	eng	Fight fire with fire.
3387141	eng	Garbage in, garbage out.
3387151	eng	Never judge from appearances.
3387162	eng	Time cures all things.
3387675	eng	It's my only hope.
3388085	eng	The air was humid.
3389084	eng	No one understands you.
3389607	eng	She likes jelly donuts.
3390180	eng	Quitting smoking is hard.
3390181	eng	Quitting smoking is difficult.
3390587	eng	We're back online now.
3390598	eng	You're dying, aren't you?
3390601	eng	Your guests are waiting.
3390616	eng	You haven't changed much.
3390627	eng	You're doing really great.
3390632	eng	You shouldn't be driving.
3390634	eng	You're my favorite babysitter.
3390666	eng	Get off my property.
3390674	eng	I love surprise parties.
3390720	eng	I'm not a gambler.
3390721	eng	It's your own fault.
3390803	eng	Can I touch you?
3391085	eng	What is a computer?
3391088	eng	What is a calculator?
3391091	eng	What is a fax?

3391531	eng	You know many things.
3391892	eng	Tom is a biochemist.
3391915	eng	Human life is sacred.
3392242	eng	This is so retarded.
3392556	eng	Let's watch the game.
3392571	eng	Let's take turns driving.
3392573	eng	Let's stop playing games.
3392574	eng	Let's stop doing this.
3392575	eng	Let's start with you.

3392699	eng	Let's all settle down.
3392905	eng	Do as I ask.
3392909	eng	It sure is hot.
3392911	eng	It sure is cold.
3392912	eng	Why would I mind?
3392913	eng	Why would I care?
3392914	eng	Why should I lie?
3392916	eng	What can I bring?
3392917	eng	What a neat idea!
3392925	eng	Wait till I call.
3392926	eng	This is too much.
3392927	eng	This is too hard.
3392928	eng	The rest is here.
3392929	eng	The power is out.
3392930	eng	The play is over.
3392931	eng	The light was on.
3392932	eng	The light is off.
3392933	eng	The door is ajar.
3392934	eng	That made me mad.

3392973	eng	Did you pass out?
3392974	eng	Would you help me?
3392976	eng	What would I wear?
3392977	eng	Was that too much?
3392978	eng	Was that too easy?
3392979	eng	Wait for me there.
3392980	eng	This could be fun.
3392982	eng	The room was bare.
3392983	eng	The room was cold.
3392984	eng	That was too easy.
3392985	eng	That might be fun.
3392986	eng	That could be fun.
3392987	eng	Take care of this.
3392988	eng	Should I call Tom?
3392989	eng	Please let me out.
3392990	eng	Let me carry that.
3392991	eng	Keep your coat on.
3392993	eng	Just wait and see.

3392996	eng	It was no trouble.
3392997	eng	It should be fine.
3392998	eng	It might not work.
3392999	eng	Is your wife home?

3393144	eng	What came over you?
3393145	eng	Does it upset you?
3393146	eng	How drunk are you?
3393147	eng	Are they ready yet?
3393148	eng	Isn't Tom home yet?
3393150	eng	Does that mean yes?
3393151	eng	Are you ever wrong?
3393153	eng	This is very wrong.
3393154	eng	Do I look worried?
3393155	eng	Does it still work?
3393156	eng	It just might work.
3393157	eng	It might even work.
3393158	eng	It might just work.
3393159	eng	Go around that way.
3393161	eng	Come party with us.

3393173	eng	Just listen to Tom.
3393175	eng	What became of Tom?
3393181	eng	It's not yet time.
3393182	eng	Let me take those.
3393183	eng	Did you order this?
3393184	eng	Have you read this?
3393185	eng	Should I take this?
3393186	eng	Do I deserve this?
3393187	eng	Just hang in there.
3393188	eng	Put it right there.
3393189	eng	Who put that there?
3393191	eng	Did you write that?
3393192	eng	It isn't like that.
3393194	eng	What a great story!
3393195	eng	It's a good story.
3393196	eng	Now just lie still.
3393198	eng	It was very simple.
3393201	eng	Come here a second.
3393202	eng	Excuse me a second.
3393203	eng	Just wait a second.
3393206	eng	Lie still and rest.
3393207	eng	Just try to relax.
3393208	eng	It sure is pretty.
3393212	eng	Get your own place.
3393213	eng	It was hot outside.
3393215	eng	Just fill this out.
3393216	eng	Is the window open?
3393217	eng	The trunk is open.
3393221	eng	Could we leave now?
3393222	eng	Could we order now?
3393226	eng	It was really nice.
3393227	eng	That was very nice.
3393228	eng	It really is nice.
3393231	eng	Excuse me a moment.
3393232	eng	What am I missing?
3393233	eng	Just wait a minute.
3393234	eng	Wait here a minute.
3393235	eng	Why should we mind?
3393239	eng	Would you hire me?
3393243	eng	Is there any left?
3393245	eng	Get ready to leave.
3393246	eng	Why should I leave?
3393255	eng	Did you borrow it?
3393256	eng	Would you risk it?
3393259	eng	Does it still hurt?
3393260	eng	Does your arm hurt?
3393261	eng	Get off your horse.
3393262	eng	Do you belong here?
3393264	eng	Just get back here.
3393265	eng	Just get down here.
3393266	eng	Just get over here.
3393269	eng	Does Tom need help?
3393270	eng	Perhaps I can help.
3393271	eng	They may need help.
3393272	eng	This ought to help.
3393275	eng	Hand me my hat.
3393276	eng	This is quite good.
3393277	eng	Were they any good?
3393280	eng	This isn't any fun.
3393282	eng	Just let me finish.
3393283	eng	Go ask your father.
3393284	eng	It might be enough.
3393285	eng	The park was empty.

3494955	eng	Tom unpacked his suitcase.
3494961	eng	Germany borders the Netherlands.
3494993	eng	Tom was caught speeding.
3495017	eng	It's an old picture.
3496013	eng	My fingertips are frozen.
3496217	eng	He had pale lips.
3496219	eng	His lips were pale.
3496233	eng	Give me a visual.
3496237	eng	I have a visual.
3496374	eng	Shop till you drop.
3496406	eng	Hail and farewell, brother.
3496540	eng	However, exceptions have occurred.
3496613	eng	Tom yanked Mary's ponytail.
3496645	eng	Tom unzipped his pants.
3496892	eng	Tom looks extremely nervous.
3496899	eng	Read this right away.
3498031	eng	Sometimes goodbyes aren't forever.
3498162	eng	The negotiations progressed slowly.
3498359	eng	Perhaps you'd better leave.
3498705	eng	That's just your imagination.
3500028	eng	He speaks so vividly.
3500861	eng	Look what I've found.
3501122	eng	I didn't decorate it.
3501295	eng	All things must pass.
3501426	eng	I am a giant!
3501483	eng	Even Homer sometimes nods.
3502125	eng	The illusion was perfect.
3502126	eng	The illusion is perfect.
3502151	eng	Mary doesn't understand that.
3502159	eng	Perhaps you'd better drive.
3502162	eng	Tom was nicely dressed.
3502950	eng	Tom suddenly lost consciousness.
3503186	eng	Everyone can live peacefully.
3503522	eng	I'll leave you tomorrow.
3504215	eng	Tom was incredibly bored.
3504257	eng	Why did Tom change?
3504260	eng	He's all by himself.
3504491	eng	Tom suppressed his anger.
3504678	eng	Tom was home alone.
3505654	eng	Justice must be done.
3506068	eng	I'm not boycotting you.
3506213	eng	We had fun yesterday.
3506456	eng	Keep your chin up.
3506543	eng	Can I borrow those?
3506597	eng	Tom isn't the traitor.
3506856	eng	Do whatever it takes.
3506858	eng	This is good sushi.
3506859	eng	Do you like surprises?
3507186	eng	Don't you dare cry!
3507541	eng	Now go on home.
3507571	eng	Even men sometimes cry.
3507572	eng	My jaw is sore.
3507573	eng	No one will care.
3507997	eng	Everything unknown is doubted.
3508005	eng	The cat is puzzled.
3508212	eng	I hate this rug.
3508216	eng	Everything'll be all right.
3508217	eng	Is everybody all right?
3508693	eng	That's a complex question.
3510719	eng	She's over her head.
3511227	eng	It's a huge mistake.
3511308	eng	Mount Fuji is beautiful.
3511515	eng	Tom said very little.
3511765	eng	Tom probably took it.
3511794	eng	Is Tom still interested?
3512039	eng	It's a great idea.
3513457	eng	Please come over here.
3513489	eng	How's your research going?
3513490	eng	How's your investigation going?
3513501	eng	Tom's a crack shot.
3513513	eng	Tom is chopping wood.
3513531	eng	Life begins at forty.
3513534	eng	Get Tom some food.
3513535	eng	It's awful, just awful.
3513583	eng	This sure is exciting.
3513622	eng	He talks without stopping.
3513757	eng	It is his photo.
3513759	eng	It is her photo.
3514838	eng	Mary's yawning and stretching.
3514920	eng	I hate that color.
3514936	eng	I'm feeling disconnected today.
3514982	eng	Hand me the briefcase.
3514984	eng	Does Tom like Boston?
3514990	eng	Don't make me blush.
3515061	eng	Your paintings are beautiful.
3515184	eng	Did you take anything?
3515185	eng	Do you remember anything?
3515249	eng	Right then, go home.
3515252	eng	I am very afraid.
3515279	eng	You can't get both.
3515286	eng	The name sounds familiar.
3515321	eng	What's this really about?
3515848	eng	Is your watch working?
3517208	eng	Please call me Tom.
3517215	eng	Tom looks different today.
3517813	eng	This was my idea.
3517912	eng	What are the options?
3517918	eng	Thanks for last night.
3518040	eng	I don't want sugar.
3518241	eng	Loose lips sink ships.
3518463	eng	It's not Tom's decision.
3518465	eng	Tom really respects you.
3518466	eng	Tom does like you.
3518513	eng	It just seems wrong.
3518515	eng	It's still not working.
3518516	eng	It's a family trait.
3518523	eng	It's an old stereotype.
3518525	eng	It's an ugly situation.
3518527	eng	It makes perfect sense.
3518529	eng	It's a good policy.
3518537	eng	It's not real money.
3518540	eng	It's really bothering me.
3518541	eng	It's been too long.
3518542	eng	It's a bad investment.
3518545	eng	It isn't much further.
3518547	eng	It's entirely my fault.
3518554	eng	It's been three days.
3518556	eng	It's a reasonable conclusion.
3518558	eng	It's never been clearer.
3518559	eng	It's not funny anymore.
3519146	eng	It proves absolutely nothing.
3519309	eng	No one's stopping you.
3519388	eng	Last night was wonderful.
3519390	eng	Look out your window.
3519394	eng	Nobody else showed up.
3519541	eng	It's good seeing you.
3519567	eng	They're waiting for us.
3519569	eng	Now it's your turn.
3519570	eng	Thank you for trying.
3519622	eng	They ran past Tom.
3519623	eng	They're afraid of Tom.
3519624	eng	They've still got Tom.
3519625	eng	They couldn't kill Tom.
3519626	eng	They haven't found Tom.
3519628	eng	They begin beating Tom.
3519630	eng	They're looking for Tom.
3519666	eng	They verbally abused Tom.
3519678	eng	They all congratulated Tom.
3519680	eng	They slowly approached Tom.
3520514	eng	He's a brilliant economist.
3520515	eng	She's a brilliant economist.
3520516	eng	Austria played against Australia.
3521026	eng	Getting visuals, all good.
3521819	eng	Nothing's wrong with Tom.
3521822	eng	Did you understand Tom?
3521825	eng	Who listens to Tom?
3521987	eng	This is perfectly legal.
3522083	eng	This is a hybrid.
3522289	eng	Some Asians eat dogs.
3522310	eng	The water is green.
3522830	eng	She is very sick.
3523571	eng	You can go there.
3524185	eng	Shouldn't we help Tom?
3524764	eng	There is a darkness.
3524779	eng	We are not old.
3524791	eng	There was a fight.
3524793	eng	Just you and me.
3525067	eng	Listen to my advice!
3525081	eng	I'm sure she's right.
3525085	eng	It's not bothering anyone.
3525093	eng	She's a great girl.
3525112	eng	I'm nothing like Mary.
3525155	eng	She smoked a cigar.
3525847	eng	The tree is burning.
3526702	eng	He's a reliable man.
3527235	eng	See you tomorrow morning!
3527248	eng	I really love Japanese.
3527258	eng	We have a guest.
3527268	eng	I have an apple.
3527395	eng	See you in court.
3527541	eng	Six comes before seven.
3527872	eng	Mary is a hottie.
3527937	eng	Somebody might've overheard you.
3528023	eng	I have my book.
3528072	eng	I like speaking Welsh.
3528170	eng	That was pretty awesome.
3528171	eng	Thanks for coming back.
3528176	eng	That's hard to believe.
3528204	eng	Don't call your father.
3528289	eng	I have been crying.
3528293	eng	The weather was rainy.
3528371	eng	Thanks for dropping by.
3528372	eng	My dad just called.
3528434	eng	There's always a choice.
3528440	eng	That's what you deserve.
3528441	eng	That's a minor detail.
3528516	eng	Never trust your enemy.
3528518	eng	That's not really enough.
3528519	eng	You can't have everything.
3528614	eng	Nothing unusual was found.
3528615	eng	That's not very friendly.
3528617	eng	That was very funny.
3528909	eng	Let's play word associations.
3529118	eng	This is incredibly good.
3529121	eng	I'm a busy guy.
3529322	eng	That's why we're here.
3529326	eng	We don't belong here.
3529888	eng	I'm always losing things.
3530021	eng	There's no one home.
3530022	eng	This place is horrible.
3530027	eng	This is really impressive.
3530028	eng	Thanks for pitching in.
3530277	eng	I'd like some information.
3530532	eng	I regret your departure.
3530635	eng	She's a born artist.
3530698	eng	I knew that already.
3530818	eng	Ammonia is a base.
3530828	eng	Your answer is important!
3531644	eng	Somebody is blackmailing me.
3531645	eng	Sometimes you surprise me.
3531646	eng	Thanks for meeting me.
3531754	eng	The pleasure was mine.
3531755	eng	Now wait a minute.
3531758	eng	Stop being so naive.
3531761	eng	That wasn't very nice.
3531776	eng	Tom lost his control.
3531796	eng	I'm unable to say.
3531823	eng	There is another option.
3531824	eng	That's a direct order.
3531825	eng	That's a great outfit.
3531831	eng	That's a great plan.
3531916	eng	That's not the question.
3531918	eng	That's an unusual request.
3531923	eng	There's nowhere to run.
3531924	eng	That's what I said.
3532131	eng	Show me your sketches.
3533753	eng	That's a nice story.
3533774	eng	I'm not impoverishing you.
3533915	eng	These things take time.
3533928	eng	I saw Mary yesterday.
3533931	eng	Look! A four-leafed clover!
3534048	eng	He is my husband.
3534051	eng	Tom is my relative.
3534070	eng	He respected Mr. Hayakawa.
3534214	eng	I've always respected Tom.
3534642	eng	The programme is over.
3534969	eng	The tiger licked him.
3535197	eng	My friend fancies you.
3535934	eng	No one is near.
3536213	eng	It's a local legend.
3536223	eng	Mary writes romance novels.
3536232	eng	Aren't you scared, Tom?
3536239	eng	This song seems familiar.
3536303	eng	The scientists used nanoparticles.
3536316	eng	It happens every night.
3536353	eng	That makes us even.
3536363	eng	He's a brilliant artist.
3536371	eng	We laughed like idiots.
3536396	eng	Give him another chance.
3537532	eng	Give her another chance.
3537666	eng	Keep walking straight ahead.
3538197	eng	The price is high.
3538230	eng	I shouldn't tell you.
3538399	eng	Tom quickly lost interest.
3538478	eng	He is very smart.
3539238	eng	Tom is a charmer.
3539241	eng	That's weird, isn't it?
3539390	eng	You're being too honest.
3539462	eng	He seems really nice.
3539512	eng	It was extremely weird.
3539517	eng	I swear, nothing happened.
3539613	eng	Thank God you're fine.
3540320	eng	It's a blood orange.
3540324	eng	That's a blood orange.
3541883	eng	That was absolutely unnecessary.
3541884	eng	What does "oncology" mean?
3541885	eng	I filled the glass.
3541886	eng	I've filled the glass.
3541887	eng	I filled a glass.
3541888	eng	I've filled a glass.
3541898	eng	It isn't nearly enough.
3542133	eng	I'd like to learn.
3542532	eng	Who does want change?
3542554	eng	All these are correct.
3542628	eng	My vocabulary is limited.
3542632	eng	He expresses himself badly.
3542636	eng	His vocabulary is inadequate.
3542651	eng	They were talking business.
3542792	eng	The debate was closed.
3543738	eng	Think global, act local.
3543739	eng	Think globally, act locally.
3544434	eng	He's a good bloke.
3544529	eng	Norway has surprised me.
3544549	eng	I sold the car.
3544605	eng	Hold up there, sergeant.
3545778	eng	I repair broken phones.
3545887	eng	We get along well.
3547283	eng	His irresponsibility astounds me.
3547351	eng	Forbidden fruit tastes best.
3549697	eng	Come on, admit it.
3549698	eng	Come on, hurry up.
3549699	eng	Come on, let's go.
3549700	eng	Come on, touch it.
3549701	eng	Come on, trust me.
3549734	eng	Tom became very famous.
3550097	eng	How hungry are you?
3550668	eng	He values the truth.
3550795	eng	We are being helped.
3550796	eng	We didn't see him.
3550797	eng	We didn't see her.
3550807	eng	It's quarter past one.
3550808	eng	It's half past one.
3551507	eng	Everyone stared at me.
3552433	eng	He has committed suicide.
3553015	eng	Tom likes Swiss cheese.
3553352	eng	I'm buttering the bread.
3553374	eng	Has the climate changed?
3553375	eng	Don't fret too much.
3553528	eng	Enough, stop this fight!
3553533	eng	We will decide later.
3553587	eng	Do not criticize anybody!
3554426	eng	Why is everybody laughing?
3554559	eng	I really want this.
3554575	eng	The plane is overbooked.
3555029	eng	French women are beautiful.
3555130	eng	What a chaotic day.
3555139	eng	Let's play football today.
3555141	eng	I need the sun.
3555144	eng	This is a genius.
3555145	eng	He's writing a letter.
3555174	eng	This tire is punctured.
3555182	eng	The moonlight is weak.
3555349	eng	Tom lied in bed.
3555407	eng	They continue being stubborn.
3555582	eng	No, I'm not crazy.
3555622	eng	I'm sick of lying.
3555785	eng	We'll see you off.
3557168	eng	The soul is immortal.
3558041	eng	They used this table.
3559471	eng	Some animals change gender.
3559896	eng	I'm glad you came.
3559962	eng	Here, let me help.
3559967	eng	I need help here.
3559996	eng	Is Tom badly hurt?
3560197	eng	No, I'm not stupid.
3560677	eng	Crying won't solve anything.
3560946	eng	"You're joking." "I'm not."
3560975	eng	They sound better live.
3560978	eng	Tom married her anyway.
3561299	eng	Maybe you'd better leave.
3561904	eng	They'll look after me.
3562475	eng	Hey, listen to me.
3562522	eng	Tom drew a spaceship.
3562533	eng	How's it feel now?
3562534	eng	My leg hurts now.
3562535	eng	How's it look now?
3562539	eng	Here, use my pen.
3562568	eng	This idea is controversial.
3562586	eng	Tom's eyes are shut.
3563054	eng	The message is clear.
3563056	eng	Is the message clear?
3563100	eng	Hey, I heard that.
3563507	eng	Why can't I drive?
3563509	eng	Who wants me dead?
3563510	eng	Who stole my keys?
3563511	eng	Who needs a drink?
3563512	eng	Who cooks for you?
3563611	eng	Wow, look at this.
3563612	eng	OK, let's do this.
3563729	eng	Should I call 911?
3563765	eng	Should I call 112?
3563792	eng	Now, open your eyes.
3563794	eng	Now, let's get going.
3563797	eng	Now, come over here.
3563801	eng	Now, this may hurt.
3563802	eng	Now, that's an idea.
3563807	eng	Now, please excuse me.
3563812	eng	Now, wait a minute.
3563813	eng	Now, let's go outside.
3563815	eng	Now, answer my question.
3563821	eng	Now, wait a second.
3563831	eng	Now, it's your turn.
3563946	eng	That's my gym bag.
3563948	eng	Send me the bill.
3563949	eng	Where's my appointment book?
3563950	eng	That's why I came.
3563952	eng	It's a nice change.
3563953	eng	I have no children.
3563954	eng	It's a good choice.
3563957	eng	The toast is cold.
3563958	eng	That's what I did.
3563964	eng	Are you both drunk?
3564111	eng	I'm afraid of dying.
3564112	eng	Come on, it's easy.
3564114	eng	It's a bad example.
3564116	eng	The boys are fine.
3564120	eng	My hands were full.
3564266	eng	You have enough time.
3564309	eng	They'll accept the gifts.
3564315	eng	Stop tormenting your brother.
3564692	eng	Now, join the game.
3564743	eng	It sounds like fun.
3564746	eng	The cops are gone.
3564748	eng	Take a break, guys.
3564750	eng	Sorry, I can't help.
3564941	eng	No one's been here.
3564942	eng	It smells in here.
3564943	eng	It's warm in here.
3564944	eng	It's cold out here.
3564946	eng	I'm not going home.
3564947	eng	I'd like a hug.
3564948	eng	No one's been hurt.
3564967	eng	I can't discuss it.
3564972	eng	Maybe I'll try it.
3565017	eng	Tom is a sexologist.
3565028	eng	That's all I knew.
3565029	eng	That's how I know.
3565030	eng	That's why I left.
3565031	eng	That's why I lied.
3565034	eng	Wow, thanks a lot.
3565036	eng	Look, just call me.
3565048	eng	Come on, follow me.
3565049	eng	Does it involve me?
3565050	eng	The team needs me.
3565051	eng	No one respects me.
3565052	eng	Go ahead, shoot me.
3565053	eng	Do they suspect me?
3565054	eng	Are you teasing me?
3565058	eng	I know your mother.
3565059	eng	Have I missed much?
3565067	eng	It's a common name.
3565069	eng	That's all I need.
3565072	eng	It's very late now.
3565074	eng	Are you scared now?
3565075	eng	The lid came off.
3565076	eng	The lights are on.
3565078	eng	Keep your shoes on.
3565079	eng	Are your eyes open?

3590960	eng	That's very good news.
3590963	eng	That's what I believe.
3590964	eng	That's what I figured.
3590978	eng	That could be anything.
3590982	eng	The door was unlocked.
3590989	eng	That hardly seems fair.

3591038	eng	That's very, very good.
3591039	eng	That's the whole story.
3591064	eng	That really isn't funny.
3591067	eng	That really isn't necessary.
3591085	eng	That's very good advice.
3591114	eng	That sounds really great.
3591117	eng	That was totally amazing.
3591118	eng	That was very reassuring.
3591137	eng	That's an excellent point.
3591139	eng	That's exactly the point.
3591141	eng	That's precisely the point.
3591251	eng	That's much more important.
3591253	eng	That sounds very important.
3591254	eng	That's important to know.
3591256	eng	That's not important now.
3591278	eng	That makes everything simpler.
3591638	eng	That's what I'm thinking.

3592623	eng	He is learning English.
3592855	eng	There are computers here.

3592898	eng	Tom is probably innocent.
3592899	eng	Tom's feelings are hurt.
3592907	eng	Tom closed the doors.
3592908	eng	That's why Tom died.
3592909	eng	Tom's wife just died.
3592912	eng	Tom's body was cremated.
3592914	eng	Tom's mood has changed.

3592918	eng	Tom stole your bike.
3593387	eng	That's a weird sentence.
3593396	eng	I ought to go.

3593975	eng	That depends on you.
3593976	eng	That's what I wrote.
3593979	eng	That's where I work.
3593981	eng	That might actually work.
3593982	eng	That's what I wanted.
3593983	eng	That's all I wanted.
3593985	eng	That's what I'd want.
3593987	eng	That's kind of vague.
3593988	eng	That's simply not true.
3593989	eng	That's not really true.
3593990	eng	That's an ugly tie.
3593991	eng	That's what I think.
3593992	eng	That might change things.
3593993	eng	That's a good thing.
3593995	eng	That looks like tea.
3593997	eng	That's a long story.
3593998	eng	That's a good story.
3593999	eng	That's a good start.
3594001	eng	That's a nice skirt.
3594004	eng	That might be serious.
3594005	eng	That makes no sense.
3594006	eng	That makes more sense.
3594007	eng	That's a good school.
3594013	eng	That's against the rules.
3594014	eng	That's kind of rude.
3594018	eng	That's a huge relief.
3594019	eng	That's a good reason.
3594020	eng	That's kind of rare.
3594022	eng	That stuff is poison.
3594023	eng	That's a brilliant plan.
3594024	eng	That's a generous offer.
3594025	eng	That's all over now.
3594026	eng	That's sort of nice.
3594027	eng	That feels very nice.

3594037	eng	That's what's worrying me.
3594038	eng	That's what terrifies me.
3594039	eng	That's what interests me.
3594042	eng	That's enough for me.
3594043	eng	That wouldn't help me.
3594044	eng	That really scares me.
3594050	eng	That could've hit me.
3594055	eng	That's a blatant lie.
3594056	eng	That can't be legal.
3594057	eng	That's why I'm late.
3594058	eng	That's nice to know.
3594059	eng	That's a nice jacket.
3594062	eng	That's more like it.
3594066	eng	That's not the issue.
3594068	eng	That was really intense.
3594069	eng	That's a wonderful idea.
3594070	eng	That's a crazy idea.
3594071	eng	That's a clever idea.
3594072	eng	That's our best hope.
3594073	eng	That might be helpful.
3594074	eng	That could be helpful.
3594076	eng	That seemed to help.
3594078	eng	That's what I heard.
3594079	eng	That's nice to hear.
3594080	eng	That's good to hear.
3594082	eng	That's my best guess.
3594083	eng	That's a good guess.

3594086	eng	That's a great gift.
3594089	eng	That looks like fun.
3594093	eng	That's a bit extreme.
3594094	eng	That's a lame excuse.
3594096	eng	That's a nice dress.
3594097	eng	That narrows things down.
3594098	eng	That narrows it down.
3594099	eng	That's already been done.
3594100	eng	That might be difficult.
3594101	eng	That's kind of deep.
3594104	eng	That's kind of cool.
3594107	eng	That makes things clear.
3594109	eng	That's a police car.
3594110	eng	That's why I called.
3594112	eng	That's a good brand.

3609277	eng	Tom brought an umbrella.
3609561	eng	You're talking about yourself.
3609563	eng	Talk about yourself, please.
3614724	eng	It's a fascinating read.
3614888	eng	Precautionary measures were unnecessary.
3615141	eng	I charge high rates.
3615693	eng	Whose container is this?
3616266	eng	Take out your notebooks!
3616269	eng	Take out your notebooks.
3616271	eng	Get out your notebooks.
3616301	eng	Please let me explain.
3616310	eng	What's your strongest language?
3616359	eng	My love costs nothing.
3617392	eng	I'm from the Netherlands.
3617399	eng	I'm from New Zealand.
3617994	eng	See what I did!
3618102	eng	I remember these faces.
3618419	eng	You seem far away.
3618423	eng	Teachers also make mistakes.
3618463	eng	This file is encrypted.
3618509	eng	I'm quitting my job.
3618516	eng	Tom looks very sad.
3618533	eng	The door isn't locked.
3618534	eng	The door is unlocked.
3618543	eng	I've never been kidnapped.
3618548	eng	I'm getting pretty tired.
3618559	eng	Tom was terribly disappointed.
3618560	eng	Tom looks well rested.
3618580	eng	Tom is completely bald.
3618583	eng	It's a complicated world.
3618598	eng	It's a bad neighborhood.
3618618	eng	It's a tough choice.
3618622	eng	It's a difficult choice.
3618656	eng	I'm just a housewife.
3618661	eng	I enjoy the challenge.
3618682	eng	It's a private joke.
3618684	eng	Tom's French is terrible.
3618701	eng	Tom, you've disappointed me.
3618742	eng	It's important to me.
3618864	eng	I'm not usually here.
3618890	eng	Tom should've eaten more.
3618926	eng	I think you'll lose.
3618945	eng	It's a commonly-used technique.
3618966	eng	Tom's technique is impressive.
3619010	eng	I'm having trouble breathing.
3619019	eng	Tom's family lost everything.
3619046	eng	I must be hallucinating.
3619047	eng	I feel like celebrating.
3619058	eng	It's a little annoying.
3619061	eng	Tom's hair is long.
3619083	eng	It's a perfect match.
3619085	eng	It's a minor glitch.
3619096	eng	I'm scared to death.
3619129	eng	Let's go get drunk.
3619130	eng	Tom is extremely drunk.
3619148	eng	It's a little personal.
3619157	eng	I remember every detail.
3619169	eng	Tom's hands are full.
3619251	eng	No one trusts Tom.
3619282	eng	It's a simple plan.
3619336	eng	It's a tense situation.
3619469	eng	Tom is half asleep.
3619489	eng	Tom is pretty sharp.
3619515	eng	I'm not a bartender.
3619560	eng	It's a private matter.
3619561	eng	I'm definitely feeling better.
3619585	eng	That's a pretty color.
3619705	eng	It's a plausible diagnosis.
3619750	eng	Tom is regaining consciousness.
3619764	eng	I appreciate your efforts.
3619767	eng	Tom shouldn't eat peanuts.
3619813	eng	I'll soon change that.
3619879	eng	It's a well-known fact.
3619881	eng	That's a frightening prospect.
3619894	eng	Tom is extremely upset.
3619895	eng	Tom isn't dead yet.
3619906	eng	I thought Tom left.
3619933	eng	It's a nice thought.
3619935	eng	That's a frightening thought.
3619936	eng	That's a horrifying thought.
3619977	eng	That's a definite improvement.
3620003	eng	Tom is awfully short.
3620004	eng	Tom is very short.
3620009	eng	Tom is eating breakfast.
3620090	eng	I'll listen to you.
3620208	eng	Tom looks tired today.
3620213	eng	Tom isn't here today.
3620346	eng	It's a rare opportunity.
3620347	eng	I appreciate this opportunity.
3620379	eng	What's Tom's real name?
3620830	eng	See you next class.
3621377	eng	Eternal love doesn't exist.
3622357	eng	Tom likes soft drinks.
3622863	eng	Welcome to our country!
3622866	eng	Come see me again.
3622867	eng	Our business is expanding.
3622884	eng	What is your commission?
3622905	eng	Tom plays the xylophone.
3622973	eng	I want a blanket.
3623572	eng	You're a rogue, Tom.
3623574	eng	You're a prankster, Tom.
3623578	eng	You're a mischief, Tom.
3624180	eng	This is a letter.
3624787	eng	Important guests arrive tomorrow.
3624857	eng	I forgot your number.
3626140	eng	Bike sheds are useful.
3626306	eng	We're kind of late.
3626565	eng	I am very scared.
3626566	eng	Maria is rather sweet.
3626567	eng	Safety always comes first.
3626569	eng	Have you studied abroad?
3626582	eng	I have big hands.
3626583	eng	I must sleep now.
3626613	eng	He loved to travel.
3626679	eng	It is frightfully expensive.
3627666	eng	We're not getting dressed.
3628033	eng	Where are your children?
3628277	eng	Is your sister here?
3628317	eng	He goes to university.
3628990	eng	Is this his umbrella?
3628992	eng	Is this her umbrella?
3628998	eng	Is that her umbrella?
3628999	eng	Is that his umbrella?
3629000	eng	Is that your umbrella?
3629949	eng	The moon is waning.
3630038	eng	The wind is howling.
3630641	eng	Look at this photo.
3630642	eng	Look at this photograph.
3630736	eng	Do you like anchovies?
3630762	eng	I'm using a computer.
3631109	eng	Marie fed the fish.
3631372	eng	I arrived last night.
3631388	eng	The prices fell suddenly.
3631392	eng	She suffers from anorexia.
3631402	eng	Don't forget to breathe.
3631469	eng	This explanation sounds confusing.
3631558	eng	The show was exciting.
3631916	eng	Tom's loud and domineering.
3633499	eng	These are my trousers.
3633605	eng	We like to play.
3633727	eng	I think she'll succeed.
3633845	eng	Mary likes country music.
3633846	eng	We ordered Chinese food.
3634054	eng	She texted her girlfriend.
3634265	eng	Who is buying what?
3634279	eng	Whose child are you?
3634316	eng	Everybody beats the fool.
3634563	eng	Do you sell fruit?
3634796	eng	I hope Tom wins.
3634812	eng	Tom probably won't win.
3634863	eng	Go with the flow.
3634878	eng	The man is meditating.
3635484	eng	Look at that photo.
3635487	eng	Look at this image.
3635488	eng	Look at that image.
3635537	eng	She is a professor.
3635625	eng	That says it all.
3635678	eng	She tuned her guitar.
3635690	eng	Her car overtook ours.
3635691	eng	Your car overtook ours.
3635791	eng	What a terrific idea!
3635792	eng	What a creative idea!
3635793	eng	What a marvelous idea!
3635794	eng	What a generous offer!
3635795	eng	What a dreadful color!
3635796	eng	What a lovely thought!
3635810	eng	This place smells bad.
3635815	eng	I'm off to bed.
3635817	eng	Tom has been disqualified.
3635820	eng	The doors are locked.
3635821	eng	Keep our eyes peeled.
3635823	eng	The doors are opened.
3635827	eng	The banks are closed.
3635828	eng	The doors are closed.
3635830	eng	Now let's get started.
3635831	eng	The house was deserted.
3635837	eng	The water's ice cold.
3635846	eng	I heard a sound.
3635848	eng	This sandwich is good.
3635849	eng	The fire feels good.
3635853	eng	We need some ice.
3635855	eng	It's an easy choice.
3635856	eng	It's now dark outside.
3635857	eng	A policeman is outside.
3635858	eng	My mommy went outside.
3635862	eng	It should be possible.
3635863	eng	Now you're in trouble.
3635865	eng	It wasn't any trouble.
3635867	eng	It's all quite simple.
3635871	eng	It really bugged me.
3635873	eng	Nobody ever helped me.
3635875	eng	It's not bugging me.
3635878	eng	Switch places with me.
3635880	eng	Nobody listens to me.
3635882	eng	Nobody ever helps me.
3635891	eng	Tom followed me home.
3635893	eng	We're going back home.
3635896	eng	It's never been done.
3635897	eng	My shift's almost done.
3635898	eng	Everybody else is gone.
3635900	eng	It's your only hope.
3635901	eng	Tom needs medical care.
3635902	eng	Something is odd here.
3635906	eng	Tom followed me here.
3635913	eng	It's noisy in here.
3635914	eng	It's scary down here.
3635915	eng	It's right over here.
3635917	eng	My roommate is here.
3635918	eng	Tom followed us here.
3635921	eng	It's strangely quiet here.
3635922	eng	It's very quiet here.
3635923	eng	It's all right here.
3635924	eng	It's freezing out here.
3635927	eng	My parents are there.
3635929	eng	It's just over there.
3635933	eng	We've discussed this before.
3635935	eng	I'm not teaching anymore.
3635936	eng	Go grab your briefcase.
3635942	eng	I forgot my purse.
3635945	eng	I checked the date.
3635946	eng	Maybe we're too late.
3635947	eng	It's almost too late.
3635948	eng	It's kind of private.
3635949	eng	There is no antidote.
3635951	eng	Just relax a minute.
3635952	eng	Maybe I should leave.
3635953	eng	I really should leave.
3635956	eng	Maybe you're in love.
3635957	eng	It's the right size.
3635958	eng	Take your shoes off.
3635960	eng	It's your night off.
3635964	eng	Forget the whole thing.
3635968	eng	The police are coming.
3635974	eng	It's only a painting.
3635975	eng	The buses are leaving.
3635977	eng	It's taking too long.
3635978	eng	It's where I belong.
3635986	eng	You're not tall enough.
3635988	eng	Please let me finish.
3635996	eng	Go grab your backpack.
3636012	eng	This thing isn't real.
3636013	eng	It's all quite normal.
3636014	eng	It's sort of personal.
3636024	eng	Everyone needs a dream.
3636025	eng	Maybe I fooled them.
3636028	eng	I already called Tom.
3636029	eng	I've already called Tom.
3636036	eng	Don't leave this room.
3636040	eng	It's an excellent plan.
3636043	eng	This seat isn't taken.
3636044	eng	Keep your ears open.
3636049	eng	It's easy to explain.
3636052	eng	It's worth the pain.
3636053	eng	I hate the rain.
3636059	eng	Make your own decision.
3636062	eng	It'll be light soon.
3636066	eng	This looks like fun.
3636067	eng	Now I'm having fun.
3636069	eng	Another day has begun.
3636072	eng	My house burned down.
3636078	eng	Maybe I should go.
3636085	eng	My leg's still asleep.
3636088	eng	Maybe we should stop.
3636095	eng	Get into your car.
3636113	eng	My shift's almost over.
3636115	eng	Get me another lawyer.
3636118	eng	I'm a private investigator.
3636120	eng	We've got a visitor.
3636122	eng	I missed you kids.
3636130	eng	Maybe I deserve this.
3636134	eng	Let's not discuss this.
3636137	eng	Don't try any tricks.
3636142	eng	Put down your weapons.
3636149	eng	Come downtown with us.
3636151	eng	It's over between us.
3636155	eng	This could be serious.
3636156	eng	It makes me curious.
3636157	eng	It makes me jealous.
3636162	eng	Being married is great.
3636163	eng	I need a hat.
3636166	eng	It's older than that.
3636177	eng	Maybe we should fight.
3636178	eng	It'll be cold tonight.
3636191	eng	Maybe we should wait.
3636193	eng	Maybe I should quit.
3636195	eng	It's totally my fault.
3636197	eng	Tom isn't an adult.
3636198	eng	It's kind of important.
3636200	eng	Just relax a moment.
3636201	eng	It's your only shot.
3636206	eng	Maybe we should start.
3636210	eng	What's past is past.
3636212	eng	That's an odd request.
3636213	eng	Please hear me out.
3636214	eng	It's still dark out.
3636216	eng	We'll work this out.
3636217	eng	I may outlive you.
3636218	eng	It's right above you.
3636220	eng	Maybe I'll call you.
3636225	eng	Nobody can hear you.
3636231	eng	Look, I'll show you.
3636233	eng	Roll down the window.
3636236	eng	There's no choice now.
3636241	eng	You should go now.
3636246	eng	It'll be different now.
3636252	eng	Have a wonderful day.
3636254	eng	It's still my birthday.
3636257	eng	I wasn't born yesterday.
3636258	eng	I loved the play.
3636261	eng	It's easier this way.
3636263	eng	It's too late anyway.
3636264	eng	It's still not ready.
3636265	eng	Your shoes are muddy.
3636266	eng	You owe me money.
3636270	eng	Tom demanded an apology.
3636271	eng	It's still too early.
3636278	eng	Now I'm getting angry.
3636279	eng	Come on, let's hurry.
3636280	eng	It's useless to try.
3636285	eng	These boxes are heavy.
3636286	eng	Maybe I'm just crazy.
3636291	eng	Are we almost finished?
3636292	eng	Are we nearly finished?
3636293	eng	Are you really married?
3636294	eng	Why's the door locked?
3636295	eng	Why wasn't I informed?
3636297	eng	Have you already ordered?
3636302	eng	What changed Tom's mind?
3636306	eng	What smells so good?
3636307	eng	Is everybody on board?
3636309	eng	Who called the police?
3636310	eng	How was choir practice?
3636311	eng	Is it windy outside?
3636314	eng	How's your love life?
3636318	eng	What's it sound like?
3636319	eng	What's it look like?
3636320	eng	What's it smell like?
3636321	eng	What's Tom really like?
3636322	eng	Am I being unreasonable?
3636323	eng	Do I look presentable?
3636325	eng	Have you betrayed me?
3636328	eng	Were you following me?
3636330	eng	Who's looking at me?
3636332	eng	What's your real name?
3636334	eng	What's his first name?
3636342	eng	Are you finished here?
3636350	eng	Why's Tom still here?
3636355	eng	Who invited you here?
3636359	eng	Does it hurt anywhere?
3636360	eng	Are you hurt anywhere?
3636365	eng	Could you please leave?
3636371	eng	What's Tom scared of?
3636372	eng	What's Tom afraid of?
3636373	eng	Have I missed anything?
3636374	eng	How's your kid doing?
3636375	eng	How's your boy doing?
3636377	eng	How are things going?
3636378	eng	How's your day going?
3636380	eng	Who invited Tom along?
3636383	eng	Where's my coffee mug?
3636384	eng	Isn't that good enough?
3636387	eng	How about a snack?
3636388	eng	Are you really sick?
3636390	eng	Are you seriously ill?
3636395	eng	Can't we start again?
3636399	eng	What's your final destination?
3636407	eng	What's your father do?
3636409	eng	Is Tom there, too?
3636413	eng	What's your biggest fear?
3636419	eng	Is anything the matter?
3636421	eng	What's it stand for?
3636422	eng	Who're you looking for?
3636423	eng	What's Tom waiting for?
3636424	eng	Who locked the door?
3636433	eng	Did you foresee this?
3636435	eng	What would cause this?
3636436	eng	Whose phone is this?
3636437	eng	What exactly is this?
3636438	eng	Could we discuss this?
3636440	eng	Who called the cops?
3636442	eng	Have you betrayed us?
3636444	eng	Are you still nauseous?
3636447	eng	What's the bad news?
3636450	eng	Who's Tom looking at?
3636451	eng	What're you staring at?
3636452	eng	Isn't this place great?
3636453	eng	Do you understand that?
3636454	eng	What would cause that?
3636461	eng	Whose plan was that?
3636462	eng	What exactly was that?
3636469	eng	Are you finished yet?
3636470	eng	Have you started yet?
3636472	eng	Are you losing weight?
3636481	eng	Is there another exit?
3636482	eng	So what's your point?
3636486	eng	What's the movie about?
3636487	eng	What's on the menu?
3636488	eng	Who else helped you?
3636491	eng	Where exactly are you?
3636494	eng	Are we disturbing you?

3636946	eng	Where exactly is she?
3637087	eng	Oh, it is me!

3721636	eng	No expense was spared.
3721638	eng	Your days are numbered.
3721642	eng	Tom's daughter was murdered.
3721648	eng	Tom isn't so well-mannered.
3721655	eng	My arms are tired.
3721659	eng	I hate being bored.
3721666	eng	Tom is being tortured.
3721671	eng	That's what I promised.
3721686	eng	Tom was evidently embarrassed.
3721690	eng	Tom was very depressed.
3721691	eng	The group was impressed.
3721692	eng	Tom was deeply impressed.
3721695	eng	Our paths have crossed.
3721700	eng	Tom's imagination was aroused.
3721741	eng	The office was deserted.
3721742	eng	The office is deserted.
3721753	eng	Tom was momentarily interested.
3721761	eng	Tom's patience was exhausted.
3721792	eng	That can't be allowed.
3721796	eng	Tom was extremely annoyed.
3721804	eng	Tom was terribly afraid.
3721820	eng	You're a weird kid.
3721823	eng	Tom lifted the lid.
3721825	eng	I'm not being paranoid.
3721831	eng	It's actually incredibly stupid.
3721836	eng	I suddenly felt old.
3721840	eng	Tom suddenly felt cold.
3721843	eng	Tom was very cold.
3721844	eng	Tom removed Mary's blindfold.
3721846	eng	Tom is on hold.
3721863	eng	Fire on my command.
3721867	eng	That's where I stand.
3721872	eng	Tom seemed to understand.
3721900	eng	You're the perfect girlfriend.
3721901	eng	You're the perfect boyfriend.
3721903	eng	It's a special blend.
3721912	eng	I know your kind.
3721924	eng	Tom is a mastermind.
3721954	eng	There was no sound.
3721955	eng	I felt like God.
3721959	eng	We'll grow more food.
3721973	eng	That was no good.
3721976	eng	It feels so good.
3721977	eng	That feels so good.
3721980	eng	Tom's appetite was good.
3721981	eng	Tom's reputation is good.
3721987	eng	They aren't that good.
3721990	eng	Tom was really good.
3721991	eng	That sounds really good.
3721995	eng	I've been pretty good.
3721996	eng	That sounds pretty good.
3721997	eng	There goes the neighborhood.
3722002	eng	I wish I understood.
3722007	eng	You look positively haggard.
3722008	eng	That shouldn't be hard.
3722012	eng	Let's not go overboard.
3722019	eng	It's kind of awkward.
3722020	eng	It's a bit awkward.
3722023	eng	It sounds pretty straightforward.
3722025	eng	That's a little weird.
3722036	eng	I'll spread the word.
3722037	eng	We'll spread the word.
3722042	eng	Tom unsheathed his sword.
3722043	eng	Tom lowered his sword.
3722066	eng	Cookie licked Tom's face.
3722086	eng	We'll leave this place.
3722106	eng	I'm not the police.
3722109	eng	I can be nice.
3722110	eng	That might be nice.
3722119	eng	It's the logical choice.
3722124	eng	Now it's your choice.
3722125	eng	It's your only choice.
3722137	eng	Everything has its price.
3722145	eng	We value your advice.
3722156	eng	It's worth the chance.
3722161	eng	It's your last chance.
3722163	eng	It's your best chance.
3722164	eng	I had my chance.
3722171	eng	It's of no importance.
3722175	eng	We require no assistance.
3722181	eng	I've discovered new evidence.
3722185	eng	Tom wanted an audience.
3722190	eng	There was dead silence.
3722193	eng	Tom broke the silence.
3722195	eng	There was complete silence.
3722199	eng	They ate in silence.
3722201	eng	Tom motioned for silence.
3722202	eng	Please forgive my impertinence.
3722219	eng	I'll make myself scarce.
3722223	eng	The bed is unmade.
3722229	eng	We're investigating a homicide.
3722235	eng	I suggest you hide.
3722237	eng	We took a ride.
3722254	eng	Tom's eyes opened wide.
3722261	eng	My services are free.
3722269	eng	I climbed a tree.
3722286	eng	That much I guarantee.
3722288	eng	We have no guarantee.
3722293	eng	I have a life.
3722294	eng	I want a life.
3722313	eng	You were my life.
3722346	eng	Tom turned another page.
3722350	eng	They've increased Tom's dosage.
3722354	eng	I checked the gauge.
3722370	eng	That's about to change.
3722376	eng	It's all very strange.
3722381	eng	I'll take that challenge.
3722387	eng	Save yourself the headache.
3722398	eng	Nobody deserves to die.
3722404	eng	You're one sharp cookie.
3722407	eng	That's a stinking lie.
3722418	eng	They're hard to make.
3722426	eng	You were a mistake.
3722428	eng	It's an honest mistake.
3722450	eng	It was a fluke.
3722452	eng	Tom was very pale.
3722454	eng	Tom's reputation is impeccable.
3722456	eng	I think that's understandable.
3722458	eng	It's unique and irreplaceable.
3722459	eng	I've done something unforgivable.
3722462	eng	There isn't one available.
3722466	eng	It seems perfectly reasonable.
3722470	eng	Tom's loyalty is admirable.
3722471	eng	They say it's incurable.
3722481	eng	It might be profitable.
3722489	eng	It made me uncomfortable.
3722490	eng	It was rather uncomfortable.
3722491	eng	Tom is extremely unstable.
3722493	eng	That meal was incredible.
3722495	eng	You're not so horrible.
3722496	eng	The whiskey was horrible.
3722519	eng	I'm in desperate trouble.
3722526	eng	Call if there's trouble.
3722528	eng	I always expect trouble.
3722537	eng	I have to skedaddle.
3722538	eng	Tom turned the handle.
3722545	eng	Tom was an imbecile.
3722549	eng	Tom waited a while.
3722568	eng	I make you smile.
3722572	eng	It was quite simple.
3722573	eng	The process is simple.
3722574	eng	Let's make this simple.
3722575	eng	It's never that simple.
3722576	eng	It's all very simple.
3722577	eng	Let's settle down, people.
3722582	eng	You're frightening these people.
3722593	eng	These are my people.
3722605	eng	Tom stiffened a little.
3722606	eng	Tom stammered a little.
3722613	eng	I'll take the bottle.
3722614	eng	You almost had me.
3722620	eng	You've already thanked me.
3722621	eng	You already thanked me.
3722623	eng	You could've fooled me.
3722627	eng	Tom immediately recognized me.
3722630	eng	Say you understand me.
3722655	eng	You can owe me.
3722669	eng	Thanks for asking me.
3722671	eng	Thanks for telling me.
3722673	eng	One thing's bothering me.
3722677	eng	They can't touch me.
3722688	eng	Please bear with me.
3722690	eng	Don't toy with me.
3722702	eng	Move away from me.
3722708	eng	It'll be on me.
3722723	eng	Tom turned to me.
3722737	eng	You'll talk to me.
3722749	eng	You're precious to me.
3722789	eng	That's what worries me.
3722796	eng	That's what troubles me.
3722797	eng	His name escapes me.
3722800	eng	That's what concerns me.
3722801	eng	That's what bothers me.
3722807	eng	Everybody yells at me.
3722857	eng	They're investigating a crime.
3722867	eng	We'll make the time.
3722874	eng	Now isn't the time.
3722909	eng	You're losing precious time.
3722913	eng	It's the right time.
3722923	eng	We should talk sometime.
3722924	eng	You need some downtime.
3722925	eng	There's more to come.
3722945	eng	You're looking extraordinarily handsome.
3722946	eng	You're getting very tiresome.
3722949	eng	Somebody sabotaged this plane.
3722953	eng	Tom uncorked the champagne.
3722955	eng	I paid a fine.
3722958	eng	I think we're fine.
3722961	eng	That's hard to imagine.
3722979	eng	Tom tasted the wine.
3722987	eng	You're an odd one.
3722989	eng	You're the married one.
3722990	eng	Have a good one.
3722992	eng	You're the strange one.
3722993	eng	I'm the insane one.
3722996	eng	I could use one.
3722997	eng	It's a tough one.
3722998	eng	You're the cool one.
3722999	eng	Tom knew no one.
3723002	eng	Tom's a clever one.
3723021	eng	I'm the crazy one.
3723029	eng	The deal is done.
3723036	eng	The magic is gone.
3723037	eng	The truck is gone.
3723039	eng	I need you gone.
3723049	eng	Tom might arrive alone.
3723053	eng	Tom never killed anyone.
3723066	eng	Just sit tight, everyone.
3723077	eng	It's our one hope.
3723080	eng	You're our best hope.
3723083	eng	I'm your only hope.
3723087	eng	I know the type.
3723104	eng	Tom's feet were bare.
3723144	eng	You're playing with fire.
3723171	eng	I'm the victim here.
3723187	eng	I'm burning up here.
3723189	eng	It's lovely up here.
3723192	eng	The door's over here.
3723194	eng	Tom, look who's here.
3723197	eng	We're the victims here.
3723211	eng	Let's be honest here.
3723212	eng	It's not just here.
3723225	eng	Tom just stood there.
3723228	eng	I must be there.
3723231	eng	Tell me you're there.
3723235	eng	There was something there.
3723237	eng	It's just sitting there.
3723246	eng	It's all in there.
3723254	eng	Tom's fiancée was there.
3723260	eng	We were almost there.
3723261	eng	You were almost there.
3723276	eng	It's in here somewhere.
3723280	eng	Tom's mind was elsewhere.
3723281	eng	Tom's mind is elsewhere.
3723285	eng	Just put them anywhere.
3723292	eng	I've been looking everywhere.
3723293	eng	We have branches everywhere.
3723299	eng	Tom began to perspire.
3723302	eng	We know the score.
3723307	eng	That wasn't here before.
3723326	eng	I needed something more.
3723372	eng	Tom aims to please.
3723378	eng	Let's go for Chinese.
3723379	eng	I needed the exercise.
3723381	eng	It's a reasonable compromise.
3723382	eng	Tom made a noise.
3723387	eng	Tom showed no surprise.
3723392	eng	The charges were false.
3723415	eng	It's just common sense.
3723416	eng	That's just common sense.
3723420	eng	Tom was talking nonsense.
3723422	eng	The mood is tense.
3723423	eng	The crew is tense.
3723424	eng	Tom made no response.
3723428	eng	That was too close.
3723429	eng	Boy that was close.
3723430	eng	Tom held Mary close.
3723431	eng	That's not very close.
3723440	eng	It just gets worse.
3723441	eng	I've made it worse.
3723442	eng	It only got worse.
3723446	eng	There's no third course.
3723450	eng	I really can't refuse.
3723459	eng	That's open to debate.
3723475	eng	It's just not appropriate.
3723476	eng	It was totally inappropriate.
3723480	eng	Tom was too late.
3723483	eng	Tom was hours late.
3723486	eng	Wow, it's really late.
3723492	eng	Tom was so considerate.
3723501	eng	My happiness is complete.
3723507	eng	I'm sick of white.
3723514	eng	Tom has excellent taste.
3723516	eng	Tom lit another cigarette.
3723518	eng	That was very cute.
3723531	eng	That's a little vague.
3723537	eng	The rumors are true.
3723539	eng	But that isn't true.
3723540	eng	That simply isn't true.
3723541	eng	That's not totally true.
3723542	eng	That wasn't exactly true.
3723543	eng	You're ducking the issue.
3723559	eng	I'm not Tom's slave.
3723568	eng	Something has to give.
3723575	eng	I need Tom alive.
3723583	eng	Go on the offensive.
3723592	eng	Tom was always secretive.
3723602	eng	It's a good move.
3723603	eng	That's a good move.
3723606	eng	I can barely move.
3723618	eng	You've got to apologize.
3723633	eng	Tom sighed with relief.
3723635	eng	I'll make this brief.
3723638	eng	Tom began to sniff.
3723644	eng	Call your people off.
3723647	eng	You ticked them off.
3723653	eng	They blew you off.
3723658	eng	This is emotional stuff.
3723660	eng	You know your stuff.
3723664	eng	Tom could've kicked himself.
3723674	eng	Tom was defending himself.
3723681	eng	Tom couldn't contain himself.
3723682	eng	Tom snickered to himself.
3723691	eng	You're no prize yourself.
3723696	eng	Just keep to yourself.
3723697	eng	You can't help yourself.
3723699	eng	Just see for yourself.
3723702	eng	Just look at yourself.
3723710	eng	I can drive myself.
3723712	eng	I was defending myself.
3723718	eng	I smiled to myself.
3723730	eng	I need solid proof.
3723733	eng	Tom is a scumbag.
3723734	eng	It's a great gag.
3723737	eng	Tom lost a leg.
3723741	eng	You're a disgusting pig.
3723742	eng	You're a lying pig.
3723745	eng	This is very disturbing.
3723746	eng	Tom resumed his pacing.
3723760	eng	I've done some bartending.
3723761	eng	My ears were pounding.
3723762	eng	The alarm started ringing.
3723765	eng	I've done some soul-searching.
3723769	eng	You look positively ravishing.
3723783	eng	Promise me one thing.
3723785	eng	We want one thing.
3723791	eng	There's no such thing.
3723808	eng	Tom could sense something.
3723816	eng	I'm on to something.
3723843	eng	We could see nothing.
3723844	eng	Tom could see nothing.
3723845	eng	They could see nothing.
3723849	eng	Tom could do nothing.
3723854	eng	Tom has got nothing.
3723865	eng	It could mean anything.
3723878	eng	You can't say anything.
3723881	eng	That has changed everything.
3723884	eng	You can't see everything.
3723886	eng	That should solve everything.
3723887	eng	I've been trying everything.
3723891	eng	People tell doctors everything.
3723894	eng	I'm telling you everything.
3723896	eng	Your hand is shaking.
3723899	eng	That's your pride talking.
3723900	eng	Hey, now we're talking.
3723901	eng	There's been enough talking.
3723903	eng	Please refrain from talking.
3723904	eng	Listen to who's talking.
3723906	eng	People will start talking.
3723909	eng	Listen, I've been thinking.
3723912	eng	Tom spoke without thinking.
3723913	eng	The light was blinking.
3723921	eng	That's all I'm asking.
3723923	eng	Pardon me for asking.
3723925	eng	It does sound appealing.
3723934	eng	This is quite puzzling.
3723936	eng	The crowd was screaming.
3723941	eng	I know it's coming.
3723947	eng	Tom had it coming.
3723952	eng	The noise is deafening.
3723954	eng	We understand what's happening.
3723959	eng	It sounds downright frightening.
3723995	eng	That's where I'm going.
3723996	eng	That's why I'm going.
3723999	eng	This isn't exactly helping.
3724004	eng	Tom's confidence is wavering.
3724007	eng	It just sounds boring.
3724008	eng	Dinner was incredibly boring.
3724011	eng	Tom is quite enterprising.
3724013	eng	It's a little embarrassing.
3724014	eng	Now, that's just embarrassing.
3724016	eng	We ended up kissing.
3724019	eng	There's a girl missing.
3724020	eng	It was very confusing.
3724024	eng	That's certainly worth investigating.
3724025	eng	That's what I'm investigating.
3724026	eng	This is really humiliating.
3724027	eng	Today has been exhilarating.
3724036	eng	Dinner will be waiting.
3724039	eng	I'm definitely not waiting.
3724049	eng	You're evil and disgusting.
3724051	eng	That's what I'm betting.
3724057	eng	I'm not worth saving.
3724071	eng	That's all I'm saying.
3724072	eng	That's what I'm saying.
3724080	eng	The girls were crying.
3724086	eng	Hey, I'm still trying.
3724090	eng	It was absolutely amazing.
3724093	eng	It'll take too long.
3724099	eng	OK, people, move along.
3724106	eng	I wouldn't play along.
3724107	eng	That's where you belong.
3724109	eng	It made me strong.
3724115	eng	I've found nothing wrong.
3724117	eng	That's just plain wrong.
3724125	eng	Tom was invariably wrong.
3724128	eng	The day's still young.
3724130	eng	The crowd is young.
3724131	eng	I'm pulling the plug.
3724154	eng	There's always a catch.
3724157	eng	You've met your match.
3724159	eng	I'll take first watch.
3724172	eng	You've done so much.
3724175	eng	I suspected as much.
3724182	eng	The cotton is high.
3724183	eng	Tom gave a sigh.
3724186	eng	It's important to laugh.
3724192	eng	That seems simple enough.
3724197	eng	That's not soon enough.
3724199	eng	It looks harmless enough.
3724201	eng	That's a little rough.
3724202	eng	Tom's promotion came through.
3724209	eng	We're only halfway through.
3724216	eng	Use whatever you wish.
3724217	eng	Believe whatever you wish.
3724218	eng	That was very harsh.
3724219	eng	It was an ambush.
3724231	eng	They're out of breath.
3724237	eng	Let's do the math.
3724240	eng	I chose another path.
3724241	eng	I'll take this path.
3724298	eng	Go with the truth.
3724312	eng	That'll stop the leak.
3724319	eng	Tom still didn't speak.
3724322	eng	We got a break.
3724326	eng	You've always been weak.
3724327	eng	Tom was too weak.
3724336	eng	It's all coming back.
3724337	eng	You'll get them back.
3724350	eng	We go way back.
3724378	eng	Get in here quick.
3724379	eng	You catch on quick.
3724380	eng	I'll make this quick.
3724384	eng	I'm off the clock.
3724386	eng	I suggest you duck.
3724391	eng	You're pushing your luck.
3724394	eng	I admire your pluck.
3724400	eng	That was last week.
3724419	eng	Tom ate and drank.
3724437	eng	Tom refreshed his drink.
3724447	eng	Please pop the trunk.
3724455	eng	You're off the hook.
3724457	eng	They exchanged a look.
3724461	eng	Let's take another look.
3724468	eng	Tom speared the shark.
3724472	eng	The crowd went berserk.
3724476	eng	It'll be hard work.
3724490	eng	I refuse to work.
3724511	eng	I made it work.
3724516	eng	I'll start the paperwork.
3724525	eng	That's no easy task.
3724543	eng	Timing would be critical.
3724551	eng	Let's do the deal.
3724559	eng	The pain was real.
3724568	eng	It could be beneficial.
3724569	eng	Tom's injuries are superficial.
3724571	eng	You were an animal.
3724574	eng	Tom is completely delusional.
3724577	eng	You're making this personal.
3724591	eng	The feeling was mutual.
3724595	eng	That's how I feel.
3724611	eng	You'll die in jail.
3724616	eng	I'll take this trail.
3724629	eng	Tom remembered it all.
3724652	eng	This isn't going well.
3724657	eng	I taught you well.
3724658	eng	It went extremely well.
3724662	eng	I do pretty well.
3724665	eng	That's a buzz kill.
3724669	eng	Tom lay perfectly still.
3724674	eng	We're ready to roll.
3724676	eng	It was half full.
3724678	eng	It sounds really cool.
3724679	eng	That seems pretty cool.
3724688	eng	Tom disappeared after school.
3724721	eng	Give it a whirl.
3724729	eng	They are so beautiful.
3724736	eng	You've been most helpful.
3724737	eng	Tom was quite successful.
3724738	eng	That was very hurtful.
3724772	eng	We're cuter than them.
3724776	eng	Hang on to them.
3724780	eng	Tom glared at them.
3724807	eng	Nobody remembers seeing him.
3724830	eng	I must be calm.
3724833	eng	It's not authentic, Tom.
3724838	eng	Leave it be, Tom.
3724871	eng	This way please, Tom.
3724877	eng	That's good thinking, Tom.
3724881	eng	That's very amusing, Tom.
3724887	eng	Dial it back, Tom.
3724900	eng	Dial it down, Tom.
3724927	eng	You're all heart, Tom.
3724930	eng	Knock yourself out, Tom.
3724953	eng	You've done admirably, Tom.
3724971	eng	Somebody might've followed Tom.
3724976	eng	I highly recommend Tom.
3725006	eng	This isn't like Tom.
3725012	eng	You've certainly outdone Tom.
3725029	eng	I've heard of Tom.
3725034	eng	Get off of Tom.
3725051	eng	I've been seeing Tom.
3725058	eng	There's no stopping Tom.
3725089	eng	I'm through with Tom.
3725245	eng	Keep looking for Tom.
3725272	eng	This directly concerns Tom.
3725292	eng	You should consult Tom.
3725300	eng	Maybe I hurt Tom.
3725351	eng	Tom entered the room.
3725363	eng	There isn't much room.
3725382	eng	Tom touched my arm.
3725383	eng	You've done enough harm.
3725391	eng	Spare me the sarcasm.
3725404	eng	The boat was clean.
3725420	eng	I'm an old woman.
3725426	eng	You're quite a craftsman.
3725427	eng	They are almost human.
3725428	eng	Tom was an artilleryman.
3725431	eng	I'm taking the minivan.
3725452	eng	These are dangerous men.
3725464	eng	Come in, it's open.
3725466	eng	Let's get it open.
3725470	eng	This is what'll happen.
3725479	eng	Nothing has to happen.
3725508	eng	You must come in.
3725515	eng	Just let Tom in.
3725516	eng	You should turn in.
3725540	eng	The door opened again.
3725554	eng	You're being negative again.
3725555	eng	You're showing off again.
3725563	eng	The music began again.
3725565	eng	We'll be together again.
3725572	eng	Let's try this again.
3725573	eng	Tom went upstairs again.
3725577	eng	All is quiet again.
3725579	eng	You'll see it again.
3725587	eng	Tom became angry again.
3725589	eng	Somebody's yanking my chain.
3725590	eng	Look, I can explain.
3725600	eng	I'm racking my brain.
3725603	eng	I've been eating protein.
3725605	eng	Let the games begin.
3725606	eng	Tom rubbed his chin.
3725616	eng	You're guilty as sin.
3725622	eng	Try to hang on.
3725626	eng	See what's going on.
3725632	eng	The party's back on.
3725638	eng	We value your opinion.
3725640	eng	It's a special occasion.
3725645	eng	I await your decision.
3725651	eng	We need a diversion.
3725652	eng	Tom suffered from depression.
3725664	eng	There's been a complication.
3725665	eng	It's an ongoing investigation.
3725667	eng	I had a revelation.
3725670	eng	I've got inside information.
3725672	eng	They were collecting information.
3725679	eng	I'll use my imagination.
3725685	eng	You were my inspiration.
3725716	eng	It's for your protection.
3725717	eng	You're under my protection.
3725719	eng	Tom had no ambition.
3725723	eng	You know my position.
3725727	eng	That's an amusing notion.
3725735	eng	That's hardly an option.
3725738	eng	That's not a question.
3725739	eng	Tom sidestepped the question.
3725769	eng	It'll wear off soon.
3725781	eng	Tom embraced his son.
3725795	eng	It's now planting season.
3725803	eng	Tom went to prison.
3725809	eng	I'm a people person.
3725811	eng	You're a strong person.
3725812	eng	You're an evil person.
3725823	eng	You're finished in Boston.
3725842	eng	We're halfway to Boston.
3725849	eng	That's of no concern.
3725859	eng	I may not return.
3725863	eng	You've had your fun.
3725871	eng	Tom tried to run.
3725872	eng	Tom started to run.
3725881	eng	The laughter died down.
3725884	eng	The car slowed down.
3725888	eng	You wore me down.
3725889	eng	You're bringing me down.
3725893	eng	Put the bag down.
3725894	eng	Tom feared falling down.
3725896	eng	Tom wouldn't back down.
3725903	eng	They turned us down.
3725908	eng	The fuse is blown.
3725919	eng	It's what I'd do.
3725923	eng	I think that'll do.
3725924	eng	I guess that'll do.
3725975	eng	It'll have to do.
3726013	eng	Tom turned to go.
3726015	eng	We're good to go.
3726019	eng	You're clear to go.
3726026	eng	OK, people, let's go.
3726029	eng	I let it go.
3726030	eng	We're letting you go.
3726052	eng	Somebody should say hello.
3726067	eng	I'm under suspicion, too.
3726100	eng	Settle down, you two.
3726113	eng	It'll help you sleep.
3726116	eng	Tom was still asleep.
3726118	eng	Get lost, you creep.
3726119	eng	Read it and weep.
3726122	eng	I'm in a relationship.
3726126	eng	Tom chewed his lip.
3726132	eng	Tom is beyond help.
3726136	eng	I refuse to help.
3726149	eng	My palms are damp.
3726150	eng	We hit a bump.
3726153	eng	I'm an undercover cop.
3726160	eng	I heard Tom gasp.
3726161	eng	Tom heard Mary gasp.
3726164	eng	You're all washed up.
3726184	eng	Tom is standing up.
3726190	eng	I'll screw everything up.
3726194	eng	We're not splitting up.
3726197	eng	We better wash up.
3726202	eng	OK people, listen up.
3726208	eng	You screwed this up.
3726212	eng	We're three floors up.
3726231	eng	They'll cheer you up.
3726232	eng	They'll put you up.
3726263	eng	The rules are clear.
3726266	eng	The law is clear.
3726267	eng	I know you're near.
3726273	eng	That was last year.
3726287	eng	You seem really familiar.
3726288	eng	That was pretty peculiar.
3726290	eng	This is very irregular.
3726296	eng	That's what I remember.
3726298	eng	It's hard to remember.
3726299	eng	Just take a number.
3726303	eng	The mood is sober.
3726319	eng	It's a special order.
3726323	eng	Everything looks in order.
3726325	eng	We're awaiting your order.
3726329	eng	We're investigating a murder.
3726341	eng	I couldn't be prouder.
3726349	eng	We hit a deer.
3726354	eng	I appreciate the offer.
3726436	eng	Tom's life's in danger.
3726444	eng	We're in no danger.
3726447	eng	You're in great danger.
3726453	eng	I'm only the messenger.
3726455	eng	Tom lost a finger.
3726465	eng	I've never felt stronger.
3726482	eng	Tom embraced his father.
3726487	eng	Get your life together.
3726489	eng	We'll all die together.
3726492	eng	Now pull yourself together.
3726499	eng	We'll solve this together.
3726501	eng	It'll keep us together.
3726503	eng	We'll solve it together.
3726517	eng	We dig each other.
3726540	eng	I'm not a stalker.
3726548	eng	I'm an excellent listener.
3726550	eng	This one's a no-brainer.
3726551	eng	That's quite a shiner.
3726556	eng	Tell me over dinner.
3726560	eng	We should get dinner.
3726564	eng	I have a prisoner.
3726575	eng	I've canceled the fundraiser.
3726580	eng	It'll make sense later.
3726589	eng	Catch you guys later.
3726607	eng	Tom's pulse beat faster.
3726617	eng	Well, I've had better.
3726629	eng	Well, I've been better.
3726636	eng	I've never slept better.
3726644	eng	It's only a computer.
3726660	eng	It'll never be over.
3726663	eng	Thank goodness that's over.
3726669	eng	This interview is over.
3726670	eng	Dinner is almost over.
3726673	eng	Everyone ran for cover.
3726675	eng	Tom needs to recover.
3726685	eng	Tom wants an answer.
3726742	eng	Tom was a sailor.
3726745	eng	It was an honor.
3726767	eng	Get on the floor.
3726778	eng	You're one savvy negotiator.
3726779	eng	Get me a defibrillator.
3726783	eng	Get me another doctor.
3726786	eng	Tom has a visitor.
3726792	eng	You've got one hour.
3726799	eng	The choice was Tom's.
3726801	eng	I have several ideas.
3726804	eng	Fruit gives me gas.
3726814	eng	They'll find us jobs.
3726815	eng	Tom changed his tactics.
3726897	eng	You have things backwards.
3726913	eng	There are no guarantees.
3726914	eng	They've been gone ages.
3726927	eng	We have extra toothbrushes.
3726935	eng	I offer my apologies.
3726937	eng	I need more supplies.
3726943	eng	Hardly anyone even tries.
3726946	eng	Think of the possibilities.
3726956	eng	You're losing your marbles.
3726958	eng	I don't like needles.
3726959	eng	Tom lighted his candles.
3726973	eng	I can name names.
3726974	eng	I need their names.
3726976	eng	Get with the times.
3726982	eng	I do pray sometimes.
3726984	eng	Fire up the engines.
3727006	eng	Tom, hold your horses.
3727011	eng	I'm done making excuses.
3727023	eng	It saved our lives.
3727028	eng	I appreciate your motives.
3727040	eng	Shoot anything that moves.
3727042	eng	I paid my taxes.
3727052	eng	Look at those legs.
3727053	eng	You have great legs.
3727063	eng	Perhaps you overthink things.
3727069	eng	You revealed your feelings.
3727100	eng	Look, I need this.
3727101	eng	Nobody could've planned this.
3727106	eng	Wait'll you see this.
3727119	eng	I can settle this.
3727122	eng	Tom doesn't deserve this.
3727171	eng	You'll hardly feel this.
3727178	eng	Sorry about all this.
3727187	eng	We're together in this.
3727208	eng	Let's just do this.
3727214	eng	There's nothing to this.
3727320	eng	Tom showed his credentials.
3727322	eng	We're spinning our wheels.
3727340	eng	Tell me your problems.
3727343	eng	They're in separate rooms.
3727351	eng	Tom heard the drums.
3727365	eng	I've got varicose veins.
3727367	eng	I've had my suspicions.
3727374	eng	We'd better make preparations.
3727381	eng	Stand by for instructions.
3727388	eng	We value your suggestions.
3727389	eng	Tom kindly answered questions.
3727396	eng	We're not taking questions.
3727404	eng	I have no weapons.
3727407	eng	We're playing for keeps.
3727421	eng	They are all ears.
3727432	eng	That could take years.
3727433	eng	It might take years.
3727451	eng	People die in wars.
3727458	eng	I had my orders.
3727472	eng	My sons are soldiers.
3727476	eng	They were contract killers.
3727480	eng	It's just good manners.
3727483	eng	We aren't the murderers.
3727496	eng	I just want answers.
3727504	eng	I need you upstairs.
3727518	eng	I'm guessing it's yours.
3727519	eng	The decision is yours.
3727521	eng	The victory is yours.
3727535	eng	Tom couldn't care less.
3727539	eng	This may be hopeless.
3727541	eng	We'll be totally defenseless.
3727545	eng	Tom is quite helpless.
3727548	eng	The floor is spotless.
3727549	eng	You look a mess.
3727552	eng	It's a legitimate business.
3727559	eng	You're an unreliable witness.
3727560	eng	Text me the address.
3727562	eng	Tom began to undress.
3727576	eng	That was my guess.
3727584	eng	Tom must've been suspicious.
3727595	eng	Tom waived his rights.
3727599	eng	I have my limits.
3727605	eng	Pull up your pants.
3727610	eng	You have hidden talents.
3727612	eng	They both gave statements.
3727623	eng	I call the shots.
3727624	eng	Tom calls the shots.
3727626	eng	They're all in cahoots.
3727633	eng	You're frightening the guests.
3727636	eng	No such person exists.
3727651	eng	You may leave us.
3727670	eng	You'll ride with us.
3727678	eng	They can't kill us.
3727685	eng	They've turned on us.
3727686	eng	They're gaining on us.
3727691	eng	They'll come to us.
3727696	eng	They're coming after us.
3727699	eng	They'll come for us.
3727752	eng	This isn't about us.
3727757	eng	Tom can barely focus.
3727760	eng	Tom was amazingly courageous.
3727762	eng	I can be courteous.
3727769	eng	You think we're serious.
3727770	eng	They're kind of serious.
3727773	eng	You're so very serious.
3727774	eng	That should be obvious.
3727775	eng	It seemed fairly obvious.
3727783	eng	It's becoming too dangerous.
3727784	eng	It's far too dangerous.
3727785	eng	It's way too dangerous.
3727787	eng	It was incredibly dangerous.
3727791	eng	The climb was strenuous.
3727792	eng	It's a little presumptuous.
3727794	eng	Outsiders make Tom nervous.
3727802	eng	Tell me the news.
3727805	eng	This is stunning news.
3727807	eng	I have marvelous news.
3727833	eng	Tom was sneered at.
3727844	eng	I'm not a deadbeat.
3727848	eng	This is working great.
3727853	eng	The chicken was great.
3727854	eng	Saving lives feels great.
3727856	eng	It feels pretty great.
3727872	eng	It can't be that.
3727873	eng	Anyone could see that.
3727878	eng	I can arrange that.
3727886	eng	It was like that.
3727889	eng	We aren't like that.
3727890	eng	They aren't like that.
3727897	eng	I can appreciate that.
3727905	eng	That's enough of that.
3727921	eng	I'm comfortable with that.
3727924	eng	Stop playing with that.
3727930	eng	I can feel that.
3727935	eng	Try telling Tom that.
3727954	eng	You're better than that.
3727957	eng	I insist on that.
3727958	eng	Tom would do that.
3727977	eng	I saw to that.
3727979	eng	I can top that.
3727987	eng	I can answer that.
3728000	eng	Everybody tells themselves that.
3728003	eng	I can respect that.
3728004	eng	I totally get that.
3728009	eng	Let's see about that.
3728019	eng	I'll worry about that.
3728026	eng	Look, I know that.
3728027	eng	I should know that.
3728042	eng	Have a little respect.
3728043	eng	Show a little respect.
3728046	eng	I'm not a suspect.
3728048	eng	They were very strict.
3728049	eng	Go with your instinct.
3728052	eng	I've got cold feet.
3728053	eng	Tom shifted his feet.
3728070	eng	It's almost too quiet.
3728071	eng	The floor is quiet.
3728074	eng	I chartered a jet.
3728075	eng	I'll take the jacket.
3728077	eng	Tom removed his jacket.
3728082	eng	Stock prices could skyrocket.
3728085	eng	Let's see your wallet.
3728088	eng	That's how we met.
3728117	eng	Tom nodded and left.
3728125	eng	I'll take first shift.
3728126	eng	I get your drift.
3728140	eng	Step into the light.
3728185	eng	I'm on your flight.
3728191	eng	It's a school night.
3728215	eng	I'm done for tonight.
3728229	eng	That's quite all right.
3728230	eng	Just pray I'm right.
3728242	eng	Tom came in sight.
3728255	eng	That's a nice thought.
3728259	eng	OK, hold that thought.
3728260	eng	That's an ugly thought.
3728266	eng	Nobody could've guessed it.
3728269	eng	I've already accepted it.
3728284	eng	Tom couldn't face it.
3728289	eng	You'll never see it.
3728290	eng	They can't see it.
3728296	eng	You'll never make it.
3728301	eng	Tom didn't dislike it.
3728303	eng	Now you've done it.
3728304	eng	I said ignore it.
3728323	eng	Don't think of it.
3728345	eng	You're not getting it.
3728362	eng	I'll run with it.
3728374	eng	That could explain it.
3728389	eng	This should do it.
3728406	eng	Let's get to it.
3728408	eng	I saw to it.
3728417	eng	They'll get over it.
3728418	eng	I'm completely over it.
3728420	eng	We paid for it.
3728428	eng	I suppose that's it.
3728436	eng	Let me inspect it.
3728445	eng	That's certainly not it.
3728472	eng	Don't fret about it.
3728487	eng	You're welcome to wait.
3728489	eng	I could hardly wait.
3728502	eng	They've upped my limit.
3728505	eng	I admire your grit.
3728514	eng	You made that difficult.
3728515	eng	I'm practically an adult.
3728530	eng	I know what's relevant.
3728533	eng	Believe anything you want.
3728554	eng	It's a little inconvenient.
3728561	eng	The crowd fell silent.
3728563	eng	Your paper was excellent.
3728565	eng	They're not all violent.
3728573	eng	Use your best judgment.
3728575	eng	They're in their element.
3728629	eng	It's a lifetime commitment.
3728630	eng	It's a serious commitment.
3728631	eng	It's a lifetime appointment.
3728647	eng	Tom's priorities are different.
3728651	eng	This time it's different.
3728653	eng	It was totally different.
3728655	eng	Tom will never consent.
3728663	eng	That's my whole point.
3728667	eng	That's the exact amount.
3728673	eng	It's a little hot.
3728674	eng	Tom was getting hot.
3728682	eng	Take your best shot.
3728686	eng	I've been an idiot.
3728704	eng	Tom began to shoot.
3728708	eng	It's hard to accept.
3728723	eng	That's my favorite part.
3728724	eng	That's the tough part.
3728726	eng	That's the hardest part.
3728727	eng	That's the worst part.
3728729	eng	That's the scary part.
3728730	eng	I'm not falling apart.
3728742	eng	Go to yellow alert.
3728745	eng	That's a real comfort.
3728747	eng	We've confirmed the report.
3728756	eng	It more than hurt.
3728783	eng	I can be honest.
3728784	eng	Tom was completely honest.
3728793	eng	I have one request.
3728794	eng	Tom clenched his fist.
3728799	eng	Tom's eyes were moist.
3728801	eng	It's hard to resist.
3728824	eng	The buyer backed out.
3728840	eng	They forced me out.
3728841	eng	It's freaking me out.
3728845	eng	It creeps me out.
3728847	eng	The boys are out.
3728849	eng	Tom stretched himself out.
3728850	eng	I'll show myself out.
3728852	eng	I'm not freaking out.
3728858	eng	I'm not moving out.
3728860	eng	I didn't sneak out.
3728879	eng	I never go out.
3728882	eng	We'll talk this out.
3728915	eng	I could be next.
3728923	eng	I really liked you.
3728953	eng	That's so unlike you.
3728959	eng	This may surprise you.
3728960	eng	We can accommodate you.
3728969	eng	I can drive you.
3728978	eng	I'm one of you.
3729051	eng	We sympathize with you.
3729080	eng	I could kill you.
3729101	eng	I'm happier than you.
3729106	eng	Let me entertain you.
3729152	eng	I must help you.
3729164	eng	That's gratitude for you.
3729188	eng	They're just for you.
3729194	eng	I could tutor you.
3729205	eng	I'm surprised at you.
3729223	eng	I almost shot you.
3729230	eng	It can't hurt you.
3729265	eng	It's against the law.
3729272	eng	Tom bowed and withdrew.
3729284	eng	It's our only show.
3729286	eng	Keep your head low.
3729289	eng	Leave this area now.
3729292	eng	That's all changed now.
3729339	eng	Let's do this now.
3729344	eng	The machine's yours now.
3729378	eng	Tom is alright now.
3729382	eng	It's so different now.
3729428	eng	I don't rightly know.
3729429	eng	The path was narrow.
3729434	eng	We'll begin rehearsals tomorrow.
3729544	eng	It's your special day.
3729545	eng	Today's your special day.
3729550	eng	It's a gorgeous day.
3729551	eng	It's a great day.
3729556	eng	It's your lucky day.
3729557	eng	Today's your lucky day.
3729571	eng	Tom's trial started today.
3729585	eng	That's plenty for today.
3729592	eng	I feel different today.
3729593	eng	I feel funny today.
3729603	eng	This is child's play.
3729608	eng	Maybe we should pray.
3729609	eng	Tom began to pray.
3729610	eng	It's just pepper spray.
3729629	eng	It's as you say.
3729637	eng	I can't possibly stay.
3729640	eng	It's on the way.
3729651	eng	They're headed this way.
3729656	eng	It's on its way.
3729683	eng	The laughter died away.
3729686	eng	They'll take me away.
3729687	eng	You'll give me away.
3729690	eng	You'll give yourself away.
3729704	eng	Tom wouldn't go away.
3729705	eng	I said step away.
3729717	eng	Get on the freeway.
3729734	eng	I'm at your mercy.
3729744	eng	It'll come in handy.
3729746	eng	Keep your gun handy.
3729749	eng	You could've killed somebody.
3729750	eng	Tom has got nobody.
3729751	eng	I never murdered anybody.
3729753	eng	It could be anybody.
3729759	eng	Tom didn't visit anybody.
3729791	eng	We make great money.
3729793	eng	Not everything's about money.
3729810	eng	I'll tell you why.
3729836	eng	That would seem likely.
3729852	eng	I've forgotten Tom completely.
3729867	eng	This might get ugly.
3729868	eng	It might get ugly.
3729869	eng	This just got ugly.
3729875	eng	Think about your family.
3729888	eng	Tom got up quickly.
3729893	eng	Tom was laughing hysterically.
3729897	eng	Don't take this personally.
3729912	eng	The door opened suddenly.
3729919	eng	I came in early.
3729926	eng	You'll enjoy it tremendously.
3729987	eng	That's my point exactly.
3729991	eng	Tom spoke very quietly.
3730008	eng	Tom's smile vanished instantly.
3730022	eng	You look positively ghastly.
3730023	eng	The door closed slowly.
3730033	eng	There are so many.
3730038	eng	You control your destiny.
3730043	eng	Tom is real funny.
3730046	eng	Tom recanted his testimony.
3730051	eng	Tom was getting sleepy.
3730055	eng	Tom wasn't quite happy.
3730069	eng	Tom could see Mary.
3730079	eng	Tom sat facing Mary.
3730148	eng	Tom opened the diary.
3730151	eng	Tom is a visionary.
3730155	eng	It's not brain surgery.
3730163	eng	That's quite a theory.
3730167	eng	This is dangerous territory.
3730173	eng	That's a different story.
3730195	eng	I felt very uneasy.
3730196	eng	It's a bit flimsy.
3730197	eng	People are getting antsy.
3730207	eng	Everyone is getting fidgety.
3730209	eng	You're a big softy.
3730214	eng	It's a huge responsibility.
3730218	eng	Have a little dignity.
3730221	eng	It's a remarkable opportunity.
3730231	eng	I admire their ingenuity.
3730238	eng	The roads were empty.
3730239	eng	Tom's cup was empty.
3730259	eng	I'm reporting for duty.
3730276	eng	My parents are crazy.
3730289	eng	Let me finish, OK?
3730296	eng	Why all the drama?
3730299	eng	Are we getting pizza?
3730303	eng	Aren't you the romantic?
3730304	eng	Should I feel bad?
3730308	eng	Why aren't you dead?
3730323	eng	What have I misspelled?
3730334	eng	Where was Tom imprisoned?
3730337	eng	How are you connected?
3730339	eng	Were you even tempted?
3730342	eng	Where are you posted?
3730349	eng	Are you that stupid?
3730359	eng	How should I respond?
3730360	eng	How do I respond?
3730368	eng	What's the magic word?
3730378	eng	What might that be?
3730404	eng	Is this Tom's residence?
3730415	eng	What's with the luggage?
3730464	eng	Tom's dangerous, isn't he?
3730474	eng	Who produced this movie?
3730477	eng	So what's it like?
3730482	eng	Is there a timetable?
3730497	eng	Where are your people?
3730504	eng	How'd you find me?
3730513	eng	Are you blackmailing me?
3730517	eng	Are you imitating me?
3730535	eng	Can you skip me?
3730560	eng	What's your pre-tax income?
3730561	eng	What was the outcome?
3730568	eng	What's the bottom line?
3730573	eng	Could you kill someone?
3730575	eng	Are you on dope?
3730582	eng	Why should I interfere?
3730586	eng	Why is anyone here?
3730596	eng	What's the deal here?
3730609	eng	What's this right here?
3730610	eng	Are you almost here?
3730626	eng	Is this place secure?
3730629	eng	Now are you sure?
3730639	eng	Did you paint these?
3730640	eng	Does that seem wise?
3730647	eng	What was the use?
3730653	eng	How's the blue plate?
3730661	eng	What will that achieve?
3730669	eng	Why can't I move?
3730670	eng	What did that prove?
3730682	eng	What tipped you off?
3730694	eng	Why are you flinching?
3730698	eng	Wouldn't that be something?
3730717	eng	Did we miss anything?
3730718	eng	Did we forget anything?
3730721	eng	Is that thing working?
3730722	eng	How are you dealing?
3730732	eng	How's married life going?
3730733	eng	How've you been keeping?
3730735	eng	Why isn't Tom stopping?
3730737	eng	What's that your wearing?
3730741	eng	Who am I addressing?
3730744	eng	Who does your decorating?
3730746	eng	Who am I forgetting?
3730751	eng	So what're you saying?
3730758	eng	Do you mind much?
3730762	eng	Why would I laugh?
3730779	eng	Are you on crack?
3730780	eng	What do you seek?
3730891	eng	Why take that risk?
3730893	eng	Now what's the deal?
3730908	eng	How can we tell?
3730914	eng	Isn't this simply beautiful?
3730923	eng	Did you question them?
3731086	eng	Can I question Tom?
3731108	eng	Did you kidnap Tom?
3731141	eng	Did someone contact Tom?
3731147	eng	How'd you meet Tom?
3731176	eng	What's with the broom?
3731184	eng	Where's this coming from?
3731185	eng	Where's that coming from?
3731186	eng	What tripped the alarm?
3731188	eng	Do I detect sarcasm?
3731189	eng	See what I mean?
3731193	eng	How's your morning been?
3731218	eng	Are you settling in?
3731228	eng	Where shall we begin?
3731235	eng	So what's going on?
3731238	eng	Need I go on?
3731239	eng	Am I under suspicion?
3731248	eng	Have you considered amputation?
3731266	eng	When was Tom born?
3731269	eng	Why haven't we begun?
3731274	eng	What shall I do?
3731338	eng	Any improvement is good.
3731346	eng	You've stalled the engine.
3731355	eng	That's not an issue.
3731367	eng	Smoking harms your health.
3731384	eng	Tom was captured again.
3731388	eng	Tom eventually left Boston.
3731393	eng	Tom pulled himself together.
3731407	eng	Tom keeps the books.
3731427	eng	Today is tomorrow's yesterday.
3731442	eng	Can I ask who?
3731449	eng	Is the water deep?
3731466	eng	Why can't I hear?
3731471	eng	I've studied French, remember?
3731475	eng	Anybody want a beer?
3731485	eng	What could be easier?
3731489	eng	Are you having dinner?
3731502	eng	My, aren't you clever?
3731504	eng	Would that be fair?
3731505	eng	How is this fair?
3731507	eng	What's with your hair?
3731512	eng	What's this vaccine for?
3731526	eng	How weird that was?
3731530	eng	What were the circumstances?
3731539	eng	What's with the candles?
3731546	eng	Are you taking minutes?
3731547	eng	What are your values?
3731548	eng	Shouldn't you wear gloves?
3731564	eng	Do you see this?
3731571	eng	Why tell me this?
3731610	eng	Do you carry weapons?
3731612	eng	Where are those prisoners?
3731647	eng	Did you volunteer us?
3731653	eng	What's all the ruckus?
3731664	eng	Isn't life just great?
3731677	eng	Do you realize that?
3731701	eng	How weird is that?
3731702	eng	How awesome is that?
3731729	eng	Aren't you dressed yet?
3731803	eng	It's over now, right?
3731805	eng	Does that feel right?
3731808	eng	Have you confirmed it?
3731812	eng	How'd you find it?
3731817	eng	Did you take it?
3731823	eng	How's Tom taking it?
3731838	eng	Would you drop it?
3731845	eng	How accurate is it?
3731846	eng	How special is it?
3731859	eng	Who could forget it?
3731861	eng	Did I blow it?
3731864	eng	What's with the outfit?
3731865	eng	How is that significant?
3731866	eng	Wouldn't that be redundant?
3731881	eng	How come we're different?
3731884	eng	Is there a point?
3731887	eng	What have we got?
3731897	eng	Can I be honest?
3731898	eng	May I be honest?
3731902	eng	Are you the pathologist?
3731903	eng	Are you a seismologist?
3731904	eng	Are you a paleontologist?
3731909	eng	Are you freaking out?
3731911	eng	How'd it work out?
3731912	eng	Would you chill out?
3731913	eng	Which way is out?
3731924	eng	Have they spotted you?
3731937	eng	Just who are you?
3731938	eng	Does Tom scare you?
3731943	eng	Is that bothering you?
3731950	eng	Did I ask you?
3731981	eng	What's got into you?
3732004	eng	Will this satisfy you?
3732005	eng	Does that satisfy you?
3732021	eng	Why wait until now?
3732030	eng	It's incredible, you know?
3732031	eng	How could you know?
3732043	eng	Why should anyone pay?
3732045	eng	What's there to say?
3732049	eng	What gave me away?
3732052	eng	What gave it away?
3732059	eng	Is the house ready?
3732066	eng	Can I ask why?
3732074	eng	Are you here voluntarily?
3732075	eng	Are you speaking metaphorically?
3732082	eng	Have you considered therapy?
3732094	eng	What's the whole story?
3732138	eng	What a disgusting idea!
3732139	eng	What an excellent idea!
3732140	eng	What a big cake!
3732141	eng	What a charming couple!
3732142	eng	What a lovely morning!
3732145	eng	What a beautiful room!
3732146	eng	What an odd expression!
3732148	eng	What an awful mess!
3732150	eng	What a wonderful sight!
3732172	eng	That would've been OK.
3732186	eng	That's an interesting idea.
3732201	eng	Tom forgot his umbrella.
3732202	eng	I'll take my umbrella.
3732230	eng	We're stuck in traffic.
3732236	eng	Tom was a fanatic.
3732237	eng	It was incredibly romantic.
3732241	eng	I feel quite bad.
3732244	eng	I still feel bad.
3732245	eng	Tom wasn't so bad.
3732246	eng	It wasn't so bad.
3732249	eng	The batteries are dead.
3732250	eng	These batteries are dead.
3732252	eng	Almost everyone was dead.
3732253	eng	The microphone is dead.
3732254	eng	They're probably already dead.
3732274	eng	I'm ready for bed.
3732288	eng	The ceremony has ended.
3732297	eng	They've all been paged.
3732300	eng	It can't be changed.
3732305	eng	My computer has crashed.
3732308	eng	It's not quite finished.
3732320	eng	Your request is denied.
3732331	eng	Perhaps Tom is married.
3732338	eng	Everybody else looks worried.
3732340	eng	Your door was unlocked.
3732366	eng	This conversation never happened.
3732392	eng	My clock has stopped.
3732400	eng	Tom might've been murdered.
3732401	eng	Tom never fully recovered.
3732412	eng	Tom might be tired.
3732414	eng	They said they're tired.
3732415	eng	Tom didn't feel tired.
3732423	eng	Tom felt very tired.
3732424	eng	Tom was pretty tired.
3732428	eng	Tom looked very pleased.
3732434	eng	The gates were closed.
3732436	eng	The shop was closed.
3732438	eng	The deadline has passed.
3732442	eng	Tom went home depressed.
3732444	eng	The kids are impressed.
3732445	eng	The kids weren't impressed.
3732450	eng	The kids look confused.
3732452	eng	Everyone's a bit confused.
3732453	eng	I was totally confused.
3732454	eng	Tom was utterly confused.
3732455	eng	My curiosity was aroused.
3732456	eng	It's a little complicated.
3732459	eng	Everyone's life is complicated.
3732465	eng	That cut looks infected.
3732471	eng	Tom must be protected.
3732492	eng	Tom might've been disappointed.
3732493	eng	Tom seemed somewhat disappointed.
3732498	eng	The room was deserted.
3732499	eng	The street is deserted.
3732501	eng	I finally feel rested.
3732511	eng	They said they're exhausted.
3732520	eng	I wouldn't get involved.
3732527	eng	We'll be well paid.
3732528	eng	They'll be well paid.
3732577	eng	I think you're stupid.
3732580	eng	Tom is incredibly stupid.
3732582	eng	The audience went wild.
3732584	eng	Tom looked very old.
3732587	eng	It felt very cold.
3732598	eng	Tom didn't quite understand.
3732602	eng	Tom was Mary's friend.
3732620	eng	Tom was very kind.
3732634	eng	I hate that sound.
3732642	eng	I like junk food.
3732652	eng	This better be good.
3732663	eng	No one else understood.
3732664	eng	I think you've misunderstood.
3732665	eng	I think you misunderstood.
3732670	eng	This shouldn't be hard.
3732673	eng	This really isn't hard.
3732684	eng	This is really awkward.
3732689	eng	Everyone thinks I'm weird.
3732698	eng	Look at Tom's face.
3732699	eng	Tom stole the necklace.
3732704	eng	Tom stared into space.
3732705	eng	It was a disgrace.
3732712	eng	I called the police.
3732719	eng	You do look nice.
3732721	eng	Everyone's been really nice.
3732743	eng	Now is your chance.
3732747	eng	Tom has no inheritance.
3732749	eng	That's quite a coincidence.
3732752	eng	It could be coincidence.
3732753	eng	I climbed the fence.
3732758	eng	Please don't lose patience.
3732759	eng	There was total silence.
3732776	eng	Please go back inside.
3732783	eng	We'll meet you outside.
3732791	eng	I scraped my knee.
3732792	eng	I hurt my knee.
3732794	eng	Tom never would agree.
3732795	eng	Tom might not agree.
3732796	eng	I hope you agree.
3732797	eng	I have to disagree.
3732800	eng	Try it and see.
3732815	eng	I'll tell my wife.
3732830	eng	Tom counted the change.
3732831	eng	Tom counted his change.
3732832	eng	Weather conditions may change.
3732833	eng	You guys are strange.
3732834	eng	It was rather strange.
3732836	eng	This is really strange.
3732837	eng	It was awfully strange.
3732838	eng	It was very strange.
3732839	eng	It was a challenge.
3732847	eng	That wasn't a lie.
3732849	eng	Take off your tie.
3732852	eng	They're making a movie.
3732864	eng	Have some birthday cake.
3732876	eng	It's an understandable mistake.
3732882	eng	That's what I like.
3732883	eng	Pick anything you like.
3732884	eng	Take what you like.
3732889	eng	Tom's voice is unmistakable.
3732891	eng	This price is reasonable.
3732894	eng	Your kids are adorable.
3732904	eng	You're making Tom uncomfortable.
3732908	eng	It really is unbelievable.
3732909	eng	It was really incredible.
3732910	eng	It was pretty incredible.
3732912	eng	It would've been possible.
3732918	eng	That might be impossible.
3732919	eng	It's always been impossible.
3732922	eng	This smells like trouble.
3732923	eng	That smells like trouble.
3732926	eng	Now we're in trouble.
3732927	eng	Don't get into trouble.
3732928	eng	You're in for trouble.
3732955	eng	It's basically quite simple.
3732956	eng	That would've been simple.
3732957	eng	Life isn't always simple.
3732972	eng	My friends encouraged me.
3732975	eng	Tom's behavior infuriated me.
3732983	eng	Tom was like me.
3732990	eng	You're not like me.
3732991	eng	That doesn't trouble me.
3732999	eng	Thanks for rescuing me.
3733000	eng	Tom danced with me.
3733005	eng	Tom was with me.
3733009	eng	Come on, tell me.
3733016	eng	The joke's on me.
3733019	eng	That doesn't concern me.
3733051	eng	Tom works for me.
3733059	eng	Everyone's looking at me.
3733060	eng	They're shooting at me.
3733067	eng	Tom could hurt me.
3733072	eng	Don't start without me.
3733077	eng	No one ever came.
3733078	eng	They're playing a game.
3733083	eng	That's an unusual name.
3733150	eng	I should've stayed home.
3733154	eng	Tom has gone home.
3733162	eng	They've taken Tom home.
3733189	eng	Give me that cane.
3733192	eng	We should be fine.
3733201	eng	Tom chose the wine.
3733204	eng	We knew no one.
3733207	eng	Look at that one.
3733224	eng	It couldn't be done.
3733225	eng	Something must be done.
3733226	eng	This must be done.
3733238	eng	My keys are gone.
3733269	eng	Remember where we are.
3733283	eng	You're not needed here.
3733286	eng	Wait a second here.
3733287	eng	It's cold around here.
3733288	eng	Everything looks good here.
3733302	eng	We'll always be here.
3733304	eng	It must be here.
3733305	eng	There's a mistake here.
3733313	eng	Remember why you're here.
3733322	eng	I've done well here.
3733323	eng	Everyone is still here.
3733337	eng	Let's work together here.
3733352	eng	We're all right here.
3733354	eng	Something isn't right here.
3733357	eng	It's beautiful out here.
3733361	eng	Grass doesn't grow here.
3733363	eng	Everything is ready here.
3733365	eng	There isn't anybody here.
3733385	eng	It was still there.
3733387	eng	Tom might've been there.
3733389	eng	They're still in there.
3733390	eng	Let's park over there.
3733391	eng	Nobody else was there.
3733392	eng	I have friends there.
3733395	eng	We are almost there.
3733396	eng	There wasn't anybody there.
3733403	eng	It'll be crowded everywhere.
3733410	eng	Everything's just like before.
3733426	eng	I should've eaten more.
3733441	eng	There's no known cure.
3733442	eng	Tom was a failure.
3733451	eng	Tom is studying agriculture.
3733454	eng	Here's to the future.
3733458	eng	Leave a message, please.
3733470	eng	It was a surprise.
3733489	eng	This is utter nonsense.
3733491	eng	The situation is tense.
3733492	eng	Tom was very tense.
3733501	eng	Stupidity is no excuse.
3733539	eng	It was getting late.
3733553	eng	Tom likes peppermint chocolate.
3733561	eng	Just let me concentrate.
3733562	eng	Allow me to demonstrate.
3733567	eng	Tom isn't very polite.
3733568	eng	This stuff is dynamite.
3733570	eng	Tom read the note.
3733594	eng	Perhaps I should leave.
3733622	eng	Tom may be alive.
3733623	eng	The hostages are alive.
3733625	eng	I'm glad I'm alive.
3733629	eng	Tom let Mary drive.
3733633	eng	Good advice isn't expensive.
3733635	eng	It looks really expensive.
3733638	eng	This isn't exactly impressive.
3733641	eng	Tom is always secretive.
3733643	eng	They began to move.
3733659	eng	This is exciting stuff.
3733660	eng	This is powerful stuff.
3733682	eng	Get control of yourself.
3733691	eng	I've seen it myself.
3733696	eng	Tom enjoys playing golf.
3733697	eng	Everything's taken care of.
3733700	eng	Tom doesn't often beg.
3733702	eng	Tom went on reading.
3733707	eng	Don't be so demanding.
3733710	eng	Boston is worth seeing.
3733715	eng	You're not very encouraging.
3733717	eng	I couldn't help laughing.
3733719	eng	Tom's computer keeps crashing.
3733723	eng	It's the real thing.
3733730	eng	We might find something.
3733737	eng	Tom might've caught something.
3733749	eng	We don't need anything.
3733755	eng	Please ask me anything.
3733757	eng	I can memorize anything.
3733764	eng	They never do anything.
3733768	eng	I couldn't eat anything.
3733775	eng	Tom couldn't say anything.
3733787	eng	You can't do everything.
3733789	eng	I'll pay for everything.
3733793	eng	Tom has gone skiing.
3733794	eng	Your hands are shaking.
3733796	eng	I did some checking.
3733806	eng	The women stopped working.
3733811	eng	It was quite thrilling.
3733814	eng	I don't like swimming.
3733816	eng	There's a guard coming.
3733818	eng	Tell Tom I'm coming.
3733826	eng	No one was listening.
3733828	eng	Have a wonderful evening.
3733830	eng	I'll remember this evening.
3733859	eng	It was Tom's doing.
3733863	eng	Tom has gone camping.
3733873	eng	That was really boring.
3733878	eng	Prices have been rising.
3733885	eng	It was very amusing.
3733909	eng	It sounds very exciting.
3733911	eng	It should be interesting.
3733916	eng	It was very interesting.
3733918	eng	It was pretty disgusting.
3733919	eng	There's no use arguing.
3733929	eng	People are always dying.
3733933	eng	This is worth studying.
3733937	eng	The baby started crying.
3733940	eng	It was worth trying.
3733942	eng	Your family is amazing.
3733943	eng	It won't be long.
3733973	eng	It was all wrong.
3733974	eng	That was all wrong.
3733976	eng	It didn't seem wrong.
3733988	eng	I got married young.
3734004	eng	They both got rich.
3734010	eng	They don't understand French.
3734015	eng	I'm still studying French.
3734044	eng	Tom couldn't speak French.
3734049	eng	Tom spoke in French.
3734051	eng	Say it in French.
3734066	eng	We should've brought lunch.
3734069	eng	They didn't argue much.
3734076	eng	It was too much.
3734082	eng	Tom didn't eat much.
3734084	eng	That's a bit much.
3734085	eng	It wouldn't cost much.
3734095	eng	I'll keep in touch.
3734096	eng	It was extremely high.
3734097	eng	Everything made Tom laugh.
3734106	eng	This should be enough.
3734115	eng	Being rich isn't enough.
3734117	eng	Obedience is not enough.
3734118	eng	That sounds easy enough.
3734119	eng	Tom might pull through.
3734121	eng	This is Tom's photograph.
3734129	eng	Everybody held their breath.
3734138	eng	Tom died last month.
3734156	eng	The signal's very weak.
3734165	eng	I'll send it back.
3734166	eng	They all went back.
3734170	eng	I should go pack.
3734172	eng	Tom might be sick.
3734175	eng	Tom might get sick.
3734177	eng	Look at the clock.
3734185	eng	Tom came last week.
3734197	eng	Tom wanted to talk.
3734199	eng	It's time to talk.
3734204	eng	Tom doesn't like milk.
3734206	eng	Tom never drinks milk.
3734215	eng	Get me a drink.
3734223	eng	Tom is a monk.
3734224	eng	Tom might be drunk.
3734226	eng	Tom might've been drunk.
3734234	eng	It's an interesting book.
3734252	eng	They're refusing to work.
3734263	eng	The kids have homework.
3734271	eng	Everything's running like clockwork.
3734272	eng	I forgot to ask.
3734281	eng	It's a calculated risk.
3734282	eng	There's absolutely no risk.
3734286	eng	It's all perfectly legal.
3734288	eng	This is highly illegal.
3734289	eng	Tom's troubles weren't financial.
3734291	eng	Everything's returning to normal.
3734292	eng	Everything's back to normal.
3734293	eng	Everything looks pretty normal.
3734299	eng	This is rather unusual.
3734300	eng	This is highly unusual.
3734304	eng	I want to travel.
3734328	eng	I've been watching baseball.
3734335	eng	It was too small.
3734339	eng	You know me well.
3734341	eng	Tom has done well.
3734346	eng	I haven't been well.
3734349	eng	Tom didn't sleep well.
3734352	eng	Tom always eats well.
3734361	eng	Tom paid his bill.
3734371	eng	I've never skipped school.
3734392	eng	Tom is always careful.
3734394	eng	I've been very careful.
3734395	eng	We've been very careful.
3734397	eng	Tom was very careful.
3734398	eng	It might be useful.
3734404	eng	This is really helpful.
3734408	eng	The operation was successful.
3734409	eng	It was extremely stressful.
3734410	eng	Last summer was awful.
3734420	eng	I want to scream.
3734521	eng	I was quite calm.
3734531	eng	We all liked Tom.
3734536	eng	I've always admired Tom.
3734538	eng	We all hated Tom.
3734542	eng	We all loved Tom.
3734551	eng	We could see Tom.
3734565	eng	I can't forgive Tom.
3734575	eng	There's someone with Tom.
3734612	eng	You can ask Tom.
3734616	eng	That belonged to Tom.
3734622	eng	Take me to Tom.
3734624	eng	I'll write to Tom.
3734633	eng	I've written to Tom.
3734648	eng	I couldn't help Tom.
3734659	eng	Look out for Tom.
3734662	eng	No one likes Tom.
3734665	eng	We laughed at Tom.
3734670	eng	I've already met Tom.
3734685	eng	They all knew Tom.
3734686	eng	I may know Tom.
3734690	eng	Please leave the room.
3734699	eng	We have no room.
3734703	eng	Please leave this room.
3734738	eng	Tom knows I'm Canadian.
3734744	eng	Tom isn't a vegetarian.
3734751	eng	I have another plan.
3734754	eng	This is my plan.
3734782	eng	I wasn't alone then.
3734795	eng	The gate was open.
3734797	eng	Keep the windows open.
3734806	eng	That must never happen.
3734811	eng	We have three children.
3734824	eng	I had completely forgotten.
3734852	eng	I won't give in.
3734854	eng	Let's go on in.
3734857	eng	The verdict is in.
3734859	eng	They both laughed again.
3734860	eng	Tom has misbehaved again.
3734862	eng	Do it once again.
3734873	eng	The telephone rang again.
3734900	eng	It was quiet again.
3734905	eng	I'll do it again.
3734910	eng	It's tough to explain.
3734912	eng	It's difficult to explain.
3734920	eng	Tom pocketed the coin.
3734924	eng	Get a move on.
3734949	eng	That's an old-fashioned expression.
3734954	eng	It's a foregone conclusion.
3734967	eng	We explained the situation.
3734968	eng	Tom explained the situation.
3734969	eng	It's an impossible situation.
3734973	eng	Tom works in construction.
3734978	eng	Tom repeated the question.
3734981	eng	Don't ask that question.
3734984	eng	You've answered my question.
3734987	eng	We'll take every precaution.
3735006	eng	Tom'll be here soon.
3735007	eng	Tom might arrive soon.
3735008	eng	It'll start raining soon.
3735014	eng	I'll be thirty soon.
3735016	eng	Tom knew the reason.
3735017	eng	That's the true reason.
3735018	eng	That's the real reason.
3735030	eng	Tom wouldn't like Boston.
3735034	eng	Tom doesn't like Boston.
3735037	eng	I'll never leave Boston.
3735041	eng	It's located in Boston.
3735080	eng	Tom isn't in Boston.
3735121	eng	Don't be so stubborn.
3735123	eng	Now it's our turn.
3735129	eng	That would've been fun.
3735132	eng	It was great fun.
3735135	eng	Put down your gun.
3735136	eng	Tom fired his gun.
3735137	eng	Put down that gun.
3735138	eng	I slept till dawn.
3735146	eng	Put the rifle down.
3735149	eng	Prices are going down.
3735150	eng	We'll never back down.
3735151	eng	Please write that down.
3735152	eng	Tom wouldn't sit down.
3735159	eng	I'm going to town.
3735239	eng	I said I'd go.
3735246	eng	I've promised to go.
3735247	eng	Tom refused to go.
3735255	eng	We expect to go.
3735261	eng	Everything's ready to go.
3735272	eng	It was years ago.
3735286	eng	Let me come, too.
3735287	eng	You'd better come, too.
3735288	eng	My name's Tom, too.
3735291	eng	I thought so, too.
3735292	eng	I like dogs, too.
3735293	eng	I like that, too.
3735294	eng	Tom liked it, too.
3735295	eng	Show me your tattoo.
3735297	eng	That must be so.
3735298	eng	They told me so.
3735301	eng	I should think so.
3735324	eng	This water is deep.
3735333	eng	Tom looks half asleep.
3735335	eng	They're not all asleep.
3735336	eng	Everyone is still asleep.
3735340	eng	That was a help.
3735349	eng	Tom needs some help.
3735351	eng	Tom needs more help.
3735367	eng	You promised to help.
3735376	eng	They're trying to help.
3735403	eng	They all looked up.
3735405	eng	Get yourself cleaned up.
3735411	eng	I didn't give up.
3735414	eng	We'd better wash up.
3735417	eng	Everyone's pretty shaken up.
3735452	eng	Tom's voice was clear.
3735468	eng	It was quite spectacular.
3735472	eng	Don't touch my guitar.
3735490	eng	I should've studied harder.
3735501	eng	You must try harder.
3735502	eng	Everything seems in order.
3735503	eng	Give me some beer.
3735507	eng	Don't make me suffer.
3735510	eng	That's the new manager.
3735512	eng	We're really in danger.
3735513	eng	Pretend I'm a stranger.
3735522	eng	Tom didn't recognize her.
3735536	eng	I remember your father.
3735554	eng	They got drunk together.
3735561	eng	We hate each other.
3735570	eng	I know your brother.
3735572	eng	I should've started earlier.
3735573	eng	We should've started earlier.
3735574	eng	You should've started earlier.
3735578	eng	I should've quit earlier.
3735579	eng	We should've quit earlier.
3735580	eng	You should've quit earlier.
3735581	eng	Tom felt much happier.
3735595	eng	Tom bought a paper.
3735599	eng	Let's all have supper.
3735607	eng	Let me add water.
3735621	eng	There's nothing the matter.
3735622	eng	That's what's the matter.
3735623	eng	It's a confidential matter.
3735626	eng	It's a serious matter.
3735628	eng	You've made everything better.
3735635	eng	I like you better.
3735641	eng	I wrote that letter.
3735649	eng	The experiment is over.
3735650	eng	The evening isn't over.
3735653	eng	The show's almost over.
3735656	eng	Tom opened the drawer.
3735660	eng	I'm in the shower.
3735664	eng	There's only one answer.
3735671	eng	I'm your new lawyer.
3735673	eng	We must be fair.
3735676	eng	Tom cut my hair.
3735699	eng	There's no front door.
3735700	eng	I closed my door.
3735711	eng	Tom is a pastor.
3735712	eng	It took an hour.
3735713	eng	Let's wait an hour.
3735749	eng	You're in my hands.
3735751	eng	We're already good friends.
3735754	eng	Tom had many friends.
3735768	eng	They've seen our faces.
3735771	eng	There are no coincidences.
3735774	eng	They may have hostages.
3735783	eng	I don't like cranberries.
3735785	eng	Tom knows many celebrities.
3735787	eng	We'll have some difficulties.
3735797	eng	There aren't any rules.
3735800	eng	These received no names.
3735802	eng	They do that sometimes.
3735804	eng	They're the right ones.
3735815	eng	Take off your glasses.
3735821	eng	Let's stop fooling ourselves.
3735827	eng	Tom has good eyes.
3735831	eng	I opened my eyes.
3735840	eng	Tom had three dogs.
3735868	eng	Try to understand this.
3735872	eng	Tom didn't like this.
3735899	eng	Tom sent you this.
3735904	eng	Tom enjoys playing tennis.
3735905	eng	That's an interesting hypothesis.
3735923	eng	Look at the sharks.
3735934	eng	Hand over your firearms.
3735941	eng	Even chocolate contains vitamins.
3735944	eng	Don't feed the pigeons.
3735959	eng	Children like gummy bears.
3735969	eng	Look at the stars.
3735977	eng	Those men are soldiers.
3735982	eng	Wait for me downstairs.
3735988	eng	There are no survivors.
3736011	eng	I feel completely helpless.
3736013	eng	I can't stand rudeness.
3736014	eng	You don't understand business.
3736021	eng	It's a wild guess.
3736023	eng	That's our new boss.
3736029	eng	This area's off limits.
3736040	eng	Children imitate their parents.
3736047	eng	They didn't see us.
3736049	eng	Tom doesn't blame us.
3736056	eng	Thanks for inviting us.
3736092	eng	Tom was with us.
3736093	eng	Tom wasn't with us.
3736095	eng	Tom won't fail us.
3736122	eng	Tom cooks for us.
3736126	eng	Nobody really wants us.
3736127	eng	Everyone's looking at us.
3736132	eng	Everything smells so delicious.
3736143	eng	It made me furious.
3736144	eng	Tom is very cautious.
3736146	eng	This place is fabulous.
3736147	eng	I think that's ridiculous.
3736148	eng	This could be dangerous.
3736149	eng	Tom may be dangerous.
3736150	eng	Bears are quite dangerous.
3736151	eng	That man is dangerous.
3736152	eng	Bears are very dangerous.
3736158	eng	You're making Tom nervous.
3736159	eng	Tom seemed rather nervous.
3736160	eng	Tom felt very nervous.
3736163	eng	Here's some good news.
3736164	eng	We got the news.
3736187	eng	They weren't all boys.
3736189	eng	These are my boys.
3736202	eng	That would've been great.
3736203	eng	This coffee tastes great.
3736204	eng	This car runs great.
3736207	eng	I think I'm fat.
3736214	eng	We've already settled that.
3736222	eng	I can see that.
3736225	eng	It's always like that.
3736226	eng	Tom didn't like that.
3736227	eng	Tom wasn't like that.
3736233	eng	Tom hasn't done that.
3736234	eng	I'm glad of that.
3736236	eng	I've thought of that.
3736250	eng	They did mean that.
3736255	eng	Tom could explain that.
3736256	eng	I've always known that.
3736306	eng	We'll never do that.
3736328	eng	I can't forget that.
3736329	eng	I'll not forget that.
3736352	eng	They all say that.
3736356	eng	It wasn't only that.
3736357	eng	I won't deny that.
3736361	eng	Here's a fun fact.
3736365	eng	That wasn't my object.
3736372	eng	I acted on instinct.
3736380	eng	I'll just keep quiet.
3736381	eng	Everyone was very quiet.
3736382	eng	It was very quiet.
3736383	eng	It seemed pretty quiet.
3736390	eng	I'm glad we met.
3736393	eng	Actually, we've already met.
3736396	eng	Tom knew Mary's secret.
3736402	eng	Tom isn't married yet.
3736404	eng	I haven't shaved yet.
3736406	eng	Tom isn't awake yet.
3736423	eng	Tom isn't beaten yet.
3736430	eng	I'm not famous yet.
3736435	eng	I feel a draft.
3736441	eng	They're open till eight.
3736449	eng	Get up and fight.
3736452	eng	We're ready to fight.
3736453	eng	Tom can really fight.
3736454	eng	I saw the light.
3736456	eng	They worked all night.
3736475	eng	It was after midnight.
3736477	eng	Tom almost died tonight.
3736478	eng	Tom nearly died tonight.
3736489	eng	Everyone can't be right.
3736491	eng	It's not quite right.
3736495	eng	Well, that's all right.
3736496	eng	It didn't seem right.
3736500	eng	Perhaps Tom was right.
3736503	eng	What's right is right.
3736505	eng	You were actually right.
3736508	eng	Love can't be bought.
3736510	eng	There's a nice thought.
3736512	eng	We all noticed it.
3736515	eng	Tom just did it.
3736517	eng	I couldn't stand it.
3736518	eng	I couldn't understand it.
3736519	eng	Tom couldn't understand it.
3736521	eng	Tom couldn't find it.
3736525	eng	I've never heard it.
3736528	eng	Tom couldn't see it.
3736530	eng	We can take it.
3736534	eng	Tom wouldn't like it.
3736540	eng	I've heard of it.
3736544	eng	We're still discussing it.
3736547	eng	Tom didn't feel it.
3736548	eng	We have seen it.
3736550	eng	Someone will do it.
3736576	eng	We can't help it.
3736577	eng	You couldn't help it.
3736578	eng	I couldn't bear it.
3736579	eng	I do remember it.
3736581	eng	They're looking for it.
3736582	eng	They're waiting for it.
3736584	eng	Well, that explains it.
3736586	eng	Tom looked at it.
3736590	eng	I'll never forget it.
3736593	eng	Well, you'll regret it.
3736594	eng	Tom won't want it.
3736595	eng	Tom couldn't prevent it.
3736596	eng	I haven't got it.
3736603	eng	Don't talk about it.
3736604	eng	I thought about it.
3736611	eng	I couldn't deny it.
3736616	eng	Tom had to wait.
3736626	eng	That's your own fault.
3736627	eng	It's our own fault.
3736633	eng	That wasn't Tom's fault.
3736637	eng	That wasn't my fault.
3736639	eng	Tom did a somersault.
3736644	eng	It was extraordinarily difficult.
3736657	eng	This is more important.
3736662	eng	This test is important.
3736664	eng	Honesty is very important.
3736674	eng	I'm also a student.
3736676	eng	This should be sufficient.
3736682	eng	Tom has real talent.
3736687	eng	Just wait a moment.
3736699	eng	Your hair is different.
3736708	eng	I get your point.
3736713	eng	The room's getting hot.
3736714	eng	It was stiflingly hot.
3736742	eng	This is the spot.
3736745	eng	Here's the best part.
3736754	eng	Time is running short.
3736765	eng	I was too fast.
3736769	eng	I should've eaten breakfast.
3736770	eng	I often skip breakfast.
3736779	eng	I've done my best.
3736783	eng	Tell me the rest.
3736822	eng	The lights were out.
3736825	eng	This isn't working out.
3736826	eng	Thanks for helping out.
3736828	eng	Tom enjoys eating out.
3736829	eng	You'd better look out.
3736830	eng	Everything will work out.
3736831	eng	Tom looks worn out.
3736835	eng	The fire was out.
3736840	eng	There's another way out.
3736853	eng	I had a blackout.
3736855	eng	I've always admired you.
3736856	eng	We all missed you.
3736872	eng	Tom can advise you.
3736880	eng	I'm jealous of you.
3736882	eng	They're just using you.
3736908	eng	I'm richer than you.
3736910	eng	I've never forgotten you.
3736922	eng	Everybody listens to you.
3736926	eng	Nobody will help you.
3736934	eng	Tom might help you.
3736935	eng	This may help you.
3736938	eng	I'll look after you.
3736939	eng	I'll get over you.
3736942	eng	I'll send for you.
3736946	eng	Everyone's looking for you.
3736947	eng	Everybody's looking for you.
3736948	eng	Everyone's asking for you.
3736950	eng	Everybody's waiting for you.
3736965	eng	Nobody will hurt you.
3736976	eng	I can't repay you.
3736977	eng	I can't marry you.
3736987	eng	Watch from the window.
3736991	eng	We'll do it somehow.
3737001	eng	Everyone is watching now.
3737005	eng	You're my girl now.
3737009	eng	I'm a man now.
3737015	eng	There's no danger now.
3737016	eng	You'll feel better now.
3737018	eng	I'm done for now.
3737020	eng	I'm your boss now.
3737022	eng	Well, it's obvious now.
3737032	eng	We're all right now.
3737033	eng	Tom's all right now.
3737044	eng	We know it now.
3737045	eng	Everything is different now.
3737086	eng	It'll be ready tomorrow.
3737090	eng	Bring your tool box.
3737093	eng	Tomorrow is Father's Day.
3737105	eng	It's a hot day.
3737112	eng	You deserve a holiday.
3737138	eng	I feel fine today.
3737147	eng	Let's go there today.
3737162	eng	It's unusually warm today.
3737168	eng	Apples are cheap today.
3737171	eng	It's much warmer today.
3737182	eng	We saw them yesterday.
3737209	eng	That's easy to say.
3737210	eng	I've had my say.
3737219	eng	They've all moved away.
3737221	eng	They're not going away.
3737222	eng	I didn't run away.
3737224	eng	I'd better go away.
3737225	eng	Tom won't go away.
3737226	eng	I can't get away.
3737236	eng	Tom wants some privacy.
3737241	eng	I'm not quite ready.
3737242	eng	I'm still getting ready.
3737247	eng	Keep your weapons ready.
3737256	eng	You've said that already.
3737263	eng	It was quite windy.
3737268	eng	Tom's got the key.
3737296	eng	Stop spending my money.
3737299	eng	Have a pleasant journey.
3737300	eng	It was very stuffy.
3737303	eng	Tom was very shy.
3737308	eng	I can't understand why.
3737309	eng	I guess I'm lucky.
3737311	eng	Tom wasn't so lucky.
3737313	eng	That was very lucky.
3737318	eng	Tom might be lonely.
3737321	eng	I'm enjoying myself immensely.
3737324	eng	Take me home immediately.
3737325	eng	Leave the room immediately.
3737338	eng	It's from your family.
3737342	eng	The rumor spread quickly.
3737343	eng	The rumors spread quickly.
3737356	eng	Tom left school early.
3737359	eng	Everybody looked around nervously.
3737360	eng	Tom will understand perfectly.
3737363	eng	Tom was here recently.
3737364	eng	We underestimated the enemy.
3737369	eng	This room smells funny.
3737370	eng	I find that funny.
3737377	eng	Tom's a nice boy.
3737389	eng	They said they're happy.
3737392	eng	Apparently, everyone was happy.
3737395	eng	Tom felt extraordinarily happy.
3737396	eng	Tom wasn't really happy.
3737397	eng	Tom seemed fairly happy.
3737401	eng	Tom might be unhappy.
3737403	eng	You've made Tom unhappy.
3737405	eng	I was so unhappy.
3737411	eng	Tom must've misunderstood Mary.
3737420	eng	Tom didn't blame Mary.
3737456	eng	Tom sang to Mary.
3737484	eng	Tom almost caught Mary.
3737502	eng	It's almost our anniversary.
3737508	eng	Life is a mystery.
3737509	eng	Tom is a mystery.
3737515	eng	Tom went away angry.
3737516	eng	Tom might be hungry.
3737517	eng	They said they're hungry.
3737523	eng	Tom wasn't really hungry.
3737527	eng	It's a fantastic story.
3737530	eng	That's an interesting story.
3737535	eng	There was no hurry.
3737537	eng	Well, you'd better hurry.
3737542	eng	We'll let Tom try.
3737546	eng	It was too easy.
3737548	eng	Life is never easy.
3737550	eng	This work isn't easy.
3737555	eng	Tom won't be busy.
3737557	eng	They said they're busy.
3737560	eng	They're not all busy.
3737568	eng	Tom wasn't really busy.
3737575	eng	It's a wonderful opportunity.
3737576	eng	It was my opportunity.
3737579	eng	There's only one difficulty.
3737581	eng	The barn was empty.
3737582	eng	Tom's glass was empty.
3737583	eng	The box was empty.
3737584	eng	The classroom is empty.
3737586	eng	The box wasn't empty.
3737587	eng	The box isn't empty.
3737590	eng	I attended the party.
3737617	eng	It's a great party.
3737624	eng	Tom might be thirsty.
3737626	eng	They said they're thirsty.
3737629	eng	Your room looks pretty.
3737630	eng	Mary is extraordinarily pretty.
3737635	eng	They've all gone crazy.
3737636	eng	Sometimes I feel dizzy.
3737653	eng	So what's your dilemma?
3737674	eng	Are you almost finished?
3737676	eng	Is Tom still married?
3737679	eng	Was Tom ever married?
3737682	eng	Why wasn't I asked?
3737684	eng	Well, what's it called?
3737685	eng	Is everybody's mug filled?
3737690	eng	Why were they scared?
3737693	eng	Why is Tom tired?
3737694	eng	Why are you tired?
3737695	eng	Why aren't you tired?
3737697	eng	Were you really surprised?
3737698	eng	Why are you embarrassed?
3737702	eng	Have you been mistreated?
3737703	eng	Are you two related?
3737709	eng	Have you been arrested?
3737730	eng	Who's your best friend?
3737737	eng	Is that clearly understood?
3737739	eng	Can we be overheard?
3737743	eng	Who can that be?
3737745	eng	Who could it be?
3737747	eng	What can it be?
3737753	eng	Where's my apple juice?
3737756	eng	How was the dance?
3737759	eng	Do you require assistance?
3737762	eng	What's it like outside?
3737763	eng	Are you coming outside?
3737767	eng	Did you say three?
3737771	eng	Is that your wife?
3737777	eng	Is that your ex-wife?
3737780	eng	Who sent this message?
3737789	eng	Is Tom still awake?
3737794	eng	What is it like?
3737797	eng	Does anybody smell smoke?
3737798	eng	Do you feel responsible?
3737799	eng	Wouldn't that be irresponsible?
3737800	eng	How's that even possible?
3737805	eng	Is Tom still single?
3737808	eng	What's the golden rule?
3737810	eng	Can you see me?
3737815	eng	Were you addressing me?
3737816	eng	Weren't you expecting me?
3737823	eng	Have you forgiven me?
3737827	eng	Can't you help me?
3737838	eng	Do you follow me?
3737839	eng	Don't you know me?
3737840	eng	What's Tom's middle name?
3737848	eng	Why did Tom come?
3737853	eng	How's everything at home?
3737854	eng	Was Tom at home?
3737859	eng	Do you sell wine?
3737863	eng	What will be done?
3737864	eng	Why was it done?
3737865	eng	What've we just done?
3737875	eng	Who's in command here?
3737901	eng	Should we wait here?
3737903	eng	What brought you here?
3737915	eng	Are you heading somewhere?
3737917	eng	Have you looked everywhere?
3737921	eng	Are you quite sure?
3737922	eng	Are you really sure?
3737929	eng	Did you proofread these?
3737944	eng	Is that really appropriate?
3737954	eng	How can I leave?
3737967	eng	Is there no alternative?
3737972	eng	What's Tom's shoe size?
3737973	eng	Who was the thief?
3737993	eng	Why aren't you dancing?
3737995	eng	How's the spice pudding?
3738001	eng	Have you changed anything?
3738002	eng	Do you recognize anything?

3812610	eng	She doesn't read anything.
3812739	eng	She won't come today.
3813054	eng	The answer was easy.
3813111	eng	We need a timekeeper.
3813378	eng	That's an interesting study.
3813661	eng	What is the voltage?
3813702	eng	The door doesn't lock.
3814764	eng	His question puzzles me.
3814835	eng	They forgot my birthday.
3815009	eng	We continued to talk.
3815011	eng	Do not say "wait".
3815056	eng	Don't trust anyone here!
3815803	eng	Stop being a nuisance!
3815879	eng	Tom is my charge.
3815892	eng	I call myself “Tom”.
3815917	eng	I am Tom's custodian.
3816990	eng	She worked in Belgium.
3816997	eng	Do you know Persian?
3817961	eng	Tom came about 2:30.
3817972	eng	This is my fiancé.
3817990	eng	Can I borrow yours?
3817991	eng	Is this pen yours?
3817992	eng	Is this all yours?
3817993	eng	What's wrong with yours?
3817995	eng	Is this umbrella yours?
3818002	eng	Maybe you're too young.
3818021	eng	You're early, aren't you?
3818023	eng	You're curious, aren't you?
3818045	eng	What's important to you?
3818079	eng	Was someone helping you?
3818080	eng	Who's been watching you?
3818081	eng	Would they recognize you?
3818089	eng	Did I invite you?
3818090	eng	Did I surprise you?
3818102	eng	Have I embarrassed you?
3818118	eng	Let's talk about you.
3818132	eng	I really respect you.
3818134	eng	Look who beat you.
3818138	eng	Tonight, I'll miss you.
3818140	eng	The problem is you.
3818141	eng	Maybe Tom loves you.
3818142	eng	No one believes you.
3818165	eng	I'll cook for you.
3818179	eng	We'll look after you.
3818208	eng	We believe in you.
3818210	eng	Everyone believed in you.
3818211	eng	Tom hasn't forgotten you.
3818212	eng	I'm stronger than you.
3818218	eng	I'll never tell you.
3818231	eng	We're all with you.
3818241	eng	I'm angry at you.
3818250	eng	I'm tired of you.
3818253	eng	I'll never deceive you.
3818258	eng	Someone will save you.
3818269	eng	Not everyone's like you.
3818279	eng	I've finally found you.
3818282	eng	I've always liked you.
3818283	eng	I urgently need you.
3818292	eng	I'm not sleepy yet.
3818308	eng	We're not open yet.
3818325	eng	We're not free yet.
3818327	eng	I'm not convinced yet.
3818338	eng	Tom was busy yesterday.
3818339	eng	Tom was lucky yesterday.
3818343	eng	I told you yesterday.
3818344	eng	Tom was out yesterday.
3818348	eng	The surgery was yesterday.
3818350	eng	It was fun yesterday.
3818359	eng	I got married yesterday.
3818378	eng	I'll graduate this year.
3818401	eng	I guess I'm wrong.
3818412	eng	You've done something wrong.
3818413	eng	I've done something wrong.
3818417	eng	It seems well written.
3818419	eng	You're a great writer.
3818422	eng	Your shirt is wrinkled.
3818429	eng	You could do worse.
3818430	eng	It could've been worse.
3818437	eng	This is our world.
3818442	eng	I bet it works.
3818445	eng	I want to workout.
3818447	eng	It's not yet working.
3818448	eng	My plan is working.
3818449	eng	This time it worked.
3818450	eng	I'm glad that worked.
3818451	eng	How will it work?
3818453	eng	Did the dishwasher work?
3818464	eng	I've finished my work.
3818468	eng	This computer doesn't work.
3818494	eng	This picture is wonderful.
3818496	eng	Do you like women?
3818499	eng	Never interrupt a woman.
3818501	eng	Who were you with?
3818509	eng	What's your third wish?
3818510	eng	That's not very wise.
3818511	eng	Cut the red wire.
3818521	eng	I brought some wine.
3818525	eng	I washed the windows.
3818542	eng	Take off your wig.
3818546	eng	Would you explain why?
3818550	eng	Let's ask ourselves why.
3818560	eng	My shoes got wet.
3818574	eng	Did everyone sleep well?
3818575	eng	Did everything go well?
3818576	eng	Are you doing well?
3818579	eng	Are you paid well?
3818583	eng	Tom isn't very well.
3818591	eng	Tom's doing very well.
3818592	eng	I understood very well.
3818593	eng	They did very well.
3818594	eng	Tom did very well.
3818613	eng	Look into the well.
3818614	eng	They both did well.
3818615	eng	That job paid well.
3818617	eng	I'm not a weirdo.
3818619	eng	Your eyebrows look weird.
3818620	eng	Your ideas are weird.
3818656	eng	We needed this weather.
3818657	eng	This is unusual weather.
3818660	eng	What should we wear?
3818661	eng	Throw down your weapons.
3818667	eng	Tom went that way.
3818676	eng	I'll find a way.
3818677	eng	Don't drink this water.
3818708	eng	Tom left without warning.
3818740	eng	Think what you want.
3818753	eng	Where's your magic wand?
3818756	eng	I forgot my wallet.
3818762	eng	Can you still walk?
3818765	eng	Your friends are waiting.
3818766	eng	I wouldn't have waited.
3818772	eng	I'm sure you'll wait.
3818774	eng	It's worth the wait.
3818775	eng	This is a vowel.
3818779	eng	I want to vote.
3818782	eng	I've always liked volleyball.
3818783	eng	This is really volatile.
3818786	eng	Who asked for vodka?
3818787	eng	My parents are visiting.
3818792	eng	It's not a virus.
3818795	eng	Look at the view.
3818798	eng	I love this video.
3818800	eng	I saw the video.
3818801	eng	Congratulations on your victory.
3818803	eng	Do you like venison?
3818809	eng	It has no value.
3818811	eng	Are you on vacation?
3818813	eng	I'm officially on vacation.
3818814	eng	Tom is on vacation.
3818815	eng	They're all on vacation.
3818817	eng	This isn't a vacation.
3818821	eng	This website is useless.
3818839	eng	Who can stop us?
3818845	eng	Why'd they call us?
3818932	eng	They look like us.
3818934	eng	Tom walked back upstairs.
3818938	eng	Tom still looks upset.
3818961	eng	I've just woken up.
3818962	eng	I'm just warming up.
3818972	eng	The results were unpredictable.
3818973	eng	Tom wanted to unpack.
3818975	eng	I think it's unnecessary.
3818976	eng	I was very unlucky.
3818977	eng	Tom was really unlucky.
3818978	eng	I was really unlucky.
3818980	eng	They were really unlucky.
3818981	eng	This cat is unlucky.
3818983	eng	Don't be so unkind.
3818985	eng	This house is uninhabitable.
3818987	eng	I feel very unhappy.
3818989	eng	Tom still looks unhappy.
3818993	eng	The result was unexpected.
3818999	eng	Why can't you understand?
3819000	eng	I think you understand.
3819005	eng	There's nothing to understand.
3819007	eng	It's hard to understand.
3819008	eng	Not everyone will understand.
3819010	eng	Of course, I understand.
3819011	eng	I'm still very undecided.
3819012	eng	Tom still felt uncomfortable.
3819016	eng	This isn't my umbrella.
3819026	eng	I'm not your type.
3819034	eng	We could take turns.
3819041	eng	I'm willing to try.
3819050	eng	We want the truth.
3819057	eng	Can Tom be trusted?
3819060	eng	I hate that trumpet.
3819065	eng	Is it still true?
3819067	eng	Say it's not true.
3819068	eng	Say that's not true.
3819073	eng	The opposite is true.
3819081	eng	I'm not a trucker.
3819085	eng	I had some trouble.
3819088	eng	How was the trip?
3819092	eng	I pulled the trigger.
3819098	eng	This is my treat.
3819102	eng	I burned the trash.
3819107	eng	I'll come by train.
3819130	eng	Don't change the topic.
3819132	eng	I've chipped a tooth.
3819144	eng	I miss you, too.
3819147	eng	We missed you, too.
3819149	eng	I hate it, too.
3819150	eng	I enjoyed it, too.
3819155	eng	I saw that, too.
3819156	eng	I love cats, too.
3819160	eng	I'm on vacation, too.
3819166	eng	You were there, too.
3819167	eng	It's raining here, too.
3819168	eng	It bothers me, too.
3819173	eng	Tom was worried, too.
3819180	eng	Are you open tonight?
3819181	eng	Who'll be there tonight?
3819185	eng	Let's go out tonight.
3819186	eng	We're sold out tonight.
3819187	eng	Think about it tonight.
3819196	eng	I'll be back tonight.
3819199	eng	Expect a surprise tonight.
3819201	eng	I'll be home tonight.
3819205	eng	Can I start tomorrow?
3819216	eng	I need you tomorrow.
3819218	eng	I need that tomorrow.
3819222	eng	I'll do this tomorrow.
3819223	eng	Our wedding is tomorrow.
3819226	eng	You'll feel better tomorrow.
3819234	eng	I start working tomorrow.
3819239	eng	Are you really Tom?
3819250	eng	Who wrote to Tom?
3819266	eng	Don't you believe Tom?
3819277	eng	Will you stay, Tom?
3819291	eng	Are you coming, Tom?
3819303	eng	Stop talking about Tom.
3819304	eng	Don't lie about Tom.
3819314	eng	I didn't kiss Tom.
3819315	eng	The problem is Tom.
3819320	eng	That's not for Tom.
3819336	eng	I still remember Tom.
3819360	eng	Just apologize to Tom.
3819363	eng	Don't lie to Tom.
3819367	eng	I'm married to Tom.
3819369	eng	Don't count on Tom.
3819394	eng	I'll talk with Tom.
3819398	eng	I'm studying with Tom.
3819399	eng	I'm staying with Tom.
3819413	eng	I really love Tom.
3819417	eng	You shouldn't underestimate Tom.
3819419	eng	I did surprise Tom.
3819420	eng	Try to ignore Tom.
3819438	eng	I can't understand Tom.
3819440	eng	I really loved Tom.
3819441	eng	I just missed Tom.
3819442	eng	I just fired Tom.
3819444	eng	Someone has warned Tom.
3819446	eng	Don't get angry, Tom.
3819457	eng	I know that, Tom.
3819464	eng	Sing it again, Tom.
3819468	eng	Your telephone's ringing, Tom.
3819474	eng	Come with me, Tom.
3819478	eng	Here's your tea, Tom.
3819483	eng	Do you work together?
3819492	eng	They both left together.
3819493	eng	Let's do that together.
3819498	eng	We could learn together.
3819501	eng	Try to work together.
3819513	eng	Can you start today?
3819518	eng	What's your problem today?
3819519	eng	Is the exam today?
3819529	eng	What's your schedule today?
3819545	eng	You're very quiet today.
3819551	eng	I'm done for today.
3819574	eng	I'll be late today.
3819585	eng	Tom didn't come today.
3819590	eng	I feel romantic today.
3819598	eng	Where's Tom moving to?
3819635	eng	I'm now very tired.
3819636	eng	I'm really, really tired.
3819637	eng	I was already tired.
3819638	eng	I never got tired.
3819640	eng	Now I feel tired.
3819642	eng	I'm sure you're tired.
3819652	eng	What's our arrival time?
3819670	eng	Things change over time.
3819705	eng	You still have time.
3819712	eng	We've lost valuable time.
3819722	eng	Now's a bad time.
3819728	eng	I have two tickets.
3819738	eng	I'm just passing through.
3819739	eng	Do you feel threatened?
3819740	eng	Did you feel threatened?
3819747	eng	What's wrong with those?
3819753	eng	Can anyone verify this?
3819764	eng	Shouldn't we report this?
3819792	eng	Can I use this?
3819796	eng	Have you tried this?
3819802	eng	I won't eat this.
3819830	eng	I miss all this.
3819837	eng	You can accomplish this.
3819839	eng	I'm not getting this.
3819843	eng	You'll regret doing this.
3819851	eng	I didn't write this.
3819863	eng	I also found this.
3819865	eng	I've never liked this.
3819866	eng	I really needed this.
3819892	eng	It made me think.
3819898	eng	You're exaggerating, I think.
3819902	eng	I saw many things.
3819905	eng	Don't touch my things.
3819907	eng	I have my things.
3819916	eng	I hate those things.
3819938	eng	How large were they?
3819940	eng	How large are they?
3819941	eng	What's wrong with these?
3819944	eng	Do you like these?
3819946	eng	Tom sent me these.
3819949	eng	Who put it there?
3819954	eng	What's hidden in there?
3819962	eng	Is there something there?
3819976	eng	Just leave that there.
3819980	eng	Sit down over there.
3819987	eng	Tom's always been there.
3819989	eng	I left everything there.
3820003	eng	Everyone will be there.
3820006	eng	I should be there.
3820015	eng	Things were different then.
3820029	eng	Did you catch them?
3820031	eng	Do you recognize them?
3820032	eng	Do you like them?
3820033	eng	Do you need them?
3820040	eng	Don't count on them.
3820051	eng	Everyone gathered around them.
3820053	eng	I never trusted them.
3820056	eng	Would you buy that?
3820062	eng	What's funny about that?
3820070	eng	Should I repeat that?
3820134	eng	I would enjoy that.
3820141	eng	We already knew that.
3820142	eng	I already knew that.
3820161	eng	Stop talking about that.
3820173	eng	I read about that.
3820180	eng	Tom always does that.
3820185	eng	I can't remember that.
3820186	eng	I'll always remember that.
3820199	eng	Tom shouldn't do that.
3820207	eng	Don't ever do that.
3820258	eng	I've never forgotten that.
3820260	eng	I've never seen that.
3820267	eng	I'm not saying that.
3820275	eng	I regretted doing that.
3820281	eng	I can't promise that.
3820286	eng	Tom sent me that.
3820305	eng	Nothing will change that.
3820306	eng	I hadn't heard that.
3820309	eng	I already sold that.
3820319	eng	I've never liked that.
3820320	eng	I really needed that.
3820321	eng	I never noticed that.
3820328	eng	It's not so terrible.
3820339	eng	I work in telecommunications.
3820347	eng	I have fun teaching.
3820349	eng	My parents were teachers.
3820350	eng	Tom's parents are teachers.
3820351	eng	Tom has good teachers.
3820363	eng	I'm a school teacher.
3820364	eng	That's our French teacher.
3820365	eng	I trust the teacher.
3820370	eng	I love to teach.
3820373	eng	Tom likes herbal tea.
3820379	eng	I love that tattoo.
3820380	eng	What a beautiful tattoo!
3820390	eng	Which would you take?
3820404	eng	It's a beautiful sword.
3820416	eng	Tom bought a sweater.
3820417	eng	I'm drenched in sweat.
3820420	eng	Don't be so suspicious.
3820422	eng	I had my suspicions.
3820424	eng	I hope I survive.
3820429	eng	I was very surprised.
3820431	eng	Well, I'm not surprised.
3820434	eng	Tom must've been surprised.
3820440	eng	It wasn't a surprise.
3820442	eng	Can I go surfing?
3820450	eng	You have my support.
3820459	eng	I wanted to sunbathe.
3820481	eng	Give me some suggestions.
3820485	eng	I was very successful.
3820488	eng	I hope to succeed.
3820492	eng	I think you'll succeed.
3820493	eng	I hope I succeed.
3820494	eng	I'll come by subway.
3820508	eng	We're not that stupid.
3820509	eng	We aren't that stupid.
3820513	eng	My friends are stupid.
3820518	eng	This is serious stuff.
3820522	eng	I bought some stuff.
3820525	eng	Shouldn't you be studying?
3820528	eng	What did you study?
3820530	eng	I suggest you study.
3820535	eng	Are they all strong?
3820536	eng	I feel very strong.
3820540	eng	I have to stretch.
3820550	eng	That's a risky strategy.
3820551	eng	I'd never trust strangers.
3820558	eng	It's not so strange.
3820560	eng	It may seem strange.
3820566	eng	Who'd believe your story?
3820574	eng	What a touching story!
3820575	eng	What a pathetic story!
3820576	eng	What a tragic story!
3820581	eng	It's time to stop.
3820586	eng	Perhaps you should stop.
3820588	eng	My thermos was stolen.
3820589	eng	My car was stolen.
3820590	eng	My journal was stolen.
3820591	eng	My microscope was stolen.
3820593	eng	My bicycle's been stolen.
3820594	eng	Don't be so stingy.
3820596	eng	Try to stand still.
3820597	eng	My hands are sticky.
3820601	eng	Watch where you step.
3820602	eng	What did you steal?
3820613	eng	Shall we get started?
3820615	eng	When does school start?
3820618	eng	We need to start.
3820625	eng	Your shirt is stained.
3820638	eng	What's causing that sound?
3820639	eng	What's that awful sound?
3820642	eng	Listen, I'm really sorry.
3820657	eng	You should come soon.
3820668	eng	Who sang this song?
3820670	eng	Who wrote this song?
3820676	eng	It's just a song.
3820677	eng	I'm writing a song.
3820683	eng	It still happens sometimes.
3820685	eng	I get homesick sometimes.
3820690	eng	Are you planning something?
3820698	eng	Tom always wants something.
3820704	eng	Maybe you missed something.
3820709	eng	I'll visit you someday.
3820712	eng	This is the solution.
3820716	eng	They were just soldiers.
3820718	eng	It was too soft.
3820726	eng	I major in sociology.
3820729	eng	Say it's not so.
3820730	eng	I always thought so.
3820740	eng	Tom told me so.
3820743	eng	I'm making a snowman.
3820744	eng	I made a snowman.
3820746	eng	Tom is shoveling snow.
3820748	eng	I don't usually snore.
3820756	eng	Has Tom quit smoking?
3820762	eng	You made me smile.
3820766	eng	Tom works very slowly.
3820768	eng	I'm tired of slogans.
3820769	eng	Your grades are slipping.
3820770	eng	Tom still looks sleepy.
3820771	eng	I bet nobody's sleepy.
3820772	eng	I was getting sleepy.
3820773	eng	I'm sure you're sleepy.
3820778	eng	Where do you sleep?
3820780	eng	Let's try to sleep.
3820792	eng	I love to skate.
3820798	eng	You've misjudged the situation.
3820799	eng	Why aren't you sitting?
3820803	eng	Is the island sinking?
3820804	eng	The island is sinking.
3820809	eng	Where are the singers?
3820819	eng	The explanation is simple.
3820820	eng	It was so simple.
3820827	eng	Where should I sign?
3820831	eng	Tom looked very sick.
3820832	eng	No one got sick.
3820840	eng	My cat loves shrimp.
3820842	eng	How was the show?
3820851	eng	Tom hurt his shoulder.
3820857	eng	Let's make it short.
3820861	eng	It's a small shop.
3820862	eng	Where are my shoes?
3820864	eng	I polished my shoes.
3820866	eng	I polished Tom's shoes.
3820869	eng	I changed my shirt.
3820870	eng	That's my favorite shirt.
3820877	eng	You've done your share.
3820881	eng	Why are you shaking?
3820883	eng	Sometimes my hands shake.
3820888	eng	I'm considering it seriously.
3820891	eng	Tom looked very serious.
3820893	eng	This time it's serious.
3820895	eng	Look, I'm being serious.
3820897	eng	Don't be so sentimental.
3820899	eng	I attended the seminar.
3820902	eng	I was very selfish.
3820914	eng	You need a secretary.
3820916	eng	You've discovered my secret.
3820917	eng	I know the secret.
3820925	eng	Give me the screwdriver.
3820949	eng	It's not that scary.
3821010	eng	I was quite satisfied.
3821015	eng	Tom made some sandwiches.
3821026	eng	It's always the same.
3821028	eng	It was the same.
3821029	eng	I'll do the same.
3821030	eng	You're still the same.
3821034	eng	It's still for sale.
3821035	eng	Tom's not a saint.
3821065	eng	I hope it's safe.
3821071	eng	This book is Tom's.
3821079	eng	It was a rumor.
3821082	eng	This is a rule.
3821083	eng	What a beautiful rose!
3821086	eng	Tom was my roommate.
3821098	eng	Tom cleaned his room.
3821100	eng	This is our room.
3821109	eng	You're always so romantic.
3821110	eng	Did you bring rolls?
3821112	eng	I'll buy some rolls.
3821117	eng	This is very risky.
3821121	eng	It was a riot.
3821128	eng	Was your father right?
3821136	eng	Tom is partly right.
3821139	eng	Your father was right.
3821143	eng	Yes, you're quite right.
3821146	eng	Your parents were right.
3821147	eng	I think they're right.
3821148	eng	You should've turned right.
3821151	eng	I hear you're rich.
3821154	eng	I didn't order rice.
3821170	eng	I recommend that restaurant.
3821177	eng	Tom is very responsible.
3821179	eng	How would you respond?
3821180	eng	You have our respect.
3821183	eng	You have to resign.
3821186	eng	Your help isn't required.
3821194	eng	I heard the report.
3821199	eng	Who'll pay the rent?
3821206	eng	Who do you remember?
3821207	eng	This really is remarkable.
3821208	eng	Now I feel relieved.
3821209	eng	They all looked relieved.
3821212	eng	I think it's reliable.
3821214	eng	The prisoners were released.
3821215	eng	Tom wants to relax.
3821222	eng	My request was refused.
3821223	eng	Tom's request was refused.
3821228	eng	I really like red.
3821234	eng	Did that happen recently?
3821237	eng	I have my reasons.
3821238	eng	Your offer is reasonable.
3821241	eng	What's the other reason?
3821245	eng	Is the food ready?
3821248	eng	Our team is ready.
3821263	eng	What did you read?
3821264	eng	I love to read.
3821266	eng	What's your hourly rate?
3821267	eng	You deserve a raise.
3821268	eng	I'd like a raise.
3821272	eng	Let's pray for rain.
3821275	eng	I won the race.
3821278	eng	I want a raccoon.
3821284	eng	Is your room quiet?
3821287	eng	We'd better be quiet.
3821305	eng	Now what's your question?
3821310	eng	You're avoiding the question.
3821314	eng	Don't be so pushy.
3821315	eng	Tom stole my purse.
3821316	eng	Why do cats purr?
3821324	eng	I've already been punished.
3821325	eng	I've just been punished.
3821327	eng	Tom should be punished.
3821329	eng	Where was it published?
3821333	eng	I'm not a prude.
3821341	eng	I've kept my promise.
3821345	eng	That should be prohibited.
3821349	eng	I love that program.
3821358	eng	I have heart problems.
3821361	eng	We solved both problems.
3821367	eng	Who'll handle this problem?
3821368	eng	What was their problem?
3821369	eng	Is this the problem?
3821371	eng	That's the only problem.
3821384	eng	Tom solved the problem.
3821385	eng	Now that's a problem.
3821387	eng	Who won the prize?
3821395	eng	They met in prison.
3821401	eng	Your doll's very pretty.
3821409	eng	What happened was predictable.
3821413	eng	You'll improve with practice.
3821418	eng	Is that really possible?
3821424	eng	Unfortunately, it's not possible.
3821433	eng	Don't eat raw pork.
3821447	eng	Tom was very polite.
3821448	eng	I was very polite.
3821450	eng	Try to be polite.
3821458	eng	Hand me the pliers.
3821462	eng	Somebody, help me, please.
3821497	eng	Tom has perfect pitch.
3821503	eng	I'm just taking pictures.
3821510	eng	I took this picture.
3821515	eng	You're being too picky.
3821519	eng	I saw your photos.
3821521	eng	I've never been photographed.
3821525	eng	I remember this photo.
3821527	eng	I took the photo.
3821535	eng	I know them personally.
3821536	eng	I'm a serious person.
3821538	eng	I'm an educated person.
3821541	eng	My plan worked perfectly.
3821543	eng	It's far from perfect.
3821547	eng	I like honest people.
3821552	eng	Tom sharpened the pencils.
3821555	eng	Put down that pen.
3821558	eng	Do you like pears?
3821563	eng	No one here pays.
3821566	eng	Tom refused to pay.
3821569	eng	I'm a cancer patient.
3821571	eng	Tom might lose patience.
3821572	eng	I overcooked the pasta.
3821582	eng	Don't forget your passport.
3821583	eng	The danger has passed.
3821606	eng	I wanted to participate.
3821614	eng	Where are your parents?
3821619	eng	Tom signed the papers.
3821626	eng	Tom looked very pale.
3821632	eng	Divorce is always painful.
3821637	eng	Have you already paid?
3821643	eng	Why are you packing?
3821658	eng	It was an oversight.
3821659	eng	It was really overpriced.
3821664	eng	Should I take over?
3821667	eng	Please do it over.
3821669	eng	The wait is over.
3821670	eng	The revolution is over.
3821672	eng	I hope it's over.
3821675	eng	I heard voices outside.
3821680	eng	What an ugly outfit!
3821694	eng	Don't throw it out.
3821697	eng	I figured that out.
3821700	eng	You look worn out.
3821711	eng	Where were the others?
3821723	eng	They embraced each other.
3821730	eng	Everything was in order.
3821735	eng	You have two options.
3821738	eng	You have three options.
3821739	eng	What's your other option?
3821740	eng	What's our other option?
3821741	eng	What's the other option?
3821742	eng	Try to be optimistic.
3821754	eng	Do you like opera?
3821771	eng	Just say it once.
3821772	eng	I've done that once.
3821774	eng	I was beautiful once.
3821799	eng	Is your family OK?
3821808	eng	Do you travel often?
3821813	eng	Let's meet more often.
3821815	eng	I made it official.
3821834	eng	Take your headphones off.
3821840	eng	What's it made of?
3821849	eng	I'll wait until October.
3821851	eng	It seems pretty obvious.
3821852	eng	The reason is obvious.
3821853	eng	Don't deny the obvious.
3821855	eng	I'm a conscientious objector.
3821858	eng	There were no objections.
3821864	eng	What's your lucky number?
3821868	eng	What's your home number?
3821870	eng	My back is numb.
3821871	eng	My fingers are numb.
3821898	eng	Are you open now?
3821915	eng	I'm very angry now.
3821930	eng	I'm reading it now.
3821951	eng	Don't do that now.
3821956	eng	I'm definitely better now.
3821959	eng	Tom is asleep now.
3821965	eng	You're a professional now.
3821984	eng	Did you take notes?
3821987	eng	Your objection is noted.
3822007	eng	It seems very normal.
3822008	eng	I guess that's normal.
3822009	eng	I'm not so normal.
3822011	eng	This is the norm.
3822014	eng	I heard strange noises.
3822021	eng	Tom told us no.
3822023	eng	I keep having nightmares.
3822026	eng	How was last night?
3822037	eng	We're open tomorrow night.
3822064	eng	Winning is always nice.
3822067	eng	What'll we do next?
3822072	eng	This is great news.
3822079	eng	I want something new.
3822081	eng	You're a real nerd.
3822083	eng	I think we're neighbors.
3822088	eng	Tom hates his neighbor.
3822092	eng	Your help isn't needed.
3822113	eng	Was that really necessary?
3822127	eng	What's your grandfather's name?
3822128	eng	Tom's not my name.
3822136	eng	I'm not completely naive.
3822145	eng	I'm surprised at myself.
3822146	eng	I made this myself.
3822148	eng	Maybe I'm fooling myself.
3822156	eng	Are you two musicians?
3822157	eng	Who taught you music?
3822159	eng	Who composed this music?
3822162	eng	I like country music.
3822164	eng	I enjoy classical music.
3822181	eng	Tom didn't help much.
3822191	eng	It cost too much.
3822193	eng	You eat too much.
3822194	eng	You complain too much.
3822195	eng	You've drunk too much.
3822196	eng	I talked too much.
3822197	eng	Tom didn't do much.
3822199	eng	Tom didn't drink much.
3822200	eng	I hate horror movies.
3822215	eng	I watched a movie.
3822221	eng	Tom had ulterior motives.
3822222	eng	I've lost my motivation.
3822223	eng	Don't tell my mother.
3822225	eng	I'm a single mother.
3822229	eng	I killed the mosquito.
3822233	eng	See you tomorrow morning.
3822234	eng	I'll go tomorrow morning.
3822245	eng	I worked this morning.
3822269	eng	You could give more.
3822270	eng	I'd like some more.
3822291	eng	I've wasted my money.
3822317	eng	Someone owes me money.
3822322	eng	Tom took the money.
3822323	eng	I took the money.
3822325	eng	We're open on Mondays.
3822326	eng	We're closed on Mondays.
3822355	eng	I'm leaving on Monday.
3822374	eng	I want my mom.
3822375	eng	Don't tell my mom.
3822376	eng	I'm a single mom.
3822385	eng	I sometimes make mistakes.
3822386	eng	Sometimes I make mistakes.
3822387	eng	Tom is seriously mistaken.
3822392	eng	Someone made a mistake.
3822400	eng	What have I missed?
3822401	eng	I had a mishap.
3822417	eng	Tom was a miner.
3822418	eng	That moped isn't mine.
3822434	eng	You're out of milk.
3822443	eng	I saw the message.
3822447	eng	Write me a message.
3822451	eng	Your hair's a mess.
3822453	eng	Tom was a mercenary.
3822456	eng	Who cut the melon?
3822457	eng	When's your next meeting?
3822494	eng	Explain what that means.
3822499	eng	That's what I mean.
3822512	eng	Will you support me?
3822516	eng	Will you protect me?
3822570	eng	Are you watching me?
3822573	eng	What's expected of me?
3822583	eng	Don't you see me?
3822584	eng	Have you missed me?
3822597	eng	Your dog bit me.
3822598	eng	You'll eventually forget me.
3822599	eng	Please don't forget me.
3822602	eng	Tom swore at me.
3822608	eng	Nobody ever believes me.
3822609	eng	Tom still hates me.
3822610	eng	Your skill impresses me.
3822611	eng	This place depresses me.
3822612	eng	Tom still despises me.
3822613	eng	Tom always misunderstands me.
3822626	eng	Tom waited for me.
3822629	eng	That didn't bother me.
3822633	eng	Tom didn't help me.
3822646	eng	Nobody writes to me.
3822673	eng	Someone's spying on me.
3822674	eng	Everyone believed in me.
3822685	eng	Come run with me.
3822709	eng	Maybe they'll recognize me.
3822716	eng	Maybe they'll believe me.
3822720	eng	Don't ever leave me.
3822722	eng	You could invite me.
3822723	eng	You shouldn't underestimate me.
3822724	eng	Your parents hate me.
3822727	eng	They can't fire me.
3822736	eng	Tom didn't notice me.
3822739	eng	Everyone gathered around me.
3822748	eng	You could've invited me.
3822750	eng	My grandmother raised me.
3822751	eng	My mother called me.
3822752	eng	You could've asked me.
3822753	eng	Your cat scratched me.
3822755	eng	You've already convinced me.
3822757	eng	Nothing I said mattered.
3822762	eng	It was a massacre.
3822777	eng	Tom didn't hurt Mary.
3822868	eng	Tom should've called Mary.
3822871	eng	Are you already married?
3822877	eng	I remember this map.
3822878	eng	I'll do it manually.
3822881	eng	Tom has good manners.
3822885	eng	Who was the man?
3822888	eng	Look at that man.
3822890	eng	You're a cruel man.
3822891	eng	You're a rich man.
3822896	eng	Unfortunately, they're the majority.
3822898	eng	You've got it made.
3822903	eng	We've just finished lunch.
3822906	eng	You were pretty lucky.
3822907	eng	I'm also very lucky.
3822908	eng	I'm not that lucky.
3822914	eng	Am I in love?
3822917	eng	I'm officially in love.
3822918	eng	I believe in love.
3822924	eng	I've seen a lot.
3822928	eng	I've moved a lot.
3822929	eng	I missed a lot.
3822936	eng	You're a real loser.
3822957	eng	Did you wait long?
3822968	eng	It was too long.
3822979	eng	Please open your locker.
3822988	eng	Organ donations save lives.
3823000	eng	All right, I'm listening.
3823002	eng	Why couldn't you listen?
3823005	eng	Sit back and listen.
3823006	eng	Maybe you should listen.
3823037	eng	Tom's risking his life.
3823043	eng	Was that a lie?
3823044	eng	Why would I lie?
3823045	eng	I almost never lie.
3823050	eng	I got my license.
3823059	eng	There were three letters.
3823083	eng	You should've turned left.
3823087	eng	Why are you leaving?
3823103	eng	I'm going to leave.
3823109	eng	You never stop learning.
3823117	eng	I'm here to learn.
3823118	eng	Think before you leap.
3823120	eng	Tom is very lazy.
3823124	eng	What made you laugh?
3823125	eng	Don't you ever laugh?
3823126	eng	Do you ever laugh?
3823127	eng	Everyone began to laugh.
3823134	eng	We'll stop by later.
3823135	eng	We'll join you later.
3823143	eng	Please try again later.
3823157	eng	I was really late.
3823158	eng	I'm almost always late.
3823162	eng	The bus was late.
3823164	eng	You're not too late.
3823166	eng	I arrived too late.
3823168	eng	We always arrive late.
3823181	eng	I always arrived late.
3823182	eng	Let's hope it lasts.
3823193	eng	I read the label.
3823199	eng	What would you know?
3823214	eng	You need to know.
3823219	eng	They're armed with knives.
3823221	eng	It's a kitchen knife.
3823228	eng	I almost got killed.
3823235	eng	I'm a big kid.
3823244	eng	I found the keys.
3823250	eng	I love apple juice.
3823251	eng	Tom's a great journalist.
3823257	eng	I miss your jokes.
3823267	eng	What a stupid joke!
3823278	eng	Tom has changed jobs.
3823283	eng	Actually, it's my job.
3823296	eng	I got a job.
3823302	eng	Tom was wearing jeans.
3823304	eng	Tom was a janitor.
3823317	eng	Should I repeat it?
3823321	eng	Didn't you miss it?
3823323	eng	What exactly is it?
3823325	eng	How cold is it?
3823328	eng	How large was it?
3823332	eng	Can't you do it?
3823343	eng	Did you push it?
3823366	eng	We all knew it.
3823375	eng	Don't think about it.
3823391	eng	I highly doubt it.
3823401	eng	I'd look into it.
3823420	eng	They can do it.
3823421	eng	We can do it.
3823434	eng	Tom had forgotten it.
3823454	eng	Tom can't use it.
3823457	eng	I've already done it.
3823467	eng	They can afford it.
3823472	eng	I already did it.
3823478	eng	We all enjoyed it.
3823483	eng	I initially hated it.
3823487	eng	It's a complex issue.
3823514	eng	I have the invoice.
3823515	eng	Why was Tom invited?
3823516	eng	Why was I invited?
3823518	eng	There was no investigation.
3823519	eng	Your argument is invalid.
3823537	eng	It might be interesting.
3823538	eng	This could be interesting.
3823541	eng	They all have insurance.
3823545	eng	Who was your inspiration?
3823557	eng	This is interesting indeed.
3823559	eng	Some diseases are incurable.
3823563	eng	I reported the incident.
3823564	eng	Your comment is inappropriate.
3823566	eng	Can I join in?
3823572	eng	I'll be right in.
3823581	eng	The situation hasn't improved.
3823583	eng	I'm trying to improve.
3823584	eng	It was very impressive.
3823588	eng	This is technically impossible.
3823590	eng	They say it's impossible.
3823592	eng	I know that's impossible.
3823595	eng	Your opinion is important.
3823596	eng	They say it's important.
3823599	eng	This could be important.
3823601	eng	No one is immortal.
3823603	eng	I'll do that immediately.
3823604	eng	I said yes immediately.
3823606	eng	I recognized Tom immediately.
3823623	eng	Tom stole my idea.
3823634	eng	What a brilliant idea!
3823635	eng	What a weird idea!
3823639	eng	I'm not a hypocrite.
3823643	eng	Does it really hurt?
3823644	eng	Where were you hurt?
3823651	eng	Some people were hurt.
3823660	eng	Didn't you get hungry?
3823663	eng	I was really hungry.
3823666	eng	Tom didn't seem hungry.
3823667	eng	I'm sure you're hungry.
3823671	eng	I'm cold and hungry.
3823672	eng	That would be humiliating.
3823674	eng	What's causing that hum?
3823676	eng	I have a housekeeper.
3823684	eng	That's my father's house.
3823692	eng	They cleaned the house.
3823714	eng	They've got a hostage.
3823731	eng	Who stole my horse?
3823733	eng	Tom bought a horse.
3823734	eng	This picture is horrible.
3823740	eng	Don't you feel honored?
3823743	eng	At least they're honest.
3823757	eng	I sometimes get homesick.
3823758	eng	Tom says he's homesick.
3823794	eng	Let's go back home.
3823800	eng	Please come back home.
3823804	eng	Tom finally came home.
3823809	eng	I'm here on holiday.
3823810	eng	Where's your pot holder?
3823813	eng	Unfortunately, it's a hoax.
3823825	eng	Tom's talking to himself.
3823876	eng	Tom was a hero.
3823889	eng	Is your mother here?
3823912	eng	What's this stuff here?
3823927	eng	What exactly happened here?
3823936	eng	Let me stay here.
3823938	eng	It's windy out here.
3823940	eng	Please just wait here.
3823960	eng	You may sleep here.
3823979	eng	Leave your suitcase here.
3823988	eng	You should come here.
3823993	eng	You're perfectly safe here.
3823994	eng	We're not safe here.
3823995	eng	We aren't safe here.
3824010	eng	I'm on guard here.
3824012	eng	We're almost finished here.
3824028	eng	You were very helpful.
3824029	eng	You were really helpful.
3824030	eng	You're always so helpful.
3824031	eng	It may be helpful.
3824033	eng	Nothing I did helped.
3824045	eng	Would you please help?
3824080	eng	Maybe I could help.
3824088	eng	Are you wearing heels?
3824121	eng	Hold onto your hats.
3824123	eng	You stole my hat.
3824127	eng	Don't be too hasty.
3824128	eng	This is a harpoon.
3824129	eng	Tom is a harpist.
3824134	eng	We should try harder.
3824144	eng	It's raining pretty hard.
3824146	eng	I tried really hard.
3824159	eng	Tom was really happy.
3824168	eng	Tom didn't seem happy.
3824175	eng	You'll soon be happy.
3824179	eng	Let me be happy.
3824181	eng	Maybe it really happens.
3824198	eng	Who knows what happened?
3824219	eng	These things never happened.
3824227	eng	Who knows what'll happen?
3824243	eng	Look what can happen.
3824252	eng	Tom is a handyman.
3824271	eng	I'm losing my hair.
3824274	eng	It's now a habit.
3824279	eng	They're all good guys.
3824283	eng	I recognize that guy.
3824290	eng	They're armed with guns.
3824304	eng	I feel very guilty.
3824306	eng	I almost feel guilty.
3824307	eng	Now I feel guilty.
3824310	eng	Tonight I have guests.
3824314	eng	Don't be so grumpy.
3824319	eng	Why are you grinning?
3824321	eng	Tom is really greedy.
3824324	eng	That massage felt great.
3824331	eng	These are my grandchildren.
3824332	eng	Tom hasn't yet graduated.
3824333	eng	When will you graduate?
3824342	eng	It sounds very good.
3824343	eng	You've been very good.
3824347	eng	Tom's idea seems good.
3824348	eng	The breeze feels good.
3824349	eng	This beef is good.
3824351	eng	We hope it's good.
3824353	eng	It was so good.
3824355	eng	It was all good.
3824357	eng	Let's do something good.
3824358	eng	Those chocolates were good.
3824359	eng	The results are good.
3824390	eng	Why don't I go?
3824391	eng	Where should I go?
3824394	eng	I might not go.
3824405	eng	I refuse to go.
3824412	eng	Let the dog go.
3824415	eng	Where are Tom's gloves?
3824427	eng	Don't scare the girls.
3824429	eng	I need a girlfriend.
3824433	eng	I'm a simple girl.
3824434	eng	I met a girl.
3824438	eng	What a lovely gift!
3824443	eng	Tom was a gentleman.
3824452	eng	Tom is a gangster.
3824453	eng	I like video games.
3824456	eng	Who won the game?
3824467	eng	I saw the game.
3824471	eng	Let's play a game.
3824482	eng	The creek was frozen.
3824486	eng	What's Tom running from?
3824489	eng	What's Tom hiding from?
3824494	eng	Are they your friends?
3824498	eng	I trust my friends.
3824500	eng	I recognized my friends.
3824505	eng	They know we're friends.
3824507	eng	Let's all be friends.
3824510	eng	We're very good friends.
3824515	eng	It's for my friend.
3824517	eng	You're my closest friend.
3824520	eng	I'll be your friend.
3824522	eng	I need a friend.
3824523	eng	I'm just a freshman.
3824531	eng	Are you learning French?
3824568	eng	I recommend studying French.
3824574	eng	That sounds like French.
3824575	eng	This sounds like French.
3824582	eng	Everyone loves a freebie.
3824583	eng	Is it really free?
3824589	eng	Here's what we found.
3824626	eng	It's all paid for.
3824637	eng	I'm just a fool.
3824638	eng	I was a fool.
3824645	eng	Tom loves spicy food.
3824646	eng	We want healthier food.
3824651	eng	We want more food.
3824652	eng	I want more food.
3824655	eng	I just love flowers.
3824666	eng	I like to fish.
3824673	eng	I was there first.
3824674	eng	You're not the first.
3824681	eng	Don't mess with fire.
3824688	eng	I manage just fine.
3824689	eng	You did just fine.
3824697	eng	I guess that's final.
3824698	eng	Your feet are filthy.
3824707	eng	I've seen a few.
3824708	eng	I've got a fever.
3824709	eng	I'll come by ferry.
3824711	eng	Tom fixed the fence.
3824716	eng	I had that feeling.
3824725	eng	Is that my fault?
3824726	eng	How's that your fault?
3824728	eng	It's completely my fault.
3824730	eng	It's probably my fault.
3824735	eng	It's not anyone's fault.
3824736	eng	It's always your fault.
3824738	eng	It's my own fault.
3824740	eng	Don't use this faucet.
3824746	eng	I believe in fate.
3824750	eng	Tom is too fat.
3824753	eng	You eat too fast.
3824754	eng	Tom is very old-fashioned.
3824759	eng	I'm not a fanatic.
3824760	eng	I'm not a fan.
3824775	eng	It seems so familiar.
3824777	eng	I think that's fake.
3824778	eng	They must be fake.
3824779	eng	These must be fake.
3824781	eng	I think it's fair.
3824783	eng	You're not being fair.
3824784	eng	You aren't being fair.
3824786	eng	That wouldn't be fair.
3824787	eng	I think I fainted.
3824788	eng	Why did we fail?
3824789	eng	We want the facts.
3824795	eng	Go wash your face.
3824799	eng	You have lovely eyes.
3824803	eng	I heard the explosions.
3824804	eng	There was no explosion.
3824813	eng	What should I explain?
3824821	eng	This horse is expensive.
3824822	eng	This table is expensive.
3824826	eng	Everything went as expected.
3824834	eng	Tom has unrealistic expectations.
3824835	eng	What can you expect?
3824839	eng	Does that still exist?
3824842	eng	I need to exercise.
3824843	eng	This is really exciting.
3824844	eng	It was really exciting.
3824845	eng	That must be exciting.
3824846	eng	It could be exciting.
3824849	eng	There are always exceptions.
3824850	eng	There are no exceptions.
3824851	eng	Your French is excellent.
3824853	eng	I've finished my exams.
3824873	eng	English is spoken everywhere.
3824876	eng	Have you understood everything?
3824877	eng	Did you understand everything?
3824879	eng	Soon you'll know everything.
3824886	eng	My husband notices everything.
3824889	eng	I listen to everything.
3824892	eng	We agree on everything.
3824896	eng	I'm tired of everything.
3824899	eng	Tom already understood everything.
3824901	eng	Tom didn't comprehend everything.
3824902	eng	I accidentally deleted everything.
3824903	eng	Tom has denied everything.
3824906	eng	I already knew everyone.
3824926	eng	Tom made three errors.
3824933	eng	Was I polite enough?
3824937	eng	Now I've had enough.
3824939	eng	Do you understand English?
3824941	eng	I'm the chief engineer.
3824944	eng	I have no energy.
3824948	eng	Where will it end?
3824955	eng	You're getting too emotional.
3824957	eng	This is very embarrassing.
3824958	eng	This is really embarrassing.
3824959	eng	It's something really embarrassing.
3824960	eng	Tom looked very embarrassed.
3824982	eng	Please don't waste electricity.
3824985	eng	I may be elected.
3824998	eng	Tom has finished eating.
3825010	eng	It's become very easy.
3825011	eng	I took it easy.
3825017	eng	I felt the earthquake.
3825021	eng	It's not too early.
3825022	eng	I left too early.
3825026	eng	Try to come early.
3825031	eng	I noticed that earlier.
3825047	eng	Tom was dead drunk.
3825049	eng	You were definitely drugged.
3825050	eng	Alcohol is a drug.
3825063	eng	I almost never drink.
3825076	eng	Tom closed the drawer.
3825079	eng	Do you work downtown?
3825090	eng	I have my doubts.
3825092	eng	Is there any doubt?
3825094	eng	They closed the doors.
3825100	eng	Don't shut the door.
3825109	eng	Someone unlocked the door.
3825162	eng	Look what they're doing.
3825172	eng	I want this dog.
3825186	eng	How did they do?
3825313	eng	Sorry, I was distracted.
3825315	eng	I was quite dissatisfied.
3825317	eng	I washed the dishes.
3825321	eng	It's a bad disease.
3825322	eng	What are you discussing?
3825327	eng	Let's not get discouraged.
3825329	eng	I'm not a disbeliever.
3825332	eng	I was very disappointed.
3825334	eng	You have to disappear.
3825344	eng	We're ready for dinner.
3825346	eng	You're invited to dinner.
3825352	eng	The exam was difficult.
3825353	eng	It's all so difficult.
3825358	eng	Wow, you look different.
3825360	eng	Try eating something different.
3825375	eng	Look what you did.
3825389	eng	I want this dictionary.
3825391	eng	Do you have diabetes?
3825397	eng	It's what we deserve.
3825408	eng	This is really delicate.
3825411	eng	Is the well deep?
3825420	eng	Have you finally decided?
3825427	eng	You look like death.
3825437	eng	Everyone thinks you're dead.
3825441	eng	I'm happy these days.
3825454	eng	I practiced every day.
3825459	eng	Today's a beautiful day.
3825477	eng	What a lousy day!
3825478	eng	Is this your daughter?
3825500	eng	What's in that cupboard?
3825501	eng	I love this cup.
3825503	eng	I filled the cup.
3825507	eng	Tom fell asleep crying.
3825511	eng	It's OK to cry.
3825517	eng	Your advice is critical.
3825518	eng	It made me cringe.
3825525	eng	You've lost your credibility.
3825526	eng	They've lost all credibility.
3825528	eng	Everyone likes ice cream.
3825533	eng	This is really crazy.
3825536	eng	I'm definitely going crazy.
3825537	eng	You drive me crazy.
3825560	eng	I hope you're correct.
3825566	eng	It was pretty cool.
3825567	eng	Tom is very cool.
3825571	eng	I was pretty convinced.
3825572	eng	I was already convinced.
3825574	eng	I'm not so convinced.
3825575	eng	I'm not too convinced.
3825577	eng	I hope you're convinced.
3825582	eng	It's all a conspiracy.
3825584	eng	I'm not a connoisseur.
3825588	eng	That must be confusing.
3825589	eng	Now I'm really confused.
3825590	eng	I think you're confused.
3825591	eng	You must be confused.
3825593	eng	I'm not very confident.
3825595	eng	You signed a confession.
3825598	eng	I'm in good condition.
3825599	eng	Try to be concise.
3825601	eng	Where is the concert?
3825608	eng	Should we be concerned?
3825609	eng	Tom looks very concerned.
3825618	eng	Is it too complicated?
3825620	eng	The problem is complex.
3825623	eng	I have no complaints.
3825627	eng	We shouldn't have complained.
3825632	eng	I missed the competition.
3825633	eng	It was a competition.
3825639	eng	You're in good company.
3825642	eng	Tom works on commission.
3825648	eng	This is so comfortable.
3825651	eng	Tom was a comedian.
3825657	eng	Nobody wants to come.
3825659	eng	I'm planning to come.
3825676	eng	This pizza is cold.
3825678	eng	I hate the cold.
3825680	eng	Is it a coincidence?
3825682	eng	I never drink coffee.
3825685	eng	This is a coconut.
3825696	eng	What's in that closet?
3825701	eng	Was the bank closed?
3825712	eng	You were very clear.
3825724	eng	I love this city.
3825727	eng	I'm a US citizen.
3825730	eng	I go to church.
3825735	eng	Tom is very choosy.
3825740	eng	I have high cholesterol.
3825745	eng	What's the third choice?
3825754	eng	I can't eat chocolate.
3825760	eng	Look after your children.
3825763	eng	Don't scare the children.
3825767	eng	You're such a chicken.
3825770	eng	Tom can't play chess.
3825773	eng	Do you like cheese?
3825782	eng	This is very cheap.
3825787	eng	Our climate is changing.
3825793	eng	My situation has changed.
3825794	eng	Nothing much has changed.
3825795	eng	My life has changed.
3825801	eng	The situation won't change.
3825803	eng	Nothing will ever change.
3825805	eng	It's time to change.
3825806	eng	Tom wanted to change.
3825807	eng	I wanted to change.
3825813	eng	It's the last chance.
3825814	eng	We lost our chance.
3825818	eng	There's still a chance.
3825819	eng	We won the championship.
3825822	eng	I accepted the challenge.
3825823	eng	I was appointed chairman.
3825824	eng	Who broke the chair?
3825827	eng	What are you celebrating?
3825828	eng	There's nothing to celebrate.
3825829	eng	I'll buy that CD.
3825841	eng	I also like cats.
3825842	eng	Is that your cat?
3825843	eng	I love my cat.
3825844	eng	I want that cat.
3825845	eng	I hate that cat.
3825846	eng	What a big cat!
3825849	eng	It's just a cartoon.
3825852	eng	Tom's a good carpenter.
3825854	eng	Tom is a carpenter.
3825858	eng	Now listen really carefully.
3825867	eng	Please shuffle the cards.
3825870	eng	Who owns that car?
3825877	eng	I'll come by car.

4012700	eng	What could've caused this?
4012707	eng	We should've anticipated this.
4012730	eng	What will Tom think?
4012799	eng	No one's in there.
4012837	eng	That's an interesting theory.
4012876	eng	Thanks for sharing that.
4012878	eng	Please stop saying that.
4012903	eng	Thanks for noticing that.
4012935	eng	Thanks for holding that.
4012954	eng	Who could've done that?
4013039	eng	There's no denying that.
4013041	eng	Nothing can change that.
4013066	eng	Can we afford that?
4013080	eng	What's unusual about that?
4013101	eng	Tom doesn't play tennis.
4013157	eng	There were three survivors.
4013161	eng	That was pretty surprising.
4013162	eng	What an unpleasant surprise!
4013163	eng	What an unexpected surprise!
4013165	eng	What an incredible surprise!
4013174	eng	Have a good summer.
4013205	eng	Please remain perfectly still.
4013231	eng	Well, let's get started.
4013233	eng	Go ahead and start.
4013255	eng	My shift's over soon.
4013277	eng	What's that disgusting smell?
4013289	eng	It's really very simple.
4013294	eng	It's really quite simple.
4013302	eng	There was absolute silence.
4013305	eng	Tom isn't really sick.
4013309	eng	Why is everybody shouting?
4013317	eng	I love those shoes.
4013342	eng	Tom lacks common sense.
4013442	eng	That's what everyone says.
4013476	eng	Why is everybody running?
4013557	eng	Thanks for the reminder.
4013567	eng	Tom demanded a refund.
4013571	eng	What would you recommend?
4013583	eng	It's very simple, really.
4013587	eng	Are the muffins ready?
4013600	eng	It's already started raining.
4013627	eng	Just answer my question.
4013644	eng	So what's the prognosis?
4013675	eng	It's not physically possible.
4013676	eng	Maybe it's not possible.
4013682	eng	That shouldn't be possible.
4013688	eng	That's a real possibility.
4013693	eng	Where's the swimming pool?
4013704	eng	What an unexpected pleasure!
4013732	eng	Would you leave, please?
4013777	eng	Who's running this place?
4013816	eng	Who's this other patient?
4013862	eng	Now you're being paranoid.
4013872	eng	It's obviously very painful.
4013883	eng	This meeting isn't over.
4013898	eng	Can you wait outside?
4013900	eng	Take that stuff outside.
4013948	eng	There are three options.
4013951	eng	There are always options.
4013952	eng	There's no better option.
4013964	eng	Where's the bottle opener?
4014037	eng	It's so painfully obvious.
4014040	eng	What's Tom's office number?
4014056	eng	What's the situation now?
4014115	eng	What'll we do now?
4014124	eng	I'm in charge now.
4014159	eng	What's that horrible noise?
4014221	eng	That's not really necessary.
4014222	eng	That isn't really necessary.
4014223	eng	That's no longer necessary.
4014224	eng	It's no longer necessary.
4014226	eng	That probably isn't necessary.
4014264	eng	Does it hurt much?
4014305	eng	Tom counted the money.
4014309	eng	Tom counted his money.
4014427	eng	It's well after midnight.
4014489	eng	What's your earliest memory?
4014523	eng	Where was the meeting?
4014541	eng	Please quit bothering me.
4014638	eng	What caused the malfunction?
4014649	eng	Tom didn't seem mad.
4014671	eng	Maybe there's a loophole.
4014686	eng	This shouldn't take long.
4014749	eng	What's Tom look like?
4014753	eng	It's compact and lightweight.
4014760	eng	There's plenty of light.
4014797	eng	There's hardly anything left.
4014799	eng	Everyone has already left.
4014854	eng	It's getting pretty late.
4014855	eng	It's kind of late.
4014901	eng	Three hostages were killed.
4014904	eng	Who's the strongest kid?
4014905	eng	Who's watching the kids?
4014918	eng	Here, use my key.
4014949	eng	Tom sounded slightly jealous.
4015120	eng	Why wasn't Tom invited?
4015121	eng	Why wasn't I invited?
4015126	eng	Tom was our interpreter.
4015129	eng	That was very interesting.
4015136	eng	It was truly inspirational.
4015141	eng	Please come back inside.
4015154	eng	This place is incredible.
4015162	eng	It's really quite impressive.
4015163	eng	Tom seemed very impressed.
4015166	eng	It's not very important.
4015167	eng	It's very, very important.
4015170	eng	It's really not important.
4015177	eng	This is definitely illegal.
4015215	eng	Someone could get hurt.
4015220	eng	I'm not that hungry.
4015263	eng	It's definitely getting hotter.
4015280	eng	Tom finished his homework.
4015306	eng	How's everything back home?
4015388	eng	There's usually someone here.
4015392	eng	I'll wait right here.
4015415	eng	There's obviously nobody here.
4015421	eng	Someone's meeting me here.
4015438	eng	It's creepy in here.
4015442	eng	It's depressing in here.
4015466	eng	Tom is finally here.
4015518	eng	Maybe therapy would help.
4015540	eng	Perhaps Tom needs help.
4015541	eng	Maybe Tom needs help.
4015547	eng	This isn't really helping.
4015578	eng	These suitcases are heavy.
4015643	eng	Tom isn't very handsome.
4015645	eng	Tom thinks he's handsome.
4015647	eng	Tom bandaged Mary's hand.
4015669	eng	Maybe Tom is guilty.
4015673	eng	There's a money-back guarantee.
4015680	eng	Do you have grandchildren?
4015728	eng	How's your summer going?
4015742	eng	Put on your gloves.
4015768	eng	You should quit gambling.
4015779	eng	This really isn't funny.
4015800	eng	Everyone here is friendly.
4015805	eng	Can Tom understand French?
4015824	eng	These are very fragile.
4015883	eng	This could take forever.
4015885	eng	What's the champagne for?
4015902	eng	This plan is fool-proof.
4015917	eng	These are beautiful flowers.
4015939	eng	It's still not finished.
4015974	eng	That name sounds familiar.
4015979	eng	Perhaps it's a fake.
4015980	eng	Maybe it's a fake.
4015989	eng	There's a better explanation.
4015997	eng	It's impossible to explain.
4016015	eng	There are several exits.
4016024	eng	What's that mean exactly?
4016035	eng	This could change everything.
4016036	eng	There's plenty for everyone.
4016037	eng	Thanks for calling everyone.
4016040	eng	Have you met everybody?
4016054	eng	There's a back entrance.
4016056	eng	Maybe that's not enough.
4016059	eng	That should've been enough.
4016067	eng	It's kind of embarrassing.
4016081	eng	Does water conduct electricity?
4016096	eng	This should be easy.
4016101	eng	Where's your other earring?
4016107	eng	Tom must've left early.
4016118	eng	Who's the better driver?
4016146	eng	Tom came back downstairs.
4016147	eng	Things have slowed down.
4016156	eng	Things have calmed down.
4016376	eng	It's kind of disgusting.
4016377	eng	This place is disgusting.
4016383	eng	There's room for discussion.
4016411	eng	That shouldn't be difficult.
4016415	eng	Why is everything different?
4016418	eng	There are minor differences.
4016461	eng	It's difficult to describe.
4016465	eng	This mango is delicious.
4016472	eng	It's the right decision.
4016533	eng	There's no other damage.
4016537	eng	It's an old custom.
4016544	eng	Why is everybody crying?
4016552	eng	Did the plane crash?
4016566	eng	That's not entirely correct.
4016577	eng	That wasn't very convincing.
4016590	eng	Tom must've been confused.
4016592	eng	These aren't ideal conditions.
4016593	eng	What's the other condition?
4016607	eng	It's kind of complicated.
4016608	eng	Tom hardly ever complains.
4016610	eng	Where's the welcoming committee?
4016618	eng	Thanks again for coming.
4016628	eng	Tom likes romantic comedies.
4016634	eng	What an amazing coincidence!
4016651	eng	There's plenty of coffee.
4016656	eng	What's the emergency code?
4016657	eng	Is that Tom's coat?
4016674	eng	Why's the restaurant closed?
4016678	eng	Things aren't too clear.
4016704	eng	What's your second choice?
4016706	eng	That's an interesting choice.
4016745	eng	That's quite a challenge.
4016746	eng	Are you absolutely certain?
4016757	eng	There were no casualties.
4016758	eng	There might be casualties.
4016759	eng	Were there any casualties?
4016764	eng	Is that Tom's car?
4016783	eng	All right, listen carefully.
4016785	eng	Where was Tom captured?
4016805	eng	What's that thing called?
4016834	eng	Where's your other brother?
4016850	eng	It's made of brass.
4016914	eng	These are beautiful bookcases.
4016924	eng	It's obviously a bluff.
4016927	eng	It smells like bleach.
4016928	eng	What's under the blanket?
4016999	eng	We're ready to begin.
4017016	eng	This wasn't here before.
4017054	eng	Where's the nearest bathroom?
4017078	eng	We'll call you back.
4017089	eng	When's Tom expected back?
4017091	eng	Thanks for calling back.
4017095	eng	This stuff tastes awful.
4017107	eng	It's probably still available.
4017128	eng	That's a reasonable assumption.
4017165	eng	That sounds really appealing.
4017170	eng	Please accept our apologies.
4017203	eng	This isn't helping anything.
4017227	eng	This isn't funny anymore.
4017237	eng	There's no other answer.
4017242	eng	Tom didn't seem angry.
4017328	eng	There's that sound again.
4017379	eng	It's quite complex actually.
4017380	eng	It's quite common actually.
4017381	eng	That's not completely accurate.
4017394	eng	There's been another accident.
4017429	eng	What's the meeting about?
4017456	eng	It's on page 3.
4021410	eng	Go to the shop.
4021916	eng	He's a brown noser.
4022418	eng	Tom is nervous, too.
4022698	eng	Tom's father retired early.
4024998	eng	Dan attended Oxford University.
4025269	eng	What do you read?
4025280	eng	Mary visited her grandmother.
4025320	eng	Where is your child?
4025892	eng	Linda wore no make-up.
4026108	eng	I'm not rejecting you.
4026545	eng	The wind is shifting.
4027764	eng	Dan is a linguist.
4028182	eng	Dan and Linda reconciled.
4028188	eng	Dan angrily attacked Linda.
4028533	eng	Dan babysat Linda's children.
4029726	eng	He's a little fat.
4030094	eng	What else is on?
4030770	eng	I share your sorrow.
4030772	eng	Please receive my condolences.
4030801	eng	The food looks tasty.
4031936	eng	They tell you this.
4032226	eng	To hell with it!
4033688	eng	Have faith in God.
4035884	eng	I don't like spiders.
4036787	eng	After that, what happened?
4036892	eng	The city is asleep.
4036990	eng	Hi, are you Tom?
4037044	eng	Tom studies at Harvard.
4037046	eng	Tom isn't really happy.
4037326	eng	I'm not applauding you.
4038260	eng	Do you like figure-skating?
4038350	eng	The boys are shy.
4039795	eng	Coloring eggs is fun.
4040660	eng	Everybody has a desire.
4042216	eng	She dresses herself quickly.
4042271	eng	I'm making scrambled eggs.
4042309	eng	What's your favorite prayer?
4042336	eng	He bought some rice.
4042344	eng	The house is red.
4042356	eng	They saw the ship.
4042364	eng	Harriet looked slightly abashed.
4042769	eng	She cleaned the house.
4043293	eng	We all like you.
4044341	eng	I should learn French.
4046002	eng	My parents are quarrelling.
4046118	eng	He's renting the room.
4046144	eng	That wasn't very clever.
4046161	eng	Swimming strengthens the legs.
4046436	eng	We fed the dog.
4046547	eng	I think I'm resolute.
4046661	eng	My brother likes cars.
4046724	eng	I will be late.
4046754	eng	Are you working today?
4046980	eng	It is very fast.
4047361	eng	What is cultural appropriation?
4048959	eng	Tom corroborated Mary's story.
4048960	eng	Tom closed the store.
4048961	eng	What's in this stew?
4048962	eng	Where's the train station?
4048969	eng	He fired his secretary.
4049008	eng	The light is perfect.
4049063	eng	They moved in recently.
4049064	eng	They moved here recently.
4050164	eng	Nobody likes attention whores.
4050347	eng	She's about my age.
4051669	eng	You have beautiful lips.
4052490	eng	It's evil to curse.
4054536	eng	I greased Tom's palm.
4054617	eng	What is our weather?
4054683	eng	There's no point panicking.
4054937	eng	Which car is Tom's?
4054946	eng	Can we trust you?
4054976	eng	Don't be embarrassed, Tom.
4055102	eng	Yeah, something like that.
4055526	eng	People are dumb animals.
4056722	eng	Which one is right?
4057597	eng	Tom improved his results.
4057613	eng	Did it snow yesterday?
4057616	eng	Tom wasn't here yesterday.
4057620	eng	Tom heard Mary yelling.
4059006	eng	Tom soon fell asleep.
4059014	eng	Tom wants Mary back.
4060114	eng	Esperanto has no exceptions.
4060128	eng	I will learn Esperanto.
4060138	eng	What are we after?
4060435	eng	The escalator suddenly stopped.
4061261	eng	Between continents are oceans.
4061399	eng	He'd rather come tomorrow.
4061547	eng	Yup, I am angry.
4061552	eng	The printer doesn't work.
4061555	eng	Is Tom still working?
4061750	eng	Tom is a sommelier.
4062574	eng	That's a provocative pose.
4062855	eng	Tom ignored my advice.
4062861	eng	Don't interrupt me again.
4062867	eng	Tom left me alone.
4062876	eng	Aren't you missing anyone?
4062880	eng	When does Tom arrive?
4062887	eng	I love fried bananas.
4062892	eng	Do you play basketball?
4062923	eng	Why must I suffer?
4063473	eng	I can fake it.
4063925	eng	Dinner isn't ready yet.
4063926	eng	Aren't you tired yet?
4064448	eng	There are holidays soon.
4065083	eng	Tom, it's your mother.
4066040	eng	I love lentil soup.
4066366	eng	Germans mustn't help them.
4066562	eng	Tom was completely shocked.
4066622	eng	It was totally random.
4066630	eng	I was really curious.
4066631	eng	He's thinking really hard.
4066632	eng	She's thinking really hard.
4067172	eng	Tom might have cancer.
4068049	eng	I performed your task.
4068858	eng	The ambassador died suddenly.
4069197	eng	I negotiated the price.
4069225	eng	You are washing dishes.
4070859	eng	I should call you.
4071441	eng	Sentence mixing is funny.
4071463	eng	Word splicing is funny.
4073158	eng	You're about to cry.
4073188	eng	Where is the hammer?
4073321	eng	I don't like beer.
4073332	eng	This is so confusing.
4073338	eng	There's room for improvement.
4073370	eng	The writer is writing.
4073374	eng	They say she died.
4073375	eng	They say she's dead.
4073382	eng	Short sentences are better.
4073398	eng	The situation seems hopeless.
4073406	eng	The soup is hot.
4073434	eng	That cannot be denied.
4073896	eng	Who should we believe?
4073898	eng	Which is the best?
4073900	eng	Tom borrowed my bike.
4074363	eng	What's in that bottle?
4076426	eng	The mistakes are mine.
4076762	eng	Did Tom like Boston?
4076776	eng	Tom talked about Boston.
4076860	eng	When is Cheryl’s birthday?
4077307	eng	Where's the mail box?
4077426	eng	Tom's wife is Canadian.
4077427	eng	Tom isn't really Canadian.
4078980	eng	Why do cows ruminate?
4079121	eng	"Later" is a lie.
4079239	eng	The TV is broken.
4079240	eng	Bring me my cane.
4079376	eng	The girl is writing.
4079380	eng	The girl is Irish.
4079761	eng	Tom borrowed my car.
4079768	eng	I don't like cats.
4080006	eng	I wasn't thinking clearly.
4080007	eng	It's simple, but beautiful.
4080043	eng	I learned something today.
4080436	eng	I loved only Mary.
4080626	eng	I hate two-faced communities.
4080629	eng	I hate hypocritical communities.
4080644	eng	Institutions mustn't tell lies.
4080739	eng	I can't forget Mary.
4080948	eng	Tom's room wasn't clean.
4081352	eng	Here is our guarantee.
4081547	eng	He was having fun.
4083542	eng	The sky's getting darker.
4083625	eng	I'm dying to know.
4083732	eng	Mary is very cute.
4084472	eng	She unbraided her hair.
4084630	eng	Water pipes are cylinders.
4086739	eng	My little toe hurts.
4086898	eng	Has Tom calmed down?
4089872	eng	Bill resisted the temptation.
4090002	eng	Please wait for me.
4091295	eng	Get off of me.
4091298	eng	Tom didn't remember me.
4091700	eng	I have four children.
4091839	eng	He has enormous potential.
4091843	eng	Soap can clean grime.
4091861	eng	Do you feel bored?
4091889	eng	A kitten was born.
4091901	eng	Wine helps with digestion.
4092482	eng	No one warned me.
4092771	eng	She always arrives early.
4093777	eng	That's the first option.
4097481	eng	I must work tonight.
4097489	eng	Persian is not hard.
4097508	eng	Did everyone go crazy?
4097542	eng	Can you get that?
4097550	eng	The more the better.
4097551	eng	The faster, the better.
4097971	eng	I need one apple.
4098153	eng	When's the last ferry?
4098462	eng	I was not lonely.

4494039	eng	Those things are irrelevant.
4494040	eng	Those factors are important.
4494041	eng	This is fundamentally wrong.
4494042	eng	They were very professional.
4494044	eng	These are expensive tickets.
4494045	eng	There's not much difference.
4494046	eng	There was debris everywhere.
4494047	eng	The stripes were horizontal.
4494048	eng	The pressure was tremendous.
4494049	eng	The pontoons are detachable.
4494050	eng	The neighborhood was silent.
4494051	eng	The losses are incalculable.
4494052	eng	That would be irresponsible.
4494053	eng	That would be extraordinary.
4494058	eng	It was definitely different.
4494059	eng	Is your toddler hyperactive?
4494062	eng	Everything was so beautiful.
4494063	eng	Everything was pretty equal.
4494065	eng	Deer are fairly intelligent.
4494067	eng	Are those people terrorists?
4494068	eng	Wouldn't that be fantastic?
4494070	eng	What were the alternatives?
4494071	eng	What are the possibilities?
4494073	eng	Violators will be ticketed.
4494074	eng	Tom's trial resumes Monday.
4494075	eng	Tom's technique was sloppy.
4494079	eng	Tom was very compassionate.
4494087	eng	Tickets are tax deductible.
4494088	eng	Tickets are available here.
4494091	eng	This would be catastrophic.
4494092	eng	This is very inappropriate.

4494097	eng	They were very considerate.
4494098	eng	These things are expensive.
4494099	eng	These bottles are reusable.
4494100	eng	There's one big difference.

4494118	eng	Shuttles will be available.
4494120	eng	Rabbits are social animals.
4494121	eng	Perhaps it was coincidence.
4494122	eng	People are inherently good.
4494123	eng	No batteries are necessary.
4494124	eng	Monday morning was typical.
4494125	eng	It's a hostile environment.
4494127	eng	It was totally unnecessary.
4494128	eng	It was pretty discouraging.
4494129	eng	How sophisticated are they?
4494130	eng	Fathers aren't the problem.
4494131	eng	Everything is so expensive.
4494132	eng	Everything is really great.
4494133	eng	Each business is different.
4494134	eng	Corruption is still common.
4494136	eng	Australia was no exception.
4494137	eng	Australia was an exception.

4494161	eng	Things are expensive here.
4494162	eng	Things are different here.
4494163	eng	They were terribly hungry.

4494185	eng	Something is strange here.
4494186	eng	Some truths are universal.
4494187	eng	Our resources are limited.
4494188	eng	Obviously that isn't true.
4494189	eng	Nothing else is important.
4494193	eng	Many people are skeptical.
4494196	eng	It's definitely good news.
4494198	eng	It was our responsibility.
4494199	eng	Is your neighborhood safe?
4494200	eng	Is this really newsworthy?
4494203	eng	Everybody should be proud.
4494204	eng	Everybody is hungry again.
4494207	eng	Australia is no exception.
4494208	eng	Australia is no different.
4494210	eng	Another problem is safety.
4494211	eng	Why is history important?
4494212	eng	What are your priorities?

4494234	eng	This story is ridiculous.
4494235	eng	This is beyond ludicrous.
4494236	eng	They're right, of course.
4494237	eng	They were very assertive.
4494238	eng	They were good opponents.
4494239	eng	They were from Australia.
4494240	eng	They were all hysterical.
4494241	eng	These are serious issues.
4494242	eng	There's nobody else here.
4494243	eng	There's an easy solution.
4494244	eng	There were no newspapers.
4494245	eng	There were no fatalities.

4494255	eng	The news was devastating.
4494257	eng	The mirror was shattered.
4494259	eng	The competition is stiff.
4494260	eng	That's not Tom's problem.
4494261	eng	That would be ridiculous.
4494262	eng	That would be courageous.
4494264	eng	Some things are personal.
4494265	eng	Our priorities are wrong.
4494266	eng	Our neighborhood is safe.
4494268	eng	Obviously, Tom was right.
4494269	eng	Now things are different.
4494271	eng	No antidote is available.
4494272	eng	Maybe Tom was distracted.
4494273	eng	Life is unfair sometimes.
4494276	eng	It's a worldwide problem.
4494277	eng	It wasn't that different.

4494279	eng	It was strictly business.
4494285	eng	Everything was so pretty.
4494286	eng	Everything was brand new.
4494287	eng	Everybody is so friendly.
4494288	eng	Every woman is different.
4494289	eng	Corruption was a problem.
4494290	eng	Cops can't be everywhere.

4494292	eng	Baseball is big business.
4494294	eng	Are you against abortion?

4494300	eng	You're the pathetic one.
4494301	eng	Why is that unfortunate?
4494302	eng	Why aren't you outraged?
4494304	eng	Where is everybody from?
4494305	eng	Violators will be fined.

4494357	eng	Someone is always there.
4494358	eng	People are really angry.
4494359	eng	Medication is an option.
4494362	eng	Maybe that's the secret.
4494363	eng	Lunch will be available.
4494364	eng	It's not that different.
4494366	eng	It's kind of comforting.

4494371	eng	It was relatively quiet.
4494372	eng	It was really fantastic.
4494373	eng	It was pretty dangerous.

4494380	eng	Is this really possible?
4494381	eng	Is it really recyclable?
4494382	eng	Is everyone still alive?
4494383	eng	Insomnia is very common.

4494398	eng	Wouldn't that be great?
4494399	eng	Will that be difficult?
4494401	eng	Why is that ridiculous?
4494402	eng	Who are the candidates?
4494403	eng	Which is your favorite?
4494404	eng	What were the symptoms?
4494405	eng	What was your favorite?

4496827	eng	It's a huge concern.
4496829	eng	Is that a concern?
4496831	eng	The results are inconclusive.
4496832	eng	The results were conclusive.
4496833	eng	That concludes our business.

4496881	eng	Construction is already underway.
4496885	eng	Please contact Tom directly.
4496886	eng	Tom couldn't be contacted.
4496887	eng	I like contact sports.

4496892	eng	Police continued their investigation.
4496894	eng	Discussions will continue tomorrow.

4496913	eng	Tom was sobbing uncontrollably.
4496914	eng	Pollution can be controlled.
4496925	eng	Convincing Tom was difficult.
4496928	eng	Does that sound convincing?
4496929	eng	Tom couldn't be convinced.
4496936	eng	Tom really enjoys cooking.
4496937	eng	Is that already cooked?
4496939	eng	I hate your cooking.
4496941	eng	How did you cope?
4496943	eng	This information is incorrect.
4496944	eng	Tom was absolutely correct.
4496945	eng	Tom is absolutely correct.

4496952	eng	Tom is 100% correct.
4496955	eng	No correlation was found.
4496961	eng	That would reduce costs.
4496963	eng	The costs kept rising.
4496964	eng	What'll it cost me?
4496965	eng	What was the cost?
4496966	eng	It can be costly.
4496967	eng	Tom coughed all night.
4497033	eng	This could happen anywhere.
4497036	eng	Could we start immediately?
4497037	eng	Could the situation worsen?
4497038	eng	Anything could happen here.
4497040	eng	They couldn't be stopped.

4497044	eng	Tom couldn't be reached.
4497045	eng	Tom couldn't be located.
4497046	eng	Stock prices could fall.
4497047	eng	Could you rephrase that?
4497048	eng	Tom could return today.
4497049	eng	Tom could replace Mary.
4497050	eng	Things could get worse.
4497052	eng	Could you wait outside?

4497066	eng	We could do better.
4497067	eng	Tom could be there.
4497068	eng	I could almost cry.
4497069	eng	How could I refuse?
4497071	eng	No one could work.
4497072	eng	It could get ugly.
4497073	eng	What could we do?
4497076	eng	Does their opinion count?
4497081	eng	Crack is very addictive.
4497087	eng	Creativity is the key.
4497088	eng	Tom criticized the photo.
4497089	eng	They often criticize us.

4498474	eng	Tom hid his face.
4498476	eng	The terrorists have failed.
4498477	eng	We have failed miserably.
4498478	eng	Can Tom handle failure?
4498479	eng	Tom failed the test.

4498734	eng	I'm afraid of flying.
4498737	eng	I followed Tom home.
4498739	eng	I follow the rules.
4498741	eng	What a foolish suggestion!

4498786	eng	I gained three pounds.
4498788	eng	The gamble paid off.
4498789	eng	It's a huge gamble.
4498790	eng	It was a gamble.
4498791	eng	People are gathering outside.
4498792	eng	Tom lowered his gaze.
4498850	eng	This should get interesting.

4498937	eng	That gives me hope.
4498938	eng	Give me your watch.
4498939	eng	Give me the phone.
4498940	eng	I almost gave up.
4498990	eng	Everything went very smoothly.
4498998	eng	The operation went smoothly.

4499077	eng	Several grants are available.
4499078	eng	There are grants available.
4499082	eng	The ground started shaking.
4499083	eng	The ground is spongy.
4499087	eng	Our children are grown.
4499088	eng	Grow up a little.
4499090	eng	I can guarantee it.
4499091	eng	Guard duty is boring.
4499092	eng	Be on your guard.
4499094	eng	My guess was right.
4499098	eng	Nobody handed Tom anything.
4499100	eng	Pull your hand out.
4499101	eng	How are complaints handled?
4499102	eng	Tom handled it perfectly.

4499112	eng	Hang in there, guys.
4499113	eng	We hung in there.
4499114	eng	Tom then hung up.
4499141	eng	Unfortunately, that hasn't happened.
4499143	eng	Whatever happened to individualism?
4499149	eng	Whatever happened to competition?
4499150	eng	Unfortunately, that won't happen.
4499152	eng	Apparently, nothing bad happened.
4499155	eng	Nothing of consequence happened.
4499156	eng	Everything happened so quickly.
4499157	eng	Maybe something else happened.
4499158	eng	Those things really happened.
4499159	eng	Hopefully, that won't happen.
4499161	eng	That happened just recently.
4499162	eng	Sometimes that just happens.
4499165	eng	That wouldn't happen today.
4499168	eng	It never actually happened.
4499169	eng	I understand what happened.
4499170	eng	Everyone saw what happened.

4499195	eng	These things can happen.
4499196	eng	That would never happen.
4499197	eng	That won't happen today.
4499198	eng	That happened last week.
4499199	eng	It has already happened.
4499200	eng	It all happened quickly.
4499201	eng	Is that still happening?
4499202	eng	Will that happen again?
4499203	eng	What on earth happened?
4499204	eng	What happens this week?
4499205	eng	What happened that day?

4499214	eng	That happened in 2013.
4499215	eng	Not too much happened.
4499216	eng	It might never happen.
4499217	eng	It has never happened.
4499224	eng	Has that happened yet?
4499225	eng	Can this happen again?
4499226	eng	Will it happen again?
4499230	eng	That happens in life.
4499231	eng	So much is happening.
4499233	eng	Let's make it happen.
4499238	eng	It may never happen.
4499239	eng	It happened in 2013.
4499240	eng	It can happen again.
4499241	eng	How can that happen?
4499243	eng	Tom made it happen.
4499245	eng	It can happen here.
4499246	eng	Can it happen here?
4499247	eng	I saw that happen.
4499249	eng	It had to happen.
4499251	eng	Tom meant no harm.
4499252	eng	Not everyone hates Tom.
4499253	eng	Everyone else hates us.
4499254	eng	They hated being here.
4499255	eng	Tom hates that word.
4499256	eng	Who else hates Tom?
4499257	eng	Tom's dog hated me.
4499258	eng	They hate our guts.
4499259	eng	I hated that movie.

4499266	eng	I really hate it.
4499267	eng	I just hate them.
4499269	eng	I hate that word.
4499270	eng	Everyone shook their heads.
4499271	eng	Where was Tom heading?
4499272	eng	Some wounds never heal.
4499281	eng	We heard screaming outside.
4499282	eng	I heard three explosions.
4499283	eng	We heard three shots.
4499284	eng	Tom heard the scream.
4499285	eng	Can everyone hear me?
4499290	eng	Crank up the heater.
4499302	eng	Everybody needs help sometimes.
4499308	eng	Would a postponement help?
4499309	eng	We need help immediately.
4499310	eng	Tom loved helping people.
4499312	eng	The medication helped me.
4499313	eng	I think experience helps.
4499315	eng	Someone yelled for help.
4499316	eng	Somebody please help me.
4499319	eng	Tom helped rescue Mary.
4499320	eng	This is very unhelpful.
4499322	eng	They have enough help.
4499323	eng	Nobody ever helped us.
4499324	eng	Maybe this would help.

4499376	eng	Thanks for hiring me.
4499377	eng	They should hire me.
4499378	eng	Should we hire Tom?
4499381	eng	Tom scored three hits.
4499382	eng	Tom kept hitting me.
4499383	eng	It suddenly hit me.
4499405	eng	We certainly hope not.
4499409	eng	I sincerely hope not.
4499410	eng	I hope you're joking.
4499411	eng	I certainly hope not.
4499413	eng	Maybe there is hope.
4499414	eng	I suddenly had hope.
4499415	eng	I hope Tom survives.
4499416	eng	I never lost hope.
4499417	eng	I truly hope not.

4499442	eng	It hurt me deeply.
4499443	eng	It hurts to move.
4499631	eng	I immediately stopped laughing.
4499646	eng	Tom's attitude infuriates me.
4499652	eng	Nothing surprises me anymore.
4499653	eng	Nothing interests me anymore.
4499667	eng	I would recommend otherwise.
4499668	eng	I understand your situation.
4499669	eng	I understand Tom's position.
4499678	eng	Where are my grandchildren?
4499680	eng	That was my recommendation.
4499681	eng	That actually surprised me.
4499683	eng	Someone deleted my comment.
4499685	eng	My stepfather was diabetic.
4499690	eng	I wasn't really interested.
4499691	eng	I was really uncomfortable.

4499696	eng	I take full responsibility.
4499697	eng	I scoured the neighborhood.
4499703	eng	Please respect my privacy.
4499707	eng	I think it's unreasonable.
4499710	eng	I love playing basketball.
4499712	eng	I exacerbated the problem.
4499713	eng	I definitely recommend it.
4499715	eng	I am pleasantly surprised.
4499716	eng	Desserts are my specialty.
4499723	eng	That really intrigues me.
4499724	eng	Thanks for supporting me.
4499725	eng	My strength has improved.
4499726	eng	I'll be forever grateful.
4499728	eng	I was pretty overwhelmed.
4499729	eng	I was incredibly unlucky.
4499731	eng	I unholstered my firearm.
4499732	eng	I understood the message.
4499733	eng	I understand the premise.
4499734	eng	I understand Tom's point.
4499736	eng	I think it's disgraceful.
4499737	eng	I think everybody's here.
4499738	eng	I see things differently.
4499741	eng	I really love basketball.
4499745	eng	I know that neighborhood.
4499748	eng	I definitely was shocked.
4499749	eng	Tom stole my girlfriend.

4499751	eng	Thanks for notifying me.
4499752	eng	Obviously, I was scared.
4499754	eng	My heart started racing.
4499755	eng	My curiosity was piqued.
4499756	eng	It really aggravated me.
4499757	eng	I'm still not impressed.
4499759	eng	I'm a preschool teacher.
4499764	eng	I was extremely nervous.
4499766	eng	I understand your point.
4499767	eng	I understand the issues.

4499773	eng	I remain very confident.
4499774	eng	I really like traveling.
4499775	eng	I never understood that.
4499776	eng	I never lost confidence.
4499778	eng	I love Tom's enthusiasm.
4499779	eng	I listened to everybody.
4499781	eng	I have dual citizenship.
4499783	eng	I fully understand that.
4499784	eng	Everyone wished me luck.
4499787	eng	Tom refused my request.
4499788	eng	Tom really inspired me.
4499790	eng	They took me seriously.
4499791	eng	These are my favorites.
4499792	eng	That was my motivation.
4499795	eng	My brothers protect me.
4499796	eng	My brother lives there.
4499797	eng	It really surprised me.
4499798	eng	I've already seen this.
4499800	eng	I worked alongside Tom.
4499801	eng	I was truly astonished.

4499806	eng	I was really fortunate.
4499807	eng	I was pretty surprised.
4499808	eng	I was pretty confident.
4499810	eng	I was nearly paralyzed.
4499811	eng	I was incredibly lucky.
4499812	eng	I was definitely wrong.
4499813	eng	I was absolutely right.
4499815	eng	I wanted something new.
4499816	eng	I value their opinions.
4499819	eng	I think it's hilarious.
4499820	eng	I squeezed the trigger.
4499821	eng	I smell something foul.
4499822	eng	I should've phoned Tom.
4499823	eng	I see the similarities.
4499824	eng	I remember being there.

4499838	eng	Tom invited me inside.
4499840	eng	Tom also impressed me.
4499841	eng	Those are my children.
4499842	eng	This makes me nervous.
4499843	eng	That was my intention.
4499845	eng	Sometimes I have pain.
4499846	eng	Nobody can replace me.
4499847	eng	My mom's the greatest.
4499848	eng	I've said this before.
4499849	eng	I've said that before.
4499851	eng	I won the scholarship.
4499852	eng	I wasn't even nervous.
4499853	eng	I was very idealistic.
4499854	eng	I was truly impressed.
4499855	eng	I was pretty gullible.
4499856	eng	I was extremely tired.
4499857	eng	I was extremely proud.
4499858	eng	I was extremely lucky.

4499865	eng	I sincerely mean that.
4499866	eng	I personally like Tom.
4499867	eng	I never plan anything.
4499869	eng	I made some inquiries.
4499870	eng	I love that tradition.
4499871	eng	I love scaring people.
4499873	eng	I immediately said no.
4499874	eng	I highly recommend it.
4499875	eng	I have no alternative.
4499877	eng	I definitely think so.
4499878	eng	I can understand this.
4499879	eng	How can I participate?
4499883	eng	They wanted me there.
4499885	eng	That just baffles me.
4499886	eng	Thank God I survived.
4499887	eng	Please send me money.
4499888	eng	People left me alone.
4499890	eng	My parents are great.
4499891	eng	My palms were sweaty.
4499893	eng	Luckily, I was wrong.
4499894	eng	Let me rephrase that.
4499896	eng	I'm friends with Tom.
4499897	eng	I'd rather stay home.
4499898	eng	I worried, of course.
4499899	eng	I was very skeptical.
4499900	eng	I was very confident.
4499901	eng	I was really shocked.
4499902	eng	I was pretty shocked.
4499903	eng	I was pretty nervous.
4499904	eng	I was just wondering.
4499905	eng	I was just fortunate.
4499907	eng	I want your feedback.
4499908	eng	I thought about that.
4499909	eng	I still remember you.
4499910	eng	I stated the obvious.
4499911	eng	I should be studying.

4499937	eng	I deeply regret that.
4499938	eng	I can only speculate.
4499939	eng	I can always improve.
4499942	eng	Where are my gloves?
4499944	eng	That suited me fine.
4499945	eng	Tell me about those.
4499946	eng	Talk to my attorney.
4499947	eng	My heart was racing.
4499948	eng	My goals are modest.
4499949	eng	My father warned me.
4499950	eng	My country needs me.
4499951	eng	Music is my passion.
4499954	eng	I'm bored with that.
4499955	eng	I was pretty scared.
4499956	eng	I was outraged, too.
4499957	eng	I unlocked the door.
4499958	eng	I took Tom's advice.
4499959	eng	I think they'll win.
4499960	eng	I think it's simple.
4499961	eng	I studied very hard.
4499962	eng	I still write songs.
4499963	eng	I sprained my ankle.
4499964	eng	I sleep pretty well.
4499965	eng	I should be jealous.

4499978	eng	I have the solution.
4499979	eng	I have no questions.
4499981	eng	I had one advantage.
4499982	eng	I daydream about it.
4499983	eng	I actually like Tom.
4499984	eng	Boy, was I mistaken.
4499985	eng	Baseball is my life.
4499986	eng	Tom stole my heart.
4499987	eng	They stuck with me.
4499988	eng	That makes me sick.
4499989	eng	People like my mom.
4499991	eng	My heart just sank.
4499993	eng	My eyes were tired.
4499994	eng	My bedroom is dark.
4499995	eng	My arms are aching.
4499996	eng	It makes me wonder.
4499999	eng	I was very nervous.

4500008	eng	I wanted to scream.
4500009	eng	I want this guitar.
4500010	eng	I want the blanket.
4500013	eng	I thought that, too.
4500014	eng	I think it's wrong.
4500016	eng	I second that idea.
4500017	eng	I scanned the room.
4500018	eng	I saw that tonight.
4500020	eng	I remember it, too.
4500021	eng	I really missed it.

4500042	eng	I actually like it.
4500044	eng	Are my children OK?
4500045	eng	You make me laugh.
4500046	eng	Where will I live?
4500047	eng	Tom was my mentor.
4500048	eng	They took my baby.
4500050	eng	They made me wait.
4500051	eng	That's OK with me.
4500052	eng	That works for me.
4500053	eng	That was my lunch.
4500054	eng	Now I know better.
4500055	eng	My office is tiny.
4500056	eng	My heart is yours.

4500065	eng	I was so homesick.
4500066	eng	I was really lost.
4500067	eng	I was quite upset.
4500069	eng	I wanted to laugh.
4500070	eng	I want to survive.
4500071	eng	I want a discount.
4500072	eng	I truly mean that.
4500073	eng	I think it's cool.
4500074	eng	I see you nodding.
4500075	eng	I saw the package.
4500076	eng	I saw that report.
4500077	eng	I really liked it.
4500078	eng	I missed the putt.
4500079	eng	I miss your smile.
4500080	eng	I miss those days.
4500081	eng	I loved the movie.

4500098	eng	Will you miss me?
4500099	eng	When can I train?
4500100	eng	Tom talked to me.
4500101	eng	Tom relies on me.
4500102	eng	Tom is my mentor.
4500103	eng	This is my rifle.
4500104	eng	This is my child.
4500105	eng	They know I know.
4500106	eng	That was my goal.
4500107	eng	My toes are numb.
4500108	eng	Is this my fault?
4500109	eng	I'm not the boss.
4500110	eng	I'm a hockey fan.
4500111	eng	I'm a Giants fan.
4500112	eng	I work full time.
4500113	eng	I wish them luck.
4500114	eng	I was very upset.
4500115	eng	I was very lucky.

4500124	eng	I was a criminal.
4500125	eng	I waited a month.
4500126	eng	I think Tom knew.
4500127	eng	I suffered a lot.
4500128	eng	I still think so.

4502995	eng	Nobody should be worried.
4502996	eng	Why aren't they worried?
4502997	eng	Not everyone is worried.
4502998	eng	What are your worries?
4502999	eng	Tom should be worried.
4503000	eng	Should Tom be worried?
4503001	eng	Should we be worried?

4513841	eng	They took my ring.
4513964	eng	She was painfully shy.
4514477	eng	I updated your software.

4527675	eng	Six squared is thirty-six.
4529389	eng	Tom should've apologized instantly.
4529432	eng	Tom's achievements are impressive.
4529455	eng	Something unexpected has happened.
4529511	eng	Here's an important announcement.

4529524	eng	We're anticipating more charges.
4529529	eng	Tom's decision shocked everyone.
4529536	eng	Tom seemed pleasantly surprised.
4529584	eng	You've been amazingly tolerant.
4529595	eng	Tom would've heartily agreed.
4529620	eng	That's quite an accomplishment.
4529705	eng	I appreciated the opportunity.
4529722	eng	We weren't allowed backstage.
4529732	eng	Tom looks somewhat irritated.
4529745	eng	They rejected my application.
4529755	eng	That's a huge accomplishment.
4529778	eng	Everyone nodded in agreement.

4529809	eng	That's quite an achievement.
4529811	eng	That strategy hasn't worked.
4529813	eng	It's an amazing opportunity.

4529959	eng	Pets aren't allowed here.
4529976	eng	I felt incredibly stupid.
4529987	eng	You need an appointment.
4529988	eng	You may need assistance.
4529991	eng	Why wasn't Tom arrested?
4530004	eng	Tom shouldn't have lied.
4530010	eng	Tom doesn't like onions.
4530014	eng	Tom addressed the crowd.
4530016	eng	That's a bad assumption.
4530020	eng	Nobody knows the answer.
4530025	eng	I'm not advocating that.
4530034	eng	I admire your restraint.
4530038	eng	Everyone seems to agree.

4530067	eng	Is this really allowed?
4530068	eng	I've come to apologize.
4530072	eng	I don't enjoy swimming.
4530075	eng	I admire your optimism.
4530083	eng	Tom wants answers now.
4530090	eng	Tom accepted the gift.
4530093	eng	That's not the answer.
4530094	eng	Not all experts agree.
4530096	eng	It was amazingly easy.
4530097	eng	I'll see Tom tomorrow.
4530099	eng	I wanted to apologize.
4530109	eng	Get your act together.
4530112	eng	Your plan won't work.

4530155	eng	That girl is Mary.
4530157	eng	I agreed with Tom.
4530158	eng	I agree with that.
4530164	eng	Tom is OK now.

4980814	eng	I see the sky.
4981127	eng	Duty calls to me.
4981513	eng	Better less than nothing.
4982433	eng	That's the right attitude.
4983062	eng	I identified him immediately.
4983577	eng	I've never regretted it.
4983580	eng	I'm really not sure.
4983586	eng	I'm a responsible person.
4983595	eng	I was certainly lucky.
4983606	eng	I think they're wrong.
4983610	eng	I still make mistakes.
4983618	eng	I know it's illegal.
4984205	eng	What a nice house!
4984297	eng	Tom is turning thirteen.
4984309	eng	I've been wrong before.
4984647	eng	This pen doesn't work.
4984714	eng	I'm taking my time.
4984720	eng	I'm siding with Tom.
4984727	eng	I'm only a freshman.
4985096	eng	My name sounds bizarre.
4985097	eng	My name sounds strange.
4985131	eng	Don't enter that room.
4985275	eng	I'm not upset anymore.
4985279	eng	I'm not sure actually.
4985280	eng	I'm glad Tom left.
4985282	eng	I wasn't too surprised.
4985885	eng	You are very intelligent.
4985999	eng	You have no scruples.
4986005	eng	The war goes on.
4986101	eng	I seldom see her.
4986230	eng	I'm a cocaine exporter.
4986298	eng	She likes books too.
4986300	eng	He is speaking loudly.
4986301	eng	She likes books also.
4986304	eng	She also likes books.
4986308	eng	They don't speak English.
4986309	eng	They don't know English.
4986452	eng	It refuses to die.
4986475	eng	We just ate dinner.
4986487	eng	They all went in.
4986505	eng	Clearly, it's a fraud.
4986553	eng	He showed us photos.
4986571	eng	He ruined his clothes.
4987168	eng	Tom stopped using Facebook.
4987173	eng	Tom arrived this morning.
4987200	eng	What's that restaurant's name?
4987281	eng	I think it's doable.
4987741	eng	He is an idiot.
4988135	eng	I'm tired of him!
4988136	eng	I'm sick of him!
4988379	eng	This is Tom's chair.
4988407	eng	Our relationship is stable.
4988421	eng	I'm only a newbie.
4989153	eng	Come eat with us.
4989176	eng	The voters have spoken.
4989191	eng	It's not a bug.
4989355	eng	He is a numpty.
4989724	eng	Quit while you're ahead.
4991245	eng	Will anybody else come?
4991261	eng	Tony jogs every day.
4991895	eng	I'm not ignoring them.
4993052	eng	The egg is hard.
4994795	eng	Everything is in flux.
4995394	eng	You should introduce yourself.
4996360	eng	This experiment was unsuccessful.
4997164	eng	Did Thomas get sick?
4998374	eng	Tom will be shocked.
4998384	eng	These aren't my ideas.
4998388	eng	That's what worrying me.
4998510	eng	I must buy shoes.
4999057	eng	Somebody might stop me.
4999058	eng	Perhaps I've been wrong.
4999143	eng	What's your marital status?
4999740	eng	I think everyone's overreacting.
4999831	eng	I've always loved Christmas.
4999862	eng	I'm sure it's inconvenient.
4999863	eng	I'm sorry, I misunderstood.
4999876	eng	I understand you're scared.
4999891	eng	I'm taking classes online.
4999892	eng	I'm pretty normal, really.
4999904	eng	I've rented an apartment.
4999905	eng	I've always been healthy.
4999906	eng	I'm really, really sorry.
4999908	eng	I'll definitely miss you.
4999909	eng	I think it's appropriate.
4999912	eng	I've never noticed that.
4999913	eng	I've already had dinner.
4999914	eng	I'm not very interested.
4999915	eng	I'm not being sarcastic.
4999916	eng	I like those sunglasses.
4999917	eng	It's almost my bedtime.
4999918	eng	I've been fairly lucky.
4999921	eng	I'm a little squeamish.
4999923	eng	I trust Tom's judgment.
4999925	eng	I love roller coasters.
4999926	eng	I love my independence.
4999927	eng	I ignored their advice.
4999931	eng	I'm just being myself.
4999934	eng	I was being facetious.
4999935	eng	I think it's horrible.
4999937	eng	I'm still not scared.
4999940	eng	I'm not an alcoholic.
4999943	eng	I'll pass that along.
4999944	eng	I think it's perfect.
4999945	eng	I just started today.
4999946	eng	I have work tomorrow.
4999947	eng	I actually like that.
4999955	eng	I wasn't having fun.
4999956	eng	How shall I proceed?
4999957	eng	Why's Tom so angry?
4999987	eng	I have a complaint.
5000001	eng	I'm tired of that.
5000005	eng	Why's it our job?
5000016	eng	Tom woke us up.
5000356	eng	Mornings are never good.
5000680	eng	Good, enough poetic images.
5000859	eng	Who can be sure?
5000860	eng	This was all free.
5000861	eng	This is our job.
5000863	eng	No one knew why.
5000870	eng	It's a bad omen.
5000878	eng	It was good fun.
5000893	eng	Here's a new one.
5001039	eng	We like your car.
5001380	eng	Why are we poor?
5001381	eng	Tom says he's OK.
5001383	eng	Tom says he's fine.
5001791	eng	I think they're happy.
5001810	eng	That's complicating the matter.
5003740	eng	Tell everyone you're drunk.
5004359	eng	Now, we exact justice.
5004806	eng	This will take time.
5004827	eng	It was fiendishly cold.
5004843	eng	I'm not denouncing you.
5004863	eng	Our team could win.
5004886	eng	How heavy are you?
5004889	eng	Here's a short list.
5006233	eng	Is it really fair?
5006428	eng	It's been great fun.
5006692	eng	I got soaking wet.
5006698	eng	He's a general practitioner.
5006699	eng	He's an amateur actor.
5006700	eng	What a useful gadget!
5006705	eng	Long live the king!
5006709	eng	Do girls also masturbate?
5006721	eng	The book sells well.
5006727	eng	We're relatives by marriage.
5006728	eng	He's spreading false rumors.
5006729	eng	She's spreading false rumors.
5006732	eng	Someone rang the doorbell.
5006735	eng	This expression is archaic.
5006736	eng	This is an archaism.
5006737	eng	His words hurt Meg.
5006741	eng	It speaks for itself.
5006742	eng	Art has no borders.
5006743	eng	Art has no limits.
5006744	eng	We're related by marriage.
5006746	eng	Don't forget your passports.
5006751	eng	I have Russian friends.
5006752	eng	Tom doesn't understand Sanskrit.
5006755	eng	Robin is Batman's friend.
5006842	eng	What is your philosophy?
5007273	eng	He smells the soup.
5007287	eng	Have you lived here?
5007460	eng	Tom is home again.
5007747	eng	We'll visit you sometime.
5007848	eng	She is Alan's wife.
5007911	eng	Are you drinking wine?
5007930	eng	It's the last train.
5007937	eng	That is my brother.
5007958	eng	You do not wash.
5007960	eng	The book was new.
5007990	eng	Did you drink wine?
5007999	eng	It was warm yesterday.
5008014	eng	Was Tom very busy?
5008393	eng	Tom is a papyrologist.
5008423	eng	Don't be a baby!
5008424	eng	She is quite impartial.
5008539	eng	She winked at Tom.
5008540	eng	Mary winked at Tom.
5008627	eng	Wow, that was close.
5008757	eng	It was pure luck.
5008834	eng	It may take time.
5008835	eng	It may not matter.
5008842	eng	No one wanted it.
5008890	eng	They may be wrong.
5008902	eng	That's likely not true.
5008903	eng	That's a good song.
5008938	eng	Your idea is good.
5008941	eng	You may be wrong.
5008951	eng	We're good at it.
5008960	eng	We practice a lot.
5008976	eng	We just met today.
5009423	eng	The bees are disappearing.
5009567	eng	Is this drinking water?
5009605	eng	We've lost too much.
5009704	eng	Was it of help?
5010235	eng	How can we refuse?
5010236	eng	It isn't that easy.
5010237	eng	It rained that day.
5010238	eng	It really was hard.
5010239	eng	It sure looks cool.
5010240	eng	It turned out fine.
5010241	eng	It's a lovely idea.
5010242	eng	It's kind of scary.
5010243	eng	It's not so simple.
5010244	eng	Let's not be naive.
5010245	eng	Tom knows the area.
5010246	eng	Who exactly is Tom?
5010248	eng	Tom may never leave.
5010250	eng	It's Tom's own fault.
5010251	eng	It's been very quiet.
5010252	eng	Tom manages a hotel.
5010256	eng	It was no coincidence.
5011021	eng	This is good stuff!
5011204	eng	Oh, a chocolate bunny!
5011325	eng	Bunnies are very cute.
5011335	eng	Bunnies are social animals.
5011384	eng	Why can't you stay?
5011385	eng	We were quite happy.
5011389	eng	We're in trouble now.
5011390	eng	You've made us proud.
5011392	eng	There's no set policy.
5011393	eng	Tom said he's healthy.
5011412	eng	When is your bedtime?
5011459	eng	Play it again, Sam.
5011477	eng	Hindsight is always 20/20.
5011486	eng	Beam me up, Scotty.
5011515	eng	The chicken was dry.
5011526	eng	It's an indecent proposition.
5011630	eng	No, I don't sing.
5011670	eng	How is your grandmother?
5011976	eng	I hate to travel.
5012582	eng	You can contact me.
5012583	eng	Can you contact me?
5012586	eng	Did he ever study?
5012789	eng	Dreams tell the truth.
5016371	eng	She is my heart.
5017673	eng	He led the meeting.
5018145	eng	Is Tom really busy?
5018146	eng	Is Tom really sick?
5018147	eng	Is Tom really happy?
5018148	eng	It still isn't over.
5018149	eng	It sure wasn't easy.
5018150	eng	It was pretty funny.
5018151	eng	It's still not easy.
5018152	eng	That may not matter.
5018153	eng	Tom has another job.
5018154	eng	Tom has been better.
5018156	eng	Tom has other ideas.
5018157	eng	Tom is still unsure.
5018158	eng	Tom just won't stop.
5018159	eng	Tom wants much more.
5018160	eng	We're not like that.
5018161	eng	How are you managing?
5018162	eng	Is Tom really guilty?
5018163	eng	Is that possible now?
5018427	eng	I sharpen the knife.
5018474	eng	I have dry hands.
5018800	eng	That boy is skinny.
5018939	eng	They closed the shop.
5018944	eng	Thomas closed the shop.
5018946	eng	The shop sells vegetables.

5020099	eng	Is Tom really Canadian?
5020470	eng	Tom likes the idea.
5020471	eng	What are the facts?
5020472	eng	Whose land is this?
5020473	eng	This is your chance.
5020474	eng	It's worth the money.
5020475	eng	Let's keep it simple.
5020476	eng	Tom still needs work.
5020477	eng	Tom worked with Mary.
5020478	eng	There's a pattern here.
5020479	eng	There's a waiting list.
5020480	eng	There's no one missing.
5020851	eng	What's Tom doing today?
5022315	eng	People aren't always rational.
5022640	eng	Tom makes great burgers.
5022696	eng	The store is jam-packed.
5022972	eng	It isn't always easy.
5023003	eng	It's beautiful weather today.

5031059	eng	Tom's the real expert.
5031066	eng	She's the real expert.
5031122	eng	Someone help me, please.
5033161	eng	That is very detailed.
5033191	eng	The results were amazing.
5033197	eng	Everyone talks about her.
5033890	eng	Horses don't like trailers.
5033999	eng	This is patently unfair.
5034000	eng	Do you like spinach?
5034030	eng	What's not to love?
5034343	eng	That planet has imploded.
5034345	eng	This maneuver was improvised.

5371440	eng	Tom is an introvert.
5371441	eng	Tom is an extrovert.
5371444	eng	Languages change over time.
5371593	eng	Is that your idea?
5371597	eng	Is that your role?
5371601	eng	It isn't worth it.
5371602	eng	Tom was wrongfully convicted.
5371605	eng	It's a great deal.
5371609	eng	It's all gone now.
5371610	eng	Tom wasn't seriously wounded.
5371787	eng	Talk to the hand.
5371877	eng	I brushed my teeth.
5371919	eng	Tom likes the exercise.

5373210	eng	No, it can't be!
5373239	eng	Someone's gotta do it.

5374219	eng	Tom, you're being rude.
5374401	eng	It's kind of cool.
5374405	eng	It's not a luxury.
5374413	eng	It's not an error.
5374417	eng	It's not bad here.
5374437	eng	It's not this one.
5374441	eng	It's not too hard.
5374445	eng	It's not yet over.
5374474	eng	I must be gone.
5374482	eng	It's not your job.
5374494	eng	It's only a guess.
5374819	eng	Tom probably needs help.
5374824	eng	It's sort of cool.
5374854	eng	Tom began talking immediately.
5374857	eng	Life can be rough.
5374860	eng	Tom does everything well.
5374861	eng	Life is good here.

5374942	eng	Tom does everything perfectly.
5374948	eng	Tom looks really worried.
5374949	eng	See you next year.
5374953	eng	That was our goal.
5374960	eng	That was our home.
5374961	eng	Tom overstepped his authority.
5374964	eng	That would be sad.
5374968	eng	That's a bad loss.
5374972	eng	That's a bad spot.
5374976	eng	That's a big blow.
5375010	eng	That's a big deal.
5375014	eng	That's a big fish.
5375018	eng	That's a big loss.
5375022	eng	That's a big step.
5375026	eng	That's a hard one.
5375895	eng	He came by train.
5376358	eng	I've been pretty distracted.
5377036	eng	That's all it was.
5377040	eng	That's all we did.
5377043	eng	Tom must've been tortured.
5377066	eng	This is deeply unfair.
5377078	eng	I'm going to Russia.
5377082	eng	We didn't believe him.
5377219	eng	I'm observing wild birds.
5377243	eng	Stupidity knows no bounds.
5377302	eng	That's hard to do.
5377309	eng	Tom was essentially right.
5377310	eng	That's just a lie.
5377847	eng	She's a little political.
5378111	eng	Watch out for pickpockets.
5378214	eng	Good morning my sunshine.
5378769	eng	Admit it, we're lost.
5378957	eng	He's just being macho.
5378996	eng	Stop being so immature.
5379001	eng	Stop being so emotional.
5379072	eng	What is it, darling?
5379073	eng	What is it, honey?
5379151	eng	You're just being nice.
5379358	eng	This is rather frightening.
5379406	eng	He broke a window.
5379433	eng	Lightning is nearly instantaneous.
5379449	eng	Cellphones are now ubiquitous.
5379812	eng	Tom was initially unsuccessful.
5379826	eng	Here are today's ledgers.
5380157	eng	He served me coffee.
5380213	eng	That's what I got.
5380217	eng	That's what I say.
5380427	eng	That's what we do.
5380435	eng	That's why I care.
5380438	eng	Tom is very self-confident.
5380439	eng	That's why I quit.
5380442	eng	Tom treated Mary differently.
5380443	eng	They all did well.
5381544	eng	Mike, how's it going?
5383122	eng	They all loved it.
5383126	eng	They did it again.
5383130	eng	They got it wrong.
5383134	eng	They have no jobs.
5383138	eng	They just beat us.
5383193	eng	They seem to care.
5383196	eng	Tom seemed genuinely upset.
5383197	eng	They should do it.
5383966	eng	We are different people.
5383970	eng	Don't feed the dog!
5384271	eng	We talked about music.
5384365	eng	The pizza tasted good.
5384751	eng	I wasn't expecting anyone.
5385161	eng	But it's not fair!
5385277	eng	Please don't hurt him.
5385409	eng	Only God is infallible.
5385935	eng	Paupers have no relatives.
5385956	eng	Don't interrupt the elderly.
5385978	eng	Dragons are imaginary creatures.
5386106	eng	The show was fun.
5386160	eng	We did well today.
5386164	eng	We know the risks.
5386172	eng	It made me chuckle.
5386407	eng	It made me nervous.
5386411	eng	It was pretty huge.
5386415	eng	It was really cool.
5386424	eng	It's a bad problem.
5386490	eng	It's a big concern.
5386494	eng	It's a big country.
5386498	eng	It's a great story.
5386502	eng	It's easy for them.
5386505	eng	Tom could've done something.
5386506	eng	It's good to dream.
5386629	eng	It's just a rabbit.
5386633	eng	It's not a gimmick.
5386649	eng	This is a mosque.
5386959	eng	It's taken a while.
5386971	eng	It's way too early.
5388138	eng	Tom likes Greek yogurt.
5388256	eng	Tapas are Spanish appetizers.
5388388	eng	Don't spoil the mood.
5388608	eng	Mary called me names.
5388728	eng	Do you work alone?
5388852	eng	Tom did a handstand.
5388854	eng	Mary did a cartwheel.
5388868	eng	Mary did a somersault.
5388892	eng	Backflips can be dangerous.
5388946	eng	Don't listen to rumors.
5388962	eng	He always does this.
5388963	eng	She always does this.
5389132	eng	I don't like science.
5389198	eng	There's no silver bullet.
5389357	eng	Did you kiss her?
5389368	eng	He reeked of liquor.
5389377	eng	Let's go eat together.
5389443	eng	It's way too small.
5389447	eng	It's what I wanted.
5389451	eng	The bus was packed.
5389646	eng	You guys messed up.
5389650	eng	Your kids are cute.
5389715	eng	That looks so boring.
5389735	eng	These are our children.
5389762	eng	Is this a puzzle?
5390328	eng	We haven't found him.
5390329	eng	We haven't found it.
5390445	eng	I see a stone.
5391198	eng	Tom's car was repossessed.
5391495	eng	Tom likes to argue.
5391498	eng	Tom dropped a bombshell.
5391567	eng	Mary brushed Kate's hair.
5391568	eng	Mary stroked Kate's hair.
5392415	eng	He's a well-known impresario.
5392529	eng	I'm kind of stunned.
5392530	eng	Tom's injuries aren't life-threatening.
5392537	eng	It's hard to choose.
5392541	eng	That's not a museum.
5392545	eng	That's not the goal.
5392583	eng	This isn't my money.
5392586	eng	Tom suddenly looked worried.
5392587	eng	We didn't play well.
5392591	eng	Are you leaving, too?
5392602	eng	I missed my mother.
5392636	eng	Mary is a nonvoter.
5393740	eng	Is distilled water drinkable?
5393880	eng	They don't eat anything.

5394617	eng	Let's pick up Tom.
5395101	eng	The water is beautiful.
5395126	eng	Here are the choices.
5395246	eng	Mary brushed her horse.
5395253	eng	I can't control that.
5395265	eng	I'll show you around.
5395299	eng	Could it be love?
5395405	eng	Tom's plan worked perfectly.
5395406	eng	It doesn't feel good.
5395410	eng	It wasn't a burglary.
5395473	eng	Let's go skating now.
5395477	eng	Let's make a snowman.
5395481	eng	Let's try that again.

5397486	eng	He bought new gloves.
5397860	eng	She bought new gloves.
5397922	eng	You're a peculiar girl.
5398357	eng	Prices keep going up.
5398365	eng	That sounds real bad.
5398368	eng	The footprints weren't Tom's.
5398373	eng	The truck drove away.
5398450	eng	This was no accident.
5398603	eng	Tom stole Mary's car.
5398604	eng	Today's my lucky day.

5404504	eng	Do you blame yourself?
5404508	eng	Don't even mention it.
5405070	eng	In fact, she lied.
5405076	eng	I always say that.

5409518	eng	Only one man survived.
5409845	eng	I don't like journalists!
5409863	eng	That's generous of you.
5410383	eng	Our system is corrupt.
5410389	eng	That's just absolutely ridiculous.
5410398	eng	Tom was there, too.
5411382	eng	That wasn't very good.
5411386	eng	That's not big enough.
5411914	eng	We're not officially dating.
5411978	eng	We have the equipment.
5411990	eng	What a fantastic idea!

5418186	eng	I rarely eat out.
5418188	eng	Who should I ask?
5418189	eng	You all need Tom.
5418224	eng	Simplicity is a virtue.
5418378	eng	You can't buy this.
5418383	eng	I hope Tom comes.
5418384	eng	My dog has fleas.
5418386	eng	We aren't always right.
5418390	eng	I want an answer.

5418435	eng	What a crazy day!
5418436	eng	Tom hoped to succeed.
5418590	eng	Tom's dog is well-trained.
5420068	eng	Is reality really real?

5420272	eng	I'm the boss now.

5422649	eng	We won't use that.
5422653	eng	I won't back down.
5422655	eng	Should I help them?

5422767	eng	Tom isn't doing well.
5422769	eng	Mary lost her handbag.
5422772	eng	What does that say?
5422773	eng	Tom jimmied the lock.
5422778	eng	It was very ugly.
5422779	eng	Tom joined our group.
5422780	eng	What a total idiot!
5422781	eng	What'll I tell Tom?

5423333	eng	Tom licked the spoon.

5424330	eng	What'll we call it?
5424708	eng	Don't go over there.
5424710	eng	It was still warm.
5424711	eng	Tom loved the change.
5424712	eng	Maybe it's bad luck.
5424714	eng	We argue every day.

5425611	eng	It's a nice break.
5425613	eng	Maybe it's not fair.
5425615	eng	We didn't run away.
5425617	eng	That ought to help.
5425620	eng	Tom must be innocent.
5425621	eng	What's next for us?
5425622	eng	Happy New Year, Tom.
5425628	eng	This is Tom's bag.
5425629	eng	Maybe it's worth it.

5428858	eng	Do you want massage?
5428862	eng	Leave the lights on.
5428864	eng	It didn't feel bad.
5428866	eng	People can be cruel.
5429430	eng	We waited too long.
5429432	eng	That's not too bad.
5429435	eng	Tom vacuumed his car.

5731926	eng	This makes things interesting.
5731928	eng	This is something interesting.
5731931	eng	This is entirely unproductive.
5731932	eng	This is absolutely disgusting.
5731937	eng	Things were getting desperate.
5731942	eng	Tom must've been unavailable.
5731965	eng	There were other contributors.
5731967	eng	There was occasional laughter.
5731974	eng	There are still possibilities.
5731982	eng	Their situation is precarious.
5731988	eng	The symptoms haven't returned.
5731991	eng	The strategy worked perfectly.
5732001	eng	The possibilities are immense.
5732003	eng	The police never investigated.
5732010	eng	The opportunities are endless.
5732016	eng	The implications are chilling.
5732019	eng	The economy steadily worsened.
5732021	eng	The donor requested anonymity.
5732022	eng	The difference is interesting.
5732024	eng	The difference is appreciated.
5732027	eng	The conversation got personal.
5732028	eng	The consequences are profound.
5732472	eng	He flexed his muscles.
5732577	eng	The cavalry arrived yesterday.
5732580	eng	The Jacksons just disappeared.
5732582	eng	That's what's being discussed.
5732592	eng	That's not very compassionate.
5732600	eng	That's a dangerous assumption.
5732619	eng	Sparks were flying everywhere.
5732622	eng	Something happened that night.
5732680	eng	The girl said nothing.
5732785	eng	Several problems still remain.
5732788	eng	Recruitment starts this month.
5732789	eng	Recruitment starts in October.
5732791	eng	Purchase advance tickets here.
5732797	eng	People voted for independence.
5732800	eng	People are really interesting.
5732804	eng	Pensions should be eliminated.
5732805	eng	Tom formerly played percussion.
5732806	eng	Paychecks continued to shrink.
5732807	eng	Pay attention to coincidences.
5732809	eng	Only thirteen people complied.
5732812	eng	Officials declined to comment.
5732816	eng	Nothing transpired between us.
5732820	eng	Tom enjoys manipulating people.
5732831	eng	Let's keep building airplanes.
5732843	eng	Kids wouldn't understand that.
5732852	eng	It's beyond all comprehension.
5732866	eng	It was absolutely devastating.
5732874	eng	Tom criticized Mary's approach.
5732896	eng	Is surgery always recommended?
5732897	eng	Informed consent is essential.
5733049	eng	Everything revolves around Tom.
5733092	eng	I felt incredibly comfortable.
5733109	eng	Tom's suicide changes nothing.
5733115	eng	Tom's personality has changed.
5733118	eng	Tom's parents weren't pleased.
5733127	eng	Tom's family was conservative.
5733162	eng	I appreciate your sensitivity.
5733171	eng	Families should live together.
5733173	eng	Families have been devastated.
5733174	eng	Expectations aren't being met.
5733177	eng	Everything is coming together.
5733179	eng	Everyone likes milk chocolate.
5733183	eng	Everyone has medical coverage.
5733196	eng	Tom went completely ballistic.
5733203	eng	Desperate measures were taken.
5733204	eng	Contraband may be confiscated.
5733205	eng	Tom wasn't expecting miracles.
5733222	eng	Anything less is unacceptable.
5733224	eng	Tom was subsequently arrested.
5733226	eng	All requests are confidential.
5733232	eng	Your comments are disgusting.
5733261	eng	You shouldn't have favorites.
5733267	eng	You handled that beautifully.
5733287	eng	We start tomorrow morning.
5733309	eng	Who's applying this pressure?
5733394	eng	What's your precise location.
5733438	eng	What regulations would apply?
5733440	eng	Tom was horribly disappointed.
5733658	eng	Do not eat hastily.
5733711	eng	I think you're crazy.
5733727	eng	What an insidious assumption!
5733728	eng	Weigh your choices carefully.
5733733	eng	We've increased our manpower.
5733754	eng	We've consulted with experts.
5733791	eng	Mary was absolutely right.
5733793	eng	We've been very conservative.
5733796	eng	We've been struggling lately.
5733797	eng	We've been kidding ourselves.
5733930	eng	We're still paying attention.
5733935	eng	We're redoubling our efforts.
5734010	eng	We're looking for terrorists.
5734015	eng	We're in uncharted territory.
5734247	eng	Tom was absolutely devastated.
5734282	eng	We're expecting some hiccups.
5734288	eng	We're checking for hepatitis.
5734289	eng	We're certainly not affluent.
5734291	eng	We're becoming too conceited.
5734295	eng	We're an advertising company.
5734305	eng	Tom understood that perfectly.
5734464	eng	Tom understands the criticism.
5734465	eng	We weren't always optimistic.
5734481	eng	We played exceptionally well.
5734487	eng	We maintain our independence.
5734491	eng	Tom supported Mary's children.
5734608	eng	Tom suddenly stopped fighting.
5734617	eng	Tom stood there flabbergasted.
5734629	eng	Tom started cursing everybody.
5734642	eng	Tom speaks relatively quickly.
5734653	eng	Volunteers will be uniformed.
5734655	eng	Various methods are possible.
5734656	eng	Vacations are being canceled.
5734658	eng	Unfortunately, the baby died.
5734662	eng	Those numbers are staggering.
5734667	eng	This was something different.
5734670	eng	This seems entirely accurate.
5734673	eng	This obviously isn't working.
5734679	eng	This is really unprecedented.
5734680	eng	This is really irresponsible.
5734682	eng	This is really heartbreaking.
5734686	eng	This is entirely inexcusable.
5734689	eng	This is clearly unacceptable.
5734697	eng	This hardly seems newsworthy.
5734700	eng	This country deserves better.
5734717	eng	Tom refuted these allegations.
5734718	eng	They appreciated our efforts.
5734725	eng	There's no disagreement here.
5734726	eng	Tom recognized Mary's glasses.
5734767	eng	There was intense opposition.
5734782	eng	The transformation had begun.
5734785	eng	The surgery went wonderfully.
5734789	eng	The situation is intolerable.
5734792	eng	The selection process worked.
5734952	eng	The response was predictable.
5734965	eng	Tom never questioned anything.
5734969	eng	The numbers are overwhelming.
5734970	eng	The noise continued unabated.
5734992	eng	The judgement was impeccable.
5734998	eng	The installation is complete.
5735015	eng	The destruction was horrific.
5735022	eng	Tom looks desperately worried.
5735023	eng	The conspiracy will continue.
5735026	eng	The comparison is legitimate.
5735027	eng	The children were mesmerized.
5735548	eng	These eggs are fresh.
5735579	eng	That raises another question.
5735583	eng	Tom isn't totally pessimistic.
5735584	eng	That explains the complaints.
5735588	eng	Some major challenges remain.
5735593	eng	Setting limits is imperative.
5735594	eng	Sales were apparently dismal.
5735596	eng	Please prepare for departure.
5735597	eng	Please be more understanding.
5735600	eng	People were sleeping outside.
5735605	eng	People are hugging strangers.
5735611	eng	Our business is confidential.
5735619	eng	Tom is naturally disappointed.
5735624	eng	Nothing makes any difference.
5735626	eng	Nothing is really guaranteed.
5735634	eng	Tom is extremely manipulative.
5735645	eng	My neighborhood is wonderful.
5735651	eng	Monkey bars are disappearing.
5735654	eng	Many meetings were conducted.
5735659	eng	Life became very restrictive.
5735666	eng	Let the investigations begin.
5735669	eng	Jury selection begins Monday.
5735678	eng	It's not entirely unpleasant.
5735686	eng	It's an awesome organization.
5735694	eng	Tom immediately sensed danger.
5735698	eng	It was absolutely incredible.
5735699	eng	It was absolutely horrendous.
5735701	eng	It stimulated my imagination.
5735704	eng	It sounds deceptively simple.
5735728	eng	Invitations have been mailed.
5735729	eng	Injuries are another problem.
5735732	eng	I've never lacked confidence.
5735734	eng	I've never demanded anything.
5735768	eng	I'm getting real comfortable.
5735771	eng	I'm excited about everything.
5735819	eng	I understand the frustration.
5735844	eng	Tom got increasingly agitated.
5735889	eng	Tom felt completely powerless.
5735916	eng	Tom doesn't particularly mind.
5735931	eng	Tom dismissed this allegation.
5735962	eng	I can't accommodate everyone.
5735990	eng	Grownups are funny sometimes.
5735992	eng	Good luck getting permission.
5735996	eng	Families have been destroyed.
5735998	eng	Everything was kept separate.
5736000	eng	Tom confirmed his resignation.
5736002	eng	Everyone loves those stories.
5736004	eng	Everyone is really dedicated.
5736007	eng	Everyone is expecting action.
5736010	eng	Everybody feels the pressure.
5736013	eng	Educate yourself about money.
5736018	eng	Tom brought everyone together.
5736023	eng	Current data is inconclusive.
5736026	eng	Cool slightly before serving.
5736028	eng	Competition makes you better.
5736031	eng	Commodity prices are falling.
5736034	eng	Coal is especially important.
5736037	eng	Cleaning will continue today.
5736038	eng	Children are always learning.
5736052	eng	Building permits got delayed.
5736055	eng	Beer makes everything better.
5736071	eng	All results are confidential.
5736074	eng	All investments involve risk.
5736076	eng	Your prejudices are showing.
5736077	eng	Your initiation is complete.
5736112	eng	Who would've predicted this?
5736118	eng	Who researched this article?
5736131	eng	What specifically looks bad?
5736143	eng	What an extraordinary woman.
5736152	eng	Welcome to our neighborhood.
5736158	eng	We've had challenges before.
5736167	eng	We've been too inconsistent.
5736175	eng	We're surrounded by zombies.
5736178	eng	We're still in negotiations.
5736185	eng	We're not excluding anybody.
5736188	eng	We're not being represented.
5736194	eng	We're making great progress.
5736196	eng	We're looking for stability.
5736197	eng	We're looking for engineers.
5736200	eng	We're looking at everything.
5736201	eng	We're just being consistent.
5736205	eng	Confidence changed Tom's life.
5736207	eng	We're getting more tourists.
5736210	eng	We're desperate for weapons.
5736212	eng	We're completely against it.
5736216	eng	We're always getting better.
5736219	eng	We'll have real competition.
5736227	eng	We were quickly overwhelmed.
5736245	eng	We regret the inconvenience.
5736247	eng	Tom's story sounded credible.
5736250	eng	Tom's story is mind-boggling.
5736254	eng	We need long-term solutions.
5736256	eng	Tom's situation isn't unique.
5736258	eng	We must have accountability.
5736259	eng	Tom's situation is desperate.
5736277	eng	Tom's heart started pounding.
5736292	eng	Tom's expectations are clear.
5736303	eng	We had terrible experiences.
5736304	eng	Tom would've gone regardless.
5736320	eng	We aren't entirely helpless.
5736330	eng	Various sizes are available.
5736335	eng	Those were tough conditions.
5736336	eng	Those are encouraging signs.
5736339	eng	This statement is ludicrous.
5736347	eng	This is truly inspirational.
5736357	eng	This family is unbelievable.
5736358	eng	Tom wasn't terribly coherent.
5736359	eng	This expense is unavoidable.
5736365	eng	Things are looking brighter.
5736381	eng	They were great adversaries.
5736384	eng	They should have intervened.
5736386	eng	They see things differently.
5736387	eng	They promised me everything.
5736392	eng	They have monetary problems.
5736393	eng	They have legitimate gripes.
5736403	eng	Tom was obviously devastated.
5736405	eng	There's nobody building now.
5736407	eng	There's no such distinction.
5736408	eng	There's no more electricity.
5736410	eng	There's no documented proof.
5736416	eng	There was no accountability.
5736423	eng	There have been allegations.
5736426	eng	There are always challenges.
5736437	eng	The streets become deserted.
5736441	eng	The response was phenomenal.
5736443	eng	The relief is instantaneous.
5736447	eng	The possibility is exciting.
5736450	eng	The phone continued ringing.
5736453	eng	The pattern is unmistakable.
5736459	eng	The moment was electrifying.
5736462	eng	The group continued walking.
5736466	eng	Tom was approved unanimously.
5736467	eng	The experience was draining.
5736470	eng	The distinction is critical.
5736471	eng	The detectives were baffled.
5736478	eng	Tom was always nonjudgmental.
5736479	eng	The country's falling apart.
5736480	eng	The conditions were perfect.
5736482	eng	The conditions are terrible.
5736483	eng	The competition is terrific.
5736486	eng	The challenges are numerous.
5736488	eng	The challenges are mounting.
5736495	eng	The black market flourished.
5736497	eng	The attacker escaped easily.
5736510	eng	That's not common knowledge.
5736523	eng	Tom thinks it's embarrassing.
5736530	eng	That was really encouraging.
5736539	eng	That was absolutely amazing.
5736548	eng	That can complicate matters.
5736560	eng	Stop asking these questions.
5736563	eng	Sometimes things just click.
5736572	eng	Schemes have been discussed.
5736573	eng	Safety remains our priority.
5736576	eng	Prepare to launch torpedoes.
5736577	eng	Tom returned the compliment.
5736578	eng	Potatoes are very versatile.
5736587	eng	People should be encouraged.
5736588	eng	People have lost everything.
5736590	eng	People hate feeling trapped.
5736591	eng	People get pretty emotional.
5736596	eng	People are still recovering.
5736600	eng	Our weaknesses were exposed.
5736606	eng	Obviously emotions are high.
5736613	eng	Tom never stopped performing.
5736617	eng	Nobody left me instructions.
5736620	eng	My secretary is incompetent.
5736624	eng	Most people were unaffected.
5736635	eng	Many muggings go unreported.
5736648	eng	Let's assume that'll happen.
5736653	eng	Large areas were deforested.
5736654	eng	Keep your environment clean.
5736682	eng	Tom looked somewhat familiar.
5736708	eng	It was absolutely fantastic.
5736710	eng	It was absolutely brilliant.
5736711	eng	It was absolutely beautiful.
5736717	eng	It shocked me significantly.
5736723	eng	It certainly looks terrific.
5736732	eng	Individual results may vary.
5736734	eng	I've stopped going downtown.
5736741	eng	I've found some inspiration.
5736747	eng	I've always remembered that.
5736939	eng	We sleep lying down.
5737188	eng	I support religious freedom.
5737191	eng	I still remain disappointed.
5737211	eng	I personally prefer Twitter.
5737215	eng	I never celebrate successes.
5737374	eng	I couldn't concentrate long.
5737378	eng	Tom had conflicting feelings.
5737391	eng	I bought something recently.
5737403	eng	I appreciate your integrity.
5737404	eng	I appreciate the confidence.
5737405	eng	Tom gave Mary mouth-to-mouth.
5737407	eng	I admire his forthrightness.
5737414	eng	Tom felt utterly overwhelmed.
5737431	eng	Frustration levels are high.
5737437	eng	Evidence has been recovered.
5737439	eng	Evidence has been destroyed.
5737446	eng	Everybody should get tested.
5737449	eng	Elections are quite complex.
5737450	eng	Tom disclosed his intentions.
5737461	eng	Do they have transportation?
5737463	eng	Discipline leads to success.
5737467	eng	Destiny brought us together.
5737470	eng	Consumer confidence is down.
5737472	eng	Consider yourself on notice.
5737491	eng	Both charges were withdrawn.
5737493	eng	Autopsies will be performed.
5737495	eng	Tom didn't attract attention.
5737499	eng	Are they hurting themselves?
5737500	eng	Are these guards infallible?
5737503	eng	Analysts see it differently.
5737505	eng	All volunteers are welcomed.
5737506	eng	All numbers are approximate.
5737508	eng	Advance payment is required.
5737515	eng	You're not too bad-looking.
5737519	eng	Tom deserves special mention.
5737529	eng	You make learning exciting.
5737531	eng	Tom definitely was available.
5737532	eng	You know you're interested.
5737538	eng	You can overcome obstacles.
5737542	eng	Women deserve equal rights.
5737543	eng	Tom declined further comment.
5737552	eng	Tom couldn't understand that.
5737556	eng	Who's feeding these people?
5737561	eng	Tom converted to Catholicism.
5737564	eng	Tom confronted Mary directly.
5737580	eng	What inspired your project?
5737586	eng	What causes teeth grinding?
5737598	eng	We've had some discussions.
5737604	eng	We've been very consistent.
5737607	eng	We're trying to understand.
5737611	eng	We're struggling right now.
5737613	eng	We're struggling every day.
5737616	eng	We're solving our problems.
5737617	eng	We're prepared and focused.
5737619	eng	We're not that influential.
5737620	eng	We're not questioning that.
5737627	eng	Tom avoided military service.
5737630	eng	Tom attended Catholic school.
5737634	eng	We're devastated over this.
5737635	eng	We're dealing with thieves.
5737637	eng	We're changing the process.
5737638	eng	We're brothers and sisters.
5737639	eng	Tom appreciates strong women.
5737640	eng	We're being very proactive.
5737641	eng	We're all like-minded here.
5737647	eng	We'll hold you accountable.
5737649	eng	We'll have some exceptions.
5737650	eng	We'll assess the situation.
5737656	eng	We were very opportunistic.
5737659	eng	We were both shell-shocked.
5737661	eng	We watched movies together.
5737662	eng	We wanted more interaction.
5737672	eng	Tom aggravated the situation.
5737673	eng	We really felt comfortable.
5737674	eng	We put everything together.
5737675	eng	Tom addressed their concerns.
5737685	eng	We need government control.
5737692	eng	We know they're formidable.
5737715	eng	We have lofty expectations.
5737722	eng	We did everything manually.
5737727	eng	We believe in transparency.
5737728	eng	Water clarity is excellent.
5737733	eng	Tragedy can happen quickly.
5737737	eng	This will solve everything.
5737742	eng	This was totally voluntary.
5737745	eng	This proved very difficult.
5737752	eng	This is pretty spectacular.
5737754	eng	This is pretty meaningless.
5737755	eng	This is outrageous conduct.
5737772	eng	This choice is interesting.
5737775	eng	Things will come naturally.
5737784	eng	They've washed their hands.
5737796	eng	They were really concerned.
5737799	eng	They were incredibly close.
5737802	eng	They were being aggressive.
5737817	eng	They clearly suffered here.
5737818	eng	They certainly got noticed.
5737820	eng	They believe in themselves.
5737823	eng	These are fully functional.
5737836	eng	There were several reasons.
5737839	eng	There were no fingerprints.
5737850	eng	There are some limitations.
5737851	eng	There are challenges ahead.
5737853	eng	Their styles are different.
5737856	eng	Their attitude makes sense.
5737862	eng	The train suddenly lurched.
5737863	eng	The town continued growing.
5737869	eng	The story sounded familiar.
5737872	eng	The stench is overpowering.
5737875	eng	The sidewalks are deserted.
5737882	eng	You're responsible, not Tom.
5737890	eng	The partners are concerned.
5737892	eng	The outlook remains bright.
5737895	eng	The numbers are staggering.
5737899	eng	The letters were delivered.
5737904	eng	The key is experimentation.
5737908	eng	The infection is spreading.
5737913	eng	The gangsters started firing.
5737914	eng	The future looks fantastic.
5737916	eng	The fighting was ferocious.
5737922	eng	The doorknob slowly turned.
5737923	eng	The doctor misdiagnosed it.
5737925	eng	The difference is dramatic.
5737926	eng	The demand is breathtaking.
5737928	eng	The decline was inevitable.
5737930	eng	Tom's support is unwavering.
5737931	eng	The data suggest otherwise.
5737932	eng	The damage is irreversible.
5737936	eng	Tom's story is preposterous.
5737937	eng	The conspiracy was massive.
5737945	eng	Tom's parents never married.
5737947	eng	That's what happened today.
5737948	eng	Tom's numbers are incorrect.
5737951	eng	Tom's life ended tragically.
5737954	eng	Tom's ideas weren't popular.
5737957	eng	Tom's ideas were thoughtful.
5737959	eng	That was very enlightening.
5737960	eng	Tom's ideas were futuristic.
5737962	eng	That was our understanding.
5737963	eng	Tom's house was burglarized.
5737965	eng	That trend should continue.
5737966	eng	Tom's grades soon plummeted.
5737970	eng	That should mean something.
5737971	eng	That money would've helped.
5737972	eng	Tom's death was devastating.
5737974	eng	That is gradually changing.
5737975	eng	Tom's competitors know that.
5737977	eng	That doesn't apply anymore.
5737978	eng	Tom's column appears weekly.
5737980	eng	That could get interesting.
5737985	eng	Stop coddling these people.
5737986	eng	Stop being so inflammatory.
5737987	eng	Tom's allegations are false.
5737992	eng	Stability has been elusive.
5737996	eng	Some retailers charge less.
5738002	eng	Small banks are struggling.
5738004	eng	Rooms are single occupancy.
5738005	eng	Remember to enjoy yourself.
5738010	eng	Please share your solution.
5738011	eng	Please read our disclaimer.
5738014	eng	Plan your life accordingly.
5738019	eng	People really want answers.
5738022	eng	People are still suffering.
5738025	eng	People are already talking.
5738026	eng	Pensions can be terminated.
5738028	eng	Our people are disciplined.
5738031	eng	Our data suggest otherwise.
5738032	eng	Others are less optimistic.
5738034	eng	Obviously you love cooking.
5738037	eng	Not everyone belongs there.
5738048	eng	Tom will arrange everything.
5738050	eng	Monday will be interesting.
5738053	eng	Loud music started playing.
5738055	eng	Long lines are unnecessary.
5738056	eng	Life has improved markedly.
5738057	eng	Tom wasn't following anyone.
5738058	eng	Let's start with leftovers.
5738061	eng	Let's look at alternatives.
5738063	eng	Tom wasn't being complacent.
5738072	eng	Tom was watching everything.
5738083	eng	It was pretty heartwarming.
5738086	eng	It was absolutely gorgeous.
5738088	eng	It was absolutely fabulous.
5738089	eng	It makes everything harder.
5738094	eng	It happened at Harvard.
5738095	eng	It didn't happen overnight.
5738098	eng	Is three years unrealistic?
5738105	eng	Tom was sincerely impressed.
5738110	eng	I've been given assurances.
5738112	eng	I've always understood you.
5738113	eng	I've already prepared that.
5738120	eng	Tom was outstanding tonight.
5738127	eng	I'm still getting stronger.
5738154	eng	I'm getting another lawyer.
5738155	eng	I'm feeling great actually.
5738158	eng	I'm definitely going along.
5738161	eng	I'm considering the change.
5738167	eng	I'm a medical technologist.
5738174	eng	Tom was elected chairperson.
5738191	eng	I was somewhat dumbfounded.
5738195	eng	Tom was absolutely terrific.
5738208	eng	I was basically ostracized.
5738213	eng	Tom wants immediate results.
5738224	eng	I think it's inappropriate.
5738291	eng	Tom started making mistakes.
5738294	eng	Tom started investing early.
5738309	eng	Tom saw something different.
5738319	eng	I experienced it firsthand.
5738327	eng	Tom reiterated that concern.
5738330	eng	Tom regretted it afterwards.
5738336	eng	Tom received minor injuries.
5738350	eng	I did basically everything.
5738360	eng	Tom often paints landscapes.
5738368	eng	Tom never looks comfortable.
5738370	eng	I appreciate your thoughts.
5738396	eng	Folks are pulling together.
5738397	eng	Fighting back is difficult.
5738400	eng	Everything's fresh and new.
5738402	eng	Everything has been smooth.
5738403	eng	Everything else was normal.
5738406	eng	Emotions were running high.
5738416	eng	Tom made several recordings.
5738420	eng	Democrats oppose that idea.
5738423	eng	Companies are cutting jobs.
5738424	eng	Charges were later dropped.
5738426	eng	Change is very challenging.
5738438	eng	Both offenses are felonies.
5738439	eng	Both are equally plausible.
5738441	eng	Be careful while traveling.
5738447	eng	An appointment is required.
5738450	eng	All charges were dismissed.
5738454	eng	Your chances are terrible.
5738457	eng	You're quite welcome here.
5738459	eng	You're always on vacation.
5738460	eng	You'd better double check.
5738462	eng	You'd best look elsewhere.
5738467	eng	Tom kept things interesting.
5738473	eng	Tom just stopped everything.
5738475	eng	Working together pays off.
5738498	eng	What was your inspiration?
5738502	eng	What motivated these kids?
5738504	eng	What makes them different?
5738505	eng	What happened last season?
5738516	eng	Wearing green is optional.
5738517	eng	We've really been bonding.
5738520	eng	We've had our differences.
5738526	eng	We're very much impressed.
5738529	eng	We're very fortunate here.
5738531	eng	We're taking it seriously.
5738535	eng	We're still pushing ahead.
5738540	eng	We're ready for adventure.
5738543	eng	We're not telling anybody.
5738545	eng	Tom is living hand-to-mouth.
5738546	eng	We're not above criticism.
5738556	eng	We're fighting to survive.
5738558	eng	We're almost dead already.
5738561	eng	We're all still confident.
5738565	eng	We'll serve fried chicken.
5738567	eng	We'll probably never know.
5738568	eng	We'll never be complacent.
5738574	eng	We would've done anything.
5738578	eng	Tom is considered dangerous.
5738594	eng	Show them the door.
5738595	eng	Hats off to him!
5738599	eng	Let's make another toast.
5738693	eng	We understand the impulse.
5738699	eng	We think that's realistic.
5738700	eng	We surrounded the village.
5738705	eng	We should be millionaires.
5738709	eng	We played reasonably well.
5738715	eng	We need more productivity.
5738735	eng	We have high expectations.
5738742	eng	We eventually got married.
5738748	eng	We demand better planning.
5739198	eng	Tom hasn't forgiven anybody.
5739207	eng	Tom hasn't been campaigning.
5739211	eng	We always worked together.
5739214	eng	Travel broadens your mind.
5739215	eng	Tractors should be banned.
5739217	eng	Times were different then.
5739218	eng	Times have surely changed.
5739226	eng	This raises many concerns.
5739227	eng	This night was inevitable.
5739233	eng	This is strictly business.
5739236	eng	This is pretty remarkable.
5739238	eng	This is hardly surprising.
5739241	eng	This is absolutely insane.
5739253	eng	They were washing clothes.
5739254	eng	They were always together.
5739257	eng	They understood my plight.
5739328	eng	They tease me mercilessly.
5739331	eng	They outplayed us tonight.
5739332	eng	They need some counseling.
5739334	eng	They have stayed friendly.
5739346	eng	They deserve to celebrate.
5739347	eng	They deserve an education.
5739349	eng	They botched that autopsy.
5739352	eng	There's so much diversity.
5739358	eng	There will be controversy.
5739359	eng	There was widespread fear.
5739362	eng	There have been successes.
5739371	eng	Their news was horrifying.
5739373	eng	Their hopes have vanished.
5739376	eng	The wind blows constantly.
5739380	eng	The view was breathtaking.
5739383	eng	The two clicked instantly.
5739386	eng	The truth hurts sometimes.
5739519	eng	The training is paramount.
5739520	eng	Tom greeted Mary cheerfully.
5739521	eng	The timing is unfortunate.
5739522	eng	The television is blaring.
5739524	eng	The team understands that.
5739530	eng	The silence was deafening.
5739531	eng	The silence is oppressive.
5739536	eng	The results were stunning.
5739541	eng	Tom expresses himself badly.
5739542	eng	The proposal was rejected.
5739543	eng	The prophecy is fulfilled.
5739545	eng	The prognosis is alarming.
5739546	eng	The process isn't perfect.
5739548	eng	The procedure is painless.
5739551	eng	The people were screaming.
5739552	eng	The people deserve better.
5739556	eng	The number was staggering.
5739557	eng	Tom directed the production.
5739559	eng	The mission is terminated.
5739565	eng	The guilt is overwhelming.
5739567	eng	The goal is accessibility.
5739568	eng	The function was canceled.
5739570	eng	The flavor is sensational.
5739577	eng	The documentation is fine.
5739653	eng	The crowd was electrified.
5739655	eng	The crowd is appreciative.
5739656	eng	The cows graze peacefully.
5739660	eng	Tom didn't escape unscathed.
5739661	eng	The children went berserk.
5739662	eng	The cheers were deafening.
5739664	eng	The challenge is accepted.
5739667	eng	The borders remain closed.
5739671	eng	The blankets were helpful.
5739672	eng	Tom developed tongue cancer.
5739673	eng	The backsliding has begun.
5739674	eng	The adjustment is painful.
5739675	eng	Tom denied molesting anyone.
5739682	eng	That's the real challenge.
5739688	eng	That's no laughing matter.
5739689	eng	That's my life's ambition.
5739693	eng	Tom constantly felt anxious.
5739695	eng	That's certainly a factor.
5739696	eng	Tom certainly seems content.
5739699	eng	Tom certainly isn't pleased.
5739703	eng	That would be unthinkable.
5739704	eng	That would be outstanding.
5739706	eng	That was really beautiful.
5739707	eng	That was pretty effective.
5740532	eng	That was an embarrassment.
5740539	eng	That opportunity was lost.
5740540	eng	Tom calculated the expenses.
5740541	eng	That must be investigated.
5740542	eng	That looks really painful.
5740545	eng	That counts for something.
5740550	eng	Take your trash elsewhere.
5740554	eng	Sure, we've made mistakes.
5740556	eng	Support is very important.
5740559	eng	Sometimes it really hurts.
5740560	eng	Something needs to change.
5740562	eng	Something more was needed.
5740563	eng	Somebody dropped the ball.
5740568	eng	Some people adjust easily.
5740572	eng	Silence isn't always good.
5740577	eng	Rain is needed everywhere.
5740584	eng	People would be horrified.
5740586	eng	People should eat healthy.
5740589	eng	People love sports heroes.
5740590	eng	People are expecting more.
5740595	eng	Our expectations are high.
5740598	eng	Our culture is threatened.
5740599	eng	Our children deserve that.
5740604	eng	Oil prices rose yesterday.
5740607	eng	Nothing was very specific.
5740617	eng	Neighbors are still upset.
5740619	eng	Nearly three hours passed.
5740623	eng	My mistake was responding.
5740625	eng	My husband is hardworking.
5740628	eng	My friends were disgusted.
5740629	eng	My father passed recently.
5740634	eng	Most people would survive.
5740635	eng	More regulation is needed.
5740637	eng	More charges are expected.
5740640	eng	Monday wasn't much better.
5740641	eng	Men will believe anything.
5740643	eng	Memories fade too quickly.
5740647	eng	Many residents were angry.
5740662	eng	Let the discussions begin.
5740664	eng	Let the controversy begin.
5740725	eng	It was really unfortunate.
5740727	eng	It was really informative.
5740730	eng	It was pretty unfortunate.
5740731	eng	It was pretty devastating.
5740733	eng	It was incredibly surreal.
5740734	eng	It was extremely grueling.
5740760	eng	It really was spectacular.
5740761	eng	It really feels demeaning.
5740766	eng	It makes life interesting.
5740767	eng	It made little difference.
5740768	eng	Tom's smile was contagious.
5740777	eng	Tom's injuries were severe.
5740779	eng	It could get embarrassing.
5740780	eng	Tom's ideas were ridiculed.
5740783	eng	Tom's heart began pounding.
5740788	eng	Is the staff professional?
5740789	eng	Tom's death was mysterious.
5740795	eng	Tom wouldn't discuss money.
5740798	eng	Tom worries about security.
5740799	eng	I've given you everything.
5740800	eng	I've enjoyed it immensely.
5740802	eng	I've enjoyed every minute.
5740804	eng	Tom witnessed the ceremony.
5740805	eng	I've been waiting forever.
5740806	eng	I've been very privileged.
5740809	eng	I've become more tolerant.
5741152	eng	I'm making no predictions.
5741153	eng	Tom went missing yesterday.
5741163	eng	I'm happy with everything.
5741164	eng	I'm happy that's resolved.
5741178	eng	I'm done being irrational.
5741184	eng	I'm addicted to lollipops.
5741185	eng	I'll take almost anything.
5741187	eng	I'll sleep better tonight.
5741204	eng	Tom was subsequently fired.
5741205	eng	I wasn't effective enough.
5741223	eng	I was having palpitations.
5741225	eng	Tom was quickly recaptured.
5741227	eng	I was completely clueless.
5741234	eng	Tom was mumbling something.
5741254	eng	I still have reservations.
5741260	eng	I saw something different.
5741261	eng	Tom was hooked immediately.
5741273	eng	Tom was deeply embarrassed.
5741276	eng	Tom was completely sloshed.
5741284	eng	I like the responsibility.
5741297	eng	Tom was always encouraging.
5741303	eng	Tom was absolutely certain.
5741304	eng	I hold myself accountable.
5741328	eng	I feel really downtrodden.
5741333	eng	Tom vehemently denied this.
5741339	eng	Tom turned around suddenly.
5741356	eng	I consider that extortion.
5741372	eng	Tom thinks it's hysterical.
5741559	eng	Do you speak Talysh?
5741672	eng	I always welcome comments.
5741674	eng	I almost became nauseated.
5741679	eng	Tom suddenly became famous.
5741698	eng	History is simply history.
5742045	eng	Have you experienced this?
5742046	eng	Tom speaks from experience.
5742047	eng	Good luck finding tickets.
5742048	eng	Getting the truth matters.
5742056	eng	Everything's clear as day.
5742062	eng	Everyone has their rights.
5742066	eng	Everybody breaks this law.
5742068	eng	Every season is different.
5742069	eng	Every movement is painful.
5742492	eng	Aren't you working today?
5742502	eng	Why don't you stop?
5742512	eng	Don't be too arrogant!
5742525	eng	Does this surprise anyone?
5742526	eng	Does that description fit?
5742527	eng	Tom screamed bloody murder.
5742528	eng	Does it ultimately matter?
5742537	eng	Democrats should be upset.
5742544	eng	Continue living your life.
5742624	eng	He has woken Tom.
5742704	eng	Tom is a chauvinist.
5742766	eng	Consumer confidence is up.
5742768	eng	Tom really likes chocolate.
5742769	eng	Clean up after yourselves.
5742770	eng	Chill well before serving.
5742772	eng	Charges are still pending.
5742773	eng	Change is never immediate.
5742781	eng	Call for more information.
5742785	eng	Both ventures ended badly.
5742786	eng	Tom proved himself tonight.
5742787	eng	Both have been criticized.
5742793	eng	Athletes are no different.
5742797	eng	Are you comfortable there?
5742798	eng	Are we honestly surprised?
5742801	eng	Are there dangerous areas?
5742802	eng	Tom never stopped shooting.
5742806	eng	Anybody can become famous.
5742807	eng	Any suggestion would help.
5742810	eng	And then what'll happen?
5742813	eng	All tips are confidential.
5742815	eng	All residents are invited.
5742818	eng	All are equally important.
5742819	eng	Accessibility is an issue.
5742821	eng	A replacement is required.
5742824	eng	Your plans won't succeed.
5742825	eng	Your life is meaningless.
5743501	eng	You helped me incredibly.
5743503	eng	You gotta love Australia.
5743509	eng	Will there be resistance?
5743510	eng	Will their marriage work?
5743517	eng	Tom looked around uneasily.
5743873	eng	He hurt me deliberately.
5743875	eng	She hurt me deliberately.
5743901	eng	I've eaten my sandwich.
5744121	eng	Why are there exemptions?
5744124	eng	Who's buying these bonds?
5744129	eng	Who cares about calories?
5744133	eng	Where is your patriotism?
5744139	eng	Where are our priorities?
5744143	eng	Tom isn't so understanding.
5744157	eng	Tom isn't innocent anymore.
5744158	eng	What makes you different?
5744169	eng	Tom is welcomed everywhere.
5744172	eng	Tom is unbelievably naïve.
5744179	eng	What are your principles?
5744187	eng	Tom is something different.
5744188	eng	Were there any customers?
5744194	eng	Weeks turned into months.
5744196	eng	Tom is obviously disturbed.
5744198	eng	We've lost some momentum.
5744203	eng	We're stronger than that.
5744206	eng	We're pretty scared here.
5744207	eng	We're pleased about that.
5744215	eng	We're managing just fine.
5744216	eng	We're looking for trends.
5744218	eng	We're just average folks.
5744220	eng	We're changing the rules.
5744221	eng	We're all very outspoken.
5744232	eng	We were talking theology.
5744237	eng	Tom is approaching manhood.
5744244	eng	We use shared facilities.
5744245	eng	We use proven strategies.
5744247	eng	We understand the issues.
5744256	eng	We shouldn't forget that.
5744257	eng	We should love everybody.
5744271	eng	We need additional staff.
5744275	eng	We love playing football.
5744287	eng	We just talked yesterday.
5744290	eng	We help resolve disputes.
5744296	eng	We have different values.
5744312	eng	Tom has multiple sclerosis.
5744316	eng	We challenged each other.
5744319	eng	We can support ourselves.
5744320	eng	We can manage everything.
5744324	eng	Tom has denied involvement.
5744325	eng	We weren't born yesterday.
5744326	eng	Was your office involved?
5744327	eng	Tom has cardiac arrhythmia.
5744329	eng	Uncertainty is very high.
5744331	eng	Traffic will be rerouted.
5744332	eng	Today it's freezing cold.
5744337	eng	Those are fair questions.
5744350	eng	This is very unfortunate.
5744353	eng	This is very commendable.
5744359	eng	This is simply appalling.
5744361	eng	This is serious business.
5744365	eng	This is more interactive.
5744367	eng	This is just inexcusable.
5744373	eng	This change was critical.
5744374	eng	This cancer could return.
5744377	eng	This bill is unnecessary.
5744380	eng	This article is nonsense.
5744381	eng	Things went very quickly.
5744383	eng	Things are getting tight.
5744387	eng	They're still chasing me.
5744389	eng	They're running in place.
5744393	eng	They're not made anymore.
5744396	eng	They're moving toward us.
5744409	eng	Tom found something better.
5744410	eng	They're fixing the latch.
5744411	eng	They're fighting over me.
5744415	eng	Tom felt perfectly content.
5744416	eng	They're coming right now.
5744417	eng	They're all pretty tired.
5744422	eng	They wish to investigate.
5744423	eng	They were very welcoming.
5744424	eng	Tom faces criminal charges.
5744425	eng	They were found unharmed.
5744426	eng	They were expecting more.
5744428	eng	They were being tortured.
5744430	eng	Tom exploded with laughter.
5744431	eng	They suffered from burns.
5744435	eng	They sold off everything.
5744436	eng	Tom ended the relationship.
5744437	eng	They should be disbanded.
5744438	eng	They seemed like friends.
5744440	eng	They kept hanging around.
5744441	eng	They just look different.
5744443	eng	They held us accountable.
5744445	eng	Tom drafted the resolution.
5744450	eng	They all look ridiculous.
5744452	eng	They all did brilliantly.
5744453	eng	These are fair questions.
5744455	eng	There's no middle ground.
5744465	eng	There will be challenges.
5744473	eng	There has been vandalism.
5744474	eng	There are three problems.
5744477	eng	There are many believers.
5744479	eng	There are always debates.
5744480	eng	Their approach is unique.
5744485	eng	The transfer is complete.
5744486	eng	The students also helped.
5744487	eng	Tom described the intruder.
5744488	eng	The staff were fantastic.
5744489	eng	The silence is deafening.
5744490	eng	Tom denied himself nothing.
5744493	eng	Tom denied any involvement.
5744494	eng	The results surprised me.
5744495	eng	The reality is different.
5744496	eng	Tom definitely didn't mind.
5744498	eng	The process was repeated.
5744499	eng	Tom defended that decision.
5744501	eng	The party's winding down.
5744504	eng	The outcome is uncertain.
5744506	eng	The occasion was special.
5744510	eng	The incentives are clear.
5744512	eng	The engine never stopped.
5744516	eng	The course was difficult.
5744518	eng	The conversation is over.
5744519	eng	The conclusion is biased.
5744521	eng	The computer was damaged.
5744524	eng	The child died instantly.
5744525	eng	The charges were dropped.
5744527	eng	The charge was dismissed.
5744528	eng	The change came suddenly.
5744530	eng	The butler serves dinner.
5744533	eng	The artists were shocked.
5744537	eng	The airport remains open.
5744539	eng	The 1930s were different.
5744540	eng	That's your top priority.
5744544	eng	Tom began threatening Mary.
5744545	eng	That's not strictly true.
5744551	eng	That's missing the point.
5744556	eng	Tom asked for verification.
5744578	eng	That trend is continuing.
5744581	eng	That never helped anyone.
5744585	eng	That could be convenient.
5744587	eng	That all changed tonight.
5744588	eng	Terrorism will never end.
5744590	eng	Take me off speakerphone.
5744591	eng	Surely we deserve better.
5744593	eng	Start saving money today.
5744594	eng	Sorry about this morning.
5744596	eng	Sometimes you can't tell.
5744601	eng	Tom absolutely deserves it.
5744609	eng	So many people responded.
5744648	eng	Tom receives unemployment benefit.
5744684	eng	Should we be intimidated?
5744690	eng	Several days have passed.
5744691	eng	Security is minimal here.
5744694	eng	Resources may be limited.
5744699	eng	Programs like these help.
5744700	eng	Prices have been slashed.
5744702	eng	Power has its privileges.
5744703	eng	Please stop spewing lies.
5744712	eng	People are very friendly.
5744714	eng	People are so judgmental.
5744715	eng	Parking will be enforced.
5744717	eng	Our menu changes monthly.
5744718	eng	Our kids were devastated.
5744733	eng	Nothing can surpass this.
5744734	eng	I've watched Tom carefully.
5744735	eng	Not everyone is thrilled.
5744739	eng	Nobody ever knows anyone.
5744741	eng	No replacement was named.
5744744	eng	No election is necessary.
5744745	eng	My question still stands.
5744748	eng	My motives were personal.
5744750	eng	My mother was devastated.
5744751	eng	My mind's barely working.
5744753	eng	My father is intelligent.
5744756	eng	My doctor is unconcerned.
5744757	eng	My comment was sarcastic.
5744759	eng	My cholesterol went down.
5744760	eng	My approach is different.
5744763	eng	Medicine was running low.
5744766	eng	Maybe we'll recognize it.
5744772	eng	Many terms are ambiguous.
5744783	eng	Let's not confuse things.
5744786	eng	Let's find common ground.
5744814	eng	It's something like that.
5744821	eng	We're paying Tom's salary.
5744825	eng	It's not always possible.
5744830	eng	We appointed Tom chairman.
5744831	eng	It's making me nostalgic.
5744841	eng	It's been very rewarding.
5744842	eng	Tom's speed is incredible.
5744843	eng	It's been very difficult.
5744844	eng	It's been truly horrible.
5744848	eng	Tom's hair was disheveled.
5744857	eng	Tom's got school tomorrow.
5744858	eng	It's a strange situation.
5744859	eng	It's a relevant question.
5744861	eng	It's a little surprising.
5744865	eng	It was very enlightening.
5744867	eng	It was tough financially.
5744868	eng	It was total devastation.
5744872	eng	Tom witnessed the assault.
5744873	eng	It was simply terrifying.
5744874	eng	It was simply incredible.
5744876	eng	It was really meaningful.
5744877	eng	It was pretty disruptive.
5744886	eng	It should mean something.
5744888	eng	It should be informative.
5744891	eng	It really was impressive.
5744892	eng	It needn't have happened.
5744899	eng	Tom wasn't really shocked.
5744901	eng	It gets real interesting.
5744902	eng	Tom wasn't gaining weight.
5744905	eng	Tom was very conservative.
5744906	eng	It completely floored me.
5744908	eng	Tom was surprisingly nice.
5744913	eng	Is the response positive?
5744921	eng	Is it purely coincidence?
5744923	eng	Tom was simply devastated.
5744924	eng	Illness is another issue.
5744925	eng	I've really been blessed.
5744927	eng	I've never understood it.
5744934	eng	I've been very impressed.
5744936	eng	I've been absurdly lucky.
5744937	eng	I've always cherished it.
5744942	eng	I'm speechless right now.
5744948	eng	I'm praying that happens.
5744950	eng	Tom was immensely popular.
5744952	eng	I'm not finding anything.
5744959	eng	Tom was extremely popular.
5744962	eng	Tom was equally impressed.
5744967	eng	I'm finally done working.
5744970	eng	I'm feeling very excited.
5744978	eng	I'll take whatever comes.
5745040	eng	I'll continue to improve.
5745042	eng	Tom was almost unbeatable.
5745045	eng	Tom was Mary's competitor.
5745046	eng	I would've played longer.
5745061	eng	I was moderately excited.
5745062	eng	I was missing everything.
5745067	eng	I was getting frustrated.
5745079	eng	I walked out immediately.
5745090	eng	Tom tested positive twice.
5745093	eng	Tom suffered leg injuries.
5745100	eng	I survived the shipwreck.
5745106	eng	I should break something.
5745107	eng	I see something terrible.
5745108	eng	Tom squeezed Mary tightly.
5745116	eng	I never recommended that.
5745118	eng	I never felt intimidated.
5745119	eng	I love this organization.
5745121	eng	I like helicopter pilots.
5745137	eng	I just think differently.
5745141	eng	Tom seems very interested.
5745162	eng	Tom regretted his actions.
5745163	eng	I got stronger overnight.
5745168	eng	Tom pushed Mary backwards.
5745177	eng	Tom politely corrected me.
5745182	eng	I don't control anything.
5745186	eng	Tom never understood that.
5745201	eng	Tom never asked questions.
5745206	eng	I can't acknowledge that.
5745210	eng	Tom needs no introduction.
5745211	eng	I believe that statement.
5745218	eng	How much change occurred?
5745223	eng	How do worms communicate?
5745231	eng	Tom lives for competition.
5745233	eng	History proved him right.
5745242	eng	Funding remains an issue.
5745243	eng	Tom likes to micro-manage.
5745245	eng	Exceptions will be noted.
5745247	eng	Everything worked out OK.
5745248	eng	Everything looks so calm.
5745250	eng	Everything is so serious.
5745251	eng	Everyone has their price.
5745254	eng	Everybody has off nights.
5745266	eng	Does anyone read anymore?
5745267	eng	Tom kept emphasizing that.
5745276	eng	Tom just barely succeeded.
5745318	eng	Tom is obviously troubled.
5745322	eng	Catfish are still biting.
5745326	eng	Bricks have been falling.
5745327	eng	Tom is more opportunistic.
5745329	eng	Birth records are public.
5745331	eng	Better things are coming.
5745332	eng	Be confident in yourself.
5745345	eng	Tom is equally optimistic.
5745350	eng	Are we that thin-skinned?
5745351	eng	Tom is completely useless.
5745361	eng	A heated argument ensued.
5745367	eng	Your sources were wrong.
5745368	eng	Your offer is offensive.
5745370	eng	Your life seems perfect.
5745373	eng	Your country thanks you.
5745374	eng	Your comment is foolish.
5745376	eng	Your cheeks are flushed.
5745377	eng	Your argument has holes.
5745380	eng	You're the ignorant one.
5745382	eng	You're making me hungry.
5745383	eng	You're an honorable man.
5745385	eng	You're a senior partner.
5745387	eng	Tom initiated the program.
5745393	eng	You should encourage it.
5745395	eng	Tom hasn't left Australia.
5745396	eng	You have thirty minutes.
5745398	eng	Tom has undeniable talent.
5745404	eng	Tom has special abilities.
5745416	eng	Tom has managerial talent.
5745562	eng	You have red wine.
5745590	eng	I hate that look!
5745658	eng	Return good for evil.
5745660	eng	Honor cannot be repaired.
5745706	eng	Son is like father.
5745712	eng	Revenge today, mourning tomorrow.
5745832	eng	It was quite interesting.
5745838	eng	I followed your suggestion.
5745859	eng	Tom has crucified himself.
5745861	eng	Who would've thought it?
5745863	eng	Who would notice anyway?
5745866	eng	Who needs that headache?
5745889	eng	Tom had hangnail problems.
5745890	eng	What does "stress" mean?
5745892	eng	Tom had aggression issues.
5745899	eng	What are their policies?
5745900	eng	What are their findings?
5745903	eng	Welcome back to reality.
5745905	eng	We've learned to adjust.
5745906	eng	We've got to prioritize.
5745907	eng	Tom gets everything wrong.
5745908	eng	We've done our research.
5745909	eng	We've been playing well.
5745914	eng	We're just staying home.
5745917	eng	We're doing fairly well.
5745918	eng	We're cutting you loose.
5745920	eng	We're cutting our costs.
5745921	eng	We're confident as well.
5745923	eng	We're committed to that.
5745925	eng	Tom examined the evidence.
5745926	eng	We're changing the rule.
5745929	eng	We're calling the shots.
5745938	eng	We would demand privacy.
5745939	eng	We were very aggressive.
5745940	eng	Tom didn't mention Boston.
5745941	eng	We were more aggressive.
5745947	eng	We started awfully slow.
5745951	eng	We needn't have worried.
5745957	eng	We need more crosswalks.
5745959	eng	We need everyone's vote.
5745960	eng	We need an intervention.
5745961	eng	Tom deserves our patience.
5745962	eng	We must have confidence.
5745964	eng	Tom defended his findings.
5745971	eng	We've lost our leader.
5745974	eng	We have ambitious plans.
5745976	eng	Tom can't afford anything.
5745980	eng	We don't want inflation.
5745986	eng	We definitely need them.
5745987	eng	We could look elsewhere.
5745989	eng	We clicked very quickly.
5746001	eng	Turn your head sideways.
5746008	eng	Training is going great.
5746010	eng	Tomorrow will be better.
5746012	eng	Tom asked great questions.
5746013	eng	This week was different.
5746014	eng	This week is ridiculous.
5746016	eng	This was really intense.
5746019	eng	This violates state law.
5746022	eng	This team is phenomenal.
5746024	eng	Tom already arranged that.
5746030	eng	Tom adjusted his schedule.
5746032	eng	This is surely sensible.
5746034	eng	This is really humbling.
5746040	eng	This is indeed shameful.
5746043	eng	This is entirely untrue.
5746044	eng	This is clearly illegal.
5746046	eng	This is absolutely nuts.
5746048	eng	Mary batted her eyelashes.
5746051	eng	Many people denounced Tom.
5746056	eng	This article was boring.
5746061	eng	Things started out fine.
5746062	eng	Things have changed now.
5746065	eng	They're taking too long.
5746067	eng	They're still out there.
5746068	eng	They're still good kids.
5746070	eng	They're right behind us.
5746071	eng	They're not saying that.
5746073	eng	They're not fairy tales.
5746074	eng	They're looking into it.
5746076	eng	They're filthy rich now.
5746077	eng	They were true patriots.
5746079	eng	They were just gambling.
5746080	eng	They were fully clothed.
5746085	eng	They mean business here.
5746086	eng	They love to intimidate.
5746089	eng	They got along famously.
5746098	eng	There were many victims.
5746100	eng	There was some shouting.
5746104	eng	There was no comparison.
5746106	eng	There was no aggression.
5746109	eng	There is no provocation.
5746110	eng	There is no controversy.
5746112	eng	There is no competition.
5746113	eng	There has been pressure.
5746115	eng	There are two solutions.
5746116	eng	There are no assurances.
5746118	eng	Their sources are wrong.
5746122	eng	The wheels were turning.
5746123	eng	I loved Tom's performance.
5746124	eng	The training was superb.
5746125	eng	The situation is stable.

5746133	eng	The raid was successful.
5746134	eng	The place was decimated.
5746136	eng	The people are confused.
5746137	eng	The nation is polarized.
5746140	eng	The idea seems dreadful.
5746142	eng	The format is different.
5746149	eng	The demand was enormous.
5746154	eng	The crowd was fantastic.
5746155	eng	The crew was supportive.
5746158	eng	The colors are gorgeous.
5746160	eng	The children come first.
5746161	eng	The check never cleared.
5746163	eng	The bus finally arrived.
5746168	eng	What makes Tom different?
5746170	eng	That's the problem here.
5746181	eng	That show is ridiculous.
5746182	eng	That seems unlikely now.
5746191	eng	That left an impression.
5746192	eng	Tom's teammates need him.
5746193	eng	That could change today.
5746195	eng	Tom's pleas were ignored.
5746196	eng	That changed after 2013.
5746197	eng	That article is rubbish.
5746198	eng	Tom's plan is incomplete.
5746199	eng	Thanks for your service.
5746200	eng	Thanks for including me.
5746201	eng	Tom's offer was declined.
5746205	eng	Spend within your means.
5746206	eng	Sometimes I hear voices.
5746207	eng	Tom's life was destroyed.
5746208	eng	Sometimes I hear things.
5746210	eng	Tom's leave was canceled.
5746212	eng	Should we disarm police?
5746213	eng	Tom's ideas were extreme.
5746215	eng	Ribbons will be awarded.
5746217	eng	Prayer can work wonders.
5746219	eng	Tom's hands were mangled.
5746220	eng	Please forgive my error.
5746223	eng	People said nice things.
5746224	eng	People must accept this.
5746227	eng	People call me paranoid.
5746229	eng	People are getting hurt.
5746230	eng	People are buying stuff.
5746232	eng	Our kids deserve better.
5746233	eng	Our confidence was high.
5746234	eng	Tom wrote the screenplay.
5746235	eng	One person was selected.
5746236	eng	Now it's more difficult.
5746237	eng	Tom wouldn't accept help.
5746241	eng	Nothing gets past you.
5746242	eng	Nobody twisted your arm.
5746245	eng	No purchase is required.
5746250	eng	No details were offered.
5746251	eng	Never approach a cougar.
5746253	eng	Neither bill became law.
5746254	eng	My world's fallen apart.

5746265	eng	My jet needed refueling.
5746271	eng	My feelings are genuine.
5746272	eng	My family is devastated.
5746277	eng	Much is still uncertain.

5746280	eng	Monday was no different.
5746283	eng	Many hearts were broken.
5746284	eng	Listen to your siblings.
5746285	eng	Tom wasn't even involved.
5746289	eng	Let's stay calm, people.
5746290	eng	Let me know immediately.
5746295	eng	Ketchup should be thick.

5746306	eng	Tom was slightly excited.
5746315	eng	Tom was really inspiring.
5746318	eng	Tom was really deserving.
5746321	eng	Tom was re-elected mayor.
5746326	eng	It's just mind boggling.
5746331	eng	It's everything we have.
5746332	eng	It's better than before.
5746336	eng	Tom was more spontaneous.
5746341	eng	It's a no-win situation.
5746342	eng	Tom was later reinstated.
5746343	eng	It's a challenging time.
5746348	eng	Tom was gone immediately.
5746353	eng	It wasn't an aberration.
5746358	eng	It was simply unhealthy.
5746359	eng	It was really emotional.
5746361	eng	It was really difficult.
5746362	eng	It was real frustrating.
5746364	eng	It was pretty hilarious.
5746365	eng	It was pretty extensive.
5746367	eng	It was pretty emotional.
5746368	eng	It was pretty elaborate.
5746371	eng	It was most appropriate.
5746558	eng	It was absolutely crazy.
5746560	eng	It was absolutely awful.
5746562	eng	Tom visited me regularly.
5746565	eng	Tom used some discretion.
5746568	eng	Tom used his imagination.
5746570	eng	It sounds really absurd.
5746571	eng	Tom twirled his mustache.
5746575	eng	It really looks amazing.
5746577	eng	Tom tried something else.
5746578	eng	It must've been destiny.
5746584	eng	It helped me incredibly.
5746588	eng	It changed very quickly.
5746591	eng	It bothers me immensely.
5746595	eng	Tom threw Mary overboard.
5746596	eng	Is there anything worse?
5746597	eng	Is there another remedy?
5746604	eng	Tom taught me gymnastics.
5746607	eng	Tom taught me everything.
5746609	eng	Is change always better?
5746610	eng	Tom suddenly fell silent.
5746611	eng	I've never been tempted.
5746615	eng	I've heard quite enough.
5746616	eng	Tom struggled to breathe.
5746623	eng	I'm still not panicking.
5746625	eng	Tom started flipping out.
5746631	eng	Tom sometimes watches TV.
5746632	eng	I'm not against anybody.
5746633	eng	I'm no longer listening.
5746643	eng	I'm capable of anything.
5746646	eng	I'm armed and dangerous.
5746649	eng	I'm actually quite calm.
5746655	eng	I'll prove you're wrong.
5746656	eng	Tom remains on probation.
5746658	eng	I'll be perfectly frank.
5746667	eng	I'd like to participate.
5746669	eng	I'd expect nothing less.
5746670	eng	I work tomorrow morning.
5746671	eng	Tom quietly stepped down.
5746674	eng	Tom quietly said goodbye.
5746675	eng	I welcome your thoughts.
5746685	eng	I was most disconcerted.
5746687	eng	I was having nightmares.
5746690	eng	I was already committed.
5746694	eng	I wanted radical change.
5746695	eng	Tom performed his duties.
5746703	eng	I value handmade things.
5746704	eng	Tom never was judgmental.
5746713	eng	Tom never discusses that.
5746716	eng	Tom neglects his studies.
5746718	eng	I taught until recently.
5746719	eng	Tom needn't have worried.
5746720	eng	I suck at relationships.
5746721	eng	I stayed really patient.
5746724	eng	I started asking around.
5746725	eng	Tom might recognize Mary.
5746727	eng	I should start drinking.
5746737	eng	Tom made steady progress.
5746738	eng	I remember every threat.
5746745	eng	I oppose property taxes.
5746746	eng	Tom left no instructions.
5746748	eng	I listened more closely.
5746751	eng	I liked the documentary.
5746758	eng	Tom later confirmed this.
5746762	eng	I kind of procrastinate.
5746775	eng	I just caution everyone.
5746777	eng	I just can't sympathize.
5746792	eng	I have great confidence.
5746795	eng	I hate doing interviews.
5746801	eng	I found it unfulfilling.
5746802	eng	I feel your frustration.
5746803	eng	Tom is running unopposed.
5746805	eng	I feel more independent.
5746813	eng	I don't support amnesty.
5746821	eng	Tom is attending college.
5746828	eng	I didn't train properly.
5746831	eng	I didn't attack anybody.
5746834	eng	I couldn't stop smiling.
5746837	eng	I couldn't control them.
5746843	eng	I congratulate you both.
5746844	eng	I completely screwed up.
5746859	eng	I bought it immediately.
5746861	eng	I believe I'm objective.
5746862	eng	I appreciate their work.
5746863	eng	Tom hasn't been indicted.
5746864	eng	I applaud this research.
5746865	eng	I applaud their efforts.
5746869	eng	Tom has several theories.
5746870	eng	I admire your fortitude.
5746871	eng	I absolutely believe it.
5746873	eng	Hungry people do better.
5746875	eng	Tom has remained neutral.
5746880	eng	How motivating was that?
5746893	eng	Tom has incredible speed.
5746900	eng	Here's the real problem.
5746901	eng	Growing up was exciting.
5746903	eng	God bless everyone here.
5746905	eng	Tom has been unstoppable.
5746906	eng	Get the courts involved.
5746910	eng	Forget we said anything.
5746912	eng	Food prices have surged.
5746916	eng	Everything else is gone.
5746917	eng	Tom hardly speaks French.
5746919	eng	Everyone could see that.
5746921	eng	Everyone but me laughed.
5746922	eng	Everybody needs a drink.
5746924	eng	Everybody has an agenda.
5746925	eng	Every loss is difficult.
5746928	eng	Every case is different.
5746930	eng	Even that wasn't enough.
5746932	eng	Tom had devastating news.
5746933	eng	Enrollment will be free.
5746934	eng	Eat a healthy breakfast.
5746935	eng	Tom had cosmetic surgery.
5746937	eng	Don't provoke the beast.
5746951	eng	Do little things matter?
5746965	eng	Tom expressed no remorse.
5746968	eng	Tom entered Mary's house.
5746971	eng	Tom enjoys fishing trips.
5746972	eng	Debris was cleared away.
5746973	eng	Criminals are so stupid.
5746978	eng	Compliments to the chef.
5746985	eng	Breathe from your belly.
5746988	eng	Both wore dark clothing.
5746991	eng	Birthrates are too high.
5746993	eng	Batten down the hatches.
5746994	eng	Baseball games are long.
5746996	eng	Australia is an example.
5746998	eng	Tom died very peacefully.
5747005	eng	Are they still sweating?
5747006	eng	Are these people insane?
5747014	eng	All dates are tentative.
5747015	eng	Alcoholism is not funny.
5747017	eng	Airlines are going bust.
5747019	eng	Tom deserves his freedom.
5747021	eng	You've lost me already.
5747022	eng	Tom departed last Monday.
5747025	eng	Tom definitely pushed me.
5747027	eng	You need a celebration.
5747030	eng	You keep bouncing back.
5747035	eng	You all deserve better.
5747040	eng	Tom contacted the police.
5747041	eng	Why are you encouraged?
5747043	eng	Tom confirmed the report.
5747046	eng	Tom concentrated on that.
5747050	eng	What's your login name?
5747053	eng	What's the main reason?
5747054	eng	What's the lesson here?
5747056	eng	What should they build?
5747059	eng	What might change that?
5747060	eng	What made it fantastic?
5747062	eng	What happens from here?
5747063	eng	What else is available?
5747065	eng	What do politicians do?
5747066	eng	What are their motives?
5747068	eng	What accounts for this?
5747069	eng	Weekends are very busy.
5747072	eng	We've had some success.
5747073	eng	Tom buzzed his secretary.
5747074	eng	We're psyched about it.
5747077	eng	We're not endorsing it.
5747078	eng	We're hanging in there.
5747079	eng	Tom betrayed his country.
5747081	eng	We'll never keep quiet.
5747085	eng	Tom began binge drinking.
5747093	eng	We were so intimidated.
5747094	eng	Tom became Mary's mentor.
5747095	eng	We were jumping around.
5747097	eng	Tom backed everything up.
5747100	eng	Tom asked to participate.
5747101	eng	We support free speech.
5747102	eng	We started really slow.
5747103	eng	Tom always remained poor.
5747104	eng	We should embrace that.
5747105	eng	We put things together.
5747106	eng	Tom always comes through.
5747107	eng	We never were physical.
5747109	eng	Tom absolutely nailed it.
5747111	eng	We need better support.
5747112	eng	Tom abandoned his search.
5747113	eng	We must look elsewhere.
5747114	eng	We must keep improving.
5747125	eng	We have stuck together.
5747129	eng	We got outplayed today.
5747130	eng	That's what Tom demanded.
5747135	eng	We do need electricity.
5747136	eng	That would've suited Tom.
5747141	eng	Was there a connection?
5747144	eng	War is very profitable.
5747147	eng	Training is going well.
5747149	eng	Traffic is slow moving.
5747150	eng	Tomorrow it's our turn.
5747154	eng	Today you have options.
5747159	eng	Money was corrupting Tom.
5747160	eng	This paper is pathetic.
5747161	eng	This news is thrilling.
5747163	eng	This makes us stronger.
5747167	eng	This is something else.
5747169	eng	This is so complicated.
5747170	eng	This is small potatoes.
5747180	eng	Imagine life without Tom.
5747182	eng	This is dangerous talk.
5747188	eng	This has been verified.
5747191	eng	This could get awkward.
5747193	eng	Things began to happen.
5747197	eng	They're kids, you know.
5747199	eng	They should be ashamed.
5747200	eng	They share the cooking.
5747202	eng	They lost every battle.
5747203	eng	They looked good today.
5747205	eng	They could do anything.
5747206	eng	They changed the photo.
5747208	eng	These rules are stupid.
5747209	eng	These people are crazy.
5747211	eng	These dogs are killers.
5747214	eng	There's only one catch.
5747218	eng	There is no substitute.
5747221	eng	There is no difference.
5747224	eng	The voters want change.
5747226	eng	The system is outdated.
5747227	eng	The solution is simple.
5747229	eng	The shock was terrible.
5747230	eng	The reviews were mixed.
5747232	eng	The refs were horrible.
5747233	eng	The process is ongoing.
5747235	eng	The place is beautiful.
5747236	eng	The panic has subsided.
5747237	eng	I applaud Tom's decision.
5747242	eng	The future looked good.
5747244	eng	The food is tremendous.
5747247	eng	The dogs were unharmed.
5747248	eng	The demand is enormous.
5747250	eng	The courts will decide.
5747251	eng	The context is crucial.
5747252	eng	Don't fool yourself, Tom.
5747253	eng	The case got dismissed.
5747257	eng	That's where I'm wrong.
5747271	eng	That raises the stakes.
5747280	eng	That looks good enough.
5747282	eng	We'll miss Tom terribly.
5747283	eng	That could soon change.
5747284	eng	That could change soon.
5747286	eng	That changed on Monday.
5747287	eng	That can probably wait.
5747289	eng	Thanks for the thought.
5747290	eng	Thank you for noticing.
5747294	eng	Tom's wife divorced him.
5747296	eng	Start living your life.
5747297	eng	Tom's response is wrong.
5747298	eng	Something was in there.
5747300	eng	Tom's offer was refused.
5747303	eng	Tom's message is simple.
5747305	eng	Simplicity is key here.
5747306	eng	Tom's heart stood still.
5747310	eng	Shop wherever you want.
5747311	eng	Secure the garage door.
5747314	eng	Respect goes both ways.
5747316	eng	Rent is getting higher.
5747319	eng	Proceeds go to charity.
5747322	eng	Please state your name.
5747325	eng	Please get home safely.
5747326	eng	Please don't back down.
5747328	eng	Please comment on this.
5747329	eng	Planes can be diverted.
5747332	eng	Personally I like both.
5747334	eng	People are coming back.
5747335	eng	People are catching on.
5747336	eng	Tom witnessed the crime.
5747337	eng	Our training went well.
5747338	eng	Our economy is booming.
5747341	eng	Nothing will come easy.
5747343	eng	Nothing is ever secure.
5747344	eng	Nothing is an accident.
5747345	eng	Tom will be officiating.
5747346	eng	Nothing came from that.
5747347	eng	No solution is perfect.
5747349	eng	No calls were returned.
5747352	eng	My husband is disabled.
5747355	eng	Make your summer count.
5747357	eng	Tom was too deferential.
5747359	eng	Let's talk about money.
5747362	eng	Let's see what unfolds.
5747364	eng	Let's define our terms.
5747365	eng	Last night was amazing.
5747367	eng	Just read the comments.
5747368	eng	Just make something up.
5747370	eng	Just look for yourself.
5747375	eng	Tom was notified Monday.
5747378	eng	Tom was later penalized.
5747385	eng	It's never good enough.
5747386	eng	It's my birthday today.
5747387	eng	Tom was happily married.
5747393	eng	Tom was extremely angry.
5747396	eng	Tom was equally pleased.
5747401	eng	It's been so difficult.
5747405	eng	Tom was deeply involved.
5747408	eng	Tom was class president.
5747411	eng	Tom was brutally honest.
5747414	eng	Tom was an overachiever.
5747418	eng	It'll all become clear.
5747421	eng	It was very misleading.
5747422	eng	It was so discouraging.
5747424	eng	It was reported stolen.
5747427	eng	It was most impressive.
5747429	eng	Tom wants to contribute.
5747430	eng	It was extremely noisy.
5747431	eng	It was complete mayhem.
5747433	eng	It was an overreaction.
5747444	eng	Tom values our opinions.
5747447	eng	Tom used the dictionary.
5747450	eng	Tom understands you now.
5747454	eng	It should've been mine.
5747455	eng	It really is sickening.
5747457	eng	It poses some problems.
5747464	eng	It makes them stronger.
5747467	eng	It makes it worthwhile.
5747472	eng	It does mean something.
5747473	eng	It does get nauseating.
5747474	eng	Tom survived the attack.
5747477	eng	Tom survived his injury.
5747478	eng	Is this fear justified?
5747480	eng	Tom surveyed the damage.
5747483	eng	Tom supports his family.
5747486	eng	Tom studied Mary's face.
5747488	eng	I've seen children die.
5747491	eng	I've done nothing else.
5747496	eng	I've asked for amnesty.
5747497	eng	I'm training every day.
5747498	eng	Tom squashed the banana.
5747502	eng	I'm thankful for today.
5747504	eng	Tom sounds totally cool.
5747511	eng	Tom should be president.
5747513	eng	I'm open to everything.
5747514	eng	Tom shares Mary's views.
5747515	eng	I'm not very reassured.
5747519	eng	I'm not defending that.
5747521	eng	I'm not being critical.
5747523	eng	Tom says he's undecided.
5747531	eng	I'm excited either way.
5747533	eng	I'm basically a nobody.
5747536	eng	I'm a personal manager.
5747537	eng	I'm a little different.
5747538	eng	Tom runs extremely well.
5747539	eng	I'm a financial expert.
5747541	eng	Tom rescinded his offer.
5747542	eng	I'll miss you terribly.
5747543	eng	I'll make one tomorrow.
5747544	eng	Tom remembers your name.
5747545	eng	I'll keep expenses low.
5747550	eng	Tom remains behind bars.
5747553	eng	Tom regrets his mistake.
5747554	eng	I'd sign that petition.
5747556	eng	Tom really irritates me.
5747560	eng	I'd make it worthwhile.
5747565	eng	Tom practiced very hard.
5747566	eng	I wouldn't change much.
5747568	eng	Tom overdosed on heroin.
5747570	eng	I wasn't being patient.
5747573	eng	I was really disturbed.
5747574	eng	Tom notified the police.
5747575	eng	I was really committed.
5747578	eng	I was physically ready.
5747582	eng	I was just overwhelmed.
5747584	eng	I was just dumbfounded.
5747589	eng	Tom must behave himself.
5747590	eng	I was extremely elated.
5747591	eng	I was doing everything.
5747593	eng	I was confident enough.

5747601	eng	Tom made the difference.
5747607	eng	Tom loves chicken wings.
5747609	eng	I understand very well.
5747610	eng	Tom lost the nomination.
5747615	eng	I think it's realistic.
5747617	eng	I think it's atrocious.
5747618	eng	I think it'll backfire.
5747626	eng	I sometimes think that.
5747627	eng	I smell something here.
5747636	eng	I respect my opponents.
5747638	eng	I remain very cautious.
5747642	eng	I needn't have worried.
5747651	eng	I love your generosity.
5747654	eng	I like your comparison.
5747657	eng	I know from experience.
5747658	eng	Tom isn't without blame.
5747667	eng	Tom isn't feeling great.
5747668	eng	I just adore mysteries.

5747708	eng	I could've sung better.
5747716	eng	I believe in education.
5747722	eng	How times have changed.
5747725	eng	How quickly time flies.
5747728	eng	How irrelevant is that?
5747729	eng	How important are they?
5747730	eng	Tom is high maintenance.
5747732	eng	How depressing is that?
5747738	eng	Hopefully they slip up.
5747740	eng	Hold your horses there.
5747744	eng	Have courage and fight.
5747746	eng	Good luck this weekend.
5747747	eng	God bless this country.
5747749	eng	Girls are really cruel.
5747750	eng	Get your hankies ready.
5747752	eng	Get the facts straight.
5747757	eng	Free speech is healthy.
5747759	eng	Tom is an oceanographer.
5747760	eng	Everything was held up.
5747766	eng	Everything is shut off.
5747769	eng	Everyone here is great.
5747770	eng	Everyone else is dying.
5747773	eng	El Niño will continue.
5747774	eng	Tom is absolutely livid.
5747775	eng	Each year is different.
5747776	eng	Drain any excess water.
5747781	eng	Don't be too impressed.
5747784	eng	Do people still listen?
5747787	eng	Curtains would be nice.
5747790	eng	Cookie hated his owner.
5747794	eng	Cars today are amazing.
5747796	eng	Can't they do anything?
5747800	eng	Can it possibly happen?
5747801	eng	Tom injured a co-worker.
5747813	eng	Tom has these qualities.
5747814	eng	Anyone can manage that.
5747815	eng	Anyone can beat anyone.
5747816	eng	Tom has stumbled before.
5747819	eng	Tom has since remarried.
5747821	eng	You've paid your dues.
5747822	eng	Tom has seen everything.
5747823	eng	You're not so special.
5747826	eng	You people are morons.
5747827	eng	You people are insane.
5747828	eng	Tom has enough problems.
5747831	eng	Tom has ambitious goals.
5747835	eng	You have no influence.
5747836	eng	You guys looked great.
5747838	eng	You didn't learn much.
5747841	eng	You can't possibly go.
5747846	eng	Tom had plastic surgery.
5747847	eng	Why shouldn't we sing?
5747848	eng	Why shop there anyway?
5747851	eng	Who's the best lawyer?
5747852	eng	Tom had different ideas.
5747853	eng	Who will remember you?
5747854	eng	Who was following who?
5747859	eng	Where is your dignity?
5747860	eng	Where are my crutches?
5747862	eng	What's your dream job?
5747864	eng	Tom granted the request.
5747865	eng	What's the real story?
5747866	eng	What's our excuse now?
5747868	eng	What's new about that?
5747869	eng	What's fun about that?
5747871	eng	What were they served?
5747872	eng	What were the results?
5747874	eng	What was their agenda?
5747878	eng	What nonsense is this?
5747881	eng	What does that entail?
5747884	eng	What are we expecting?
5747885	eng	Tom drove straight home.
5747891	eng	Tom doesn't play enough.
5747892	eng	We're taking our time.
5747894	eng	Tom doesn't get excited.
5747895	eng	We're not yet certain.
5747897	eng	Tom doesn't charge much.
5747899	eng	We're in good company.
5747900	eng	Tom does it beautifully.
5747902	eng	We're based in Boston.
5747903	eng	Tom does beautiful work.
5747904	eng	We're asking for help.
5747907	eng	We'll never change it.
5747910	eng	We'll find out Monday.
5747911	eng	We'll be staying home.
5747912	eng	Tom didn't stick around.
5747914	eng	We won't survive here.
5747915	eng	Tom didn't perform well.
5747916	eng	We were quite alarmed.
5747918	eng	Tom didn't even protest.
5747919	eng	We welcome your input.
5747921	eng	Tom didn't confirm that.
5747922	eng	We want to contribute.
5747924	eng	Tom didn't ask anything.
5747926	eng	We treasure our trees.
5747931	eng	We remember the chaos.
5747932	eng	We played pretty hard.
5747935	eng	We play well together.
5747936	eng	Tom couldn't get enough.
5747939	eng	Tom confessed his guilt.
5747940	eng	We looked pretty good.
5747941	eng	We learned our lesson.
5747942	eng	Tom certainly can relax.
5747944	eng	We know what's coming.
5747945	eng	Tom caught me off-guard.
5747947	eng	We kept plugging away.
5747948	eng	Tom can't intimidate us.
5747951	eng	Tom can't intimidate me.
5747954	eng	Tom can't drink alcohol.
5747959	eng	We have joint custody.
5747960	eng	Tom came away impressed.
5747961	eng	We have an eyewitness.
5747963	eng	Tom believes he's ready.
5747969	eng	Tom attempted to escape.
5747970	eng	We don't support this.
5747971	eng	We don't like changes.
5747973	eng	We don't have answers.
5747975	eng	Tom always surprises me.
5747977	eng	We can't trust anyone.
5747978	eng	Tom always studies hard.
5747979	eng	We can't control them.
5747981	eng	Tom adjusted quite well.
5747982	eng	We aren't yet perfect.
5747983	eng	We all recognize that.
5747984	eng	Tom absolutely loved it.
5747985	eng	We all have favorites.
5747991	eng	Today is no exception.
5747992	eng	Today has been slower.
5747995	eng	This would be fitting.
5747997	eng	This should stop them.
5748000	eng	This makes us winners.
5748001	eng	This makes me hopeful.
5748002	eng	Is Tom already employed?
5748003	eng	This lesson is boring.
5748012	eng	This is really doable.
5748023	eng	I remember watching Tom.
5748025	eng	This article is wrong.
5748026	eng	I remember Tom laughing.
5748028	eng	They've refused do so.
5748030	eng	They were very amused.
5748033	eng	They were normal kids.
5748034	eng	They were much higher.
5748039	eng	They never lost touch.
5748042	eng	They lost that series.
5748043	eng	They just want change.
5748051	eng	There goes my weekend.
5748052	eng	Their logic is stupid.
5748054	eng	Their bond was strong.
5748138	eng	The team was terrible.
5748139	eng	The situation is ugly.
5748141	eng	The results were good.
5748142	eng	The regime has fallen.
5748143	eng	Everyone knows it's Tom.
5748144	eng	The public knows that.
5748145	eng	The process was quick.
5748146	eng	Didn't Tom predict that?
5748148	eng	The offer was refused.
5748150	eng	The motive is unknown.
5748151	eng	The money is terrible.
5748153	eng	The meetings are over.
5748154	eng	The list is limitless.
5748156	eng	The list is extensive.
5748159	eng	The house was trashed.
5748162	eng	The flood was massive.
5748163	eng	The fastest team wins.
5748164	eng	What'll you drink, Tom?
5748165	eng	The end came suddenly.
5748166	eng	The data is promising.
5748168	eng	The comparison is apt.
5748169	eng	The cleanup went well.
5748170	eng	Welcome back home, Tom.
5748171	eng	The children are gone.
5748172	eng	The bill went through.
5748173	eng	We're quieter than Tom.
5748174	eng	The band played Dixie.
5748175	eng	The attack was foiled.
5748181	eng	That's pretty much it.
5748186	eng	That'll be a disaster.
5748187	eng	That wasn't too smart.
5748188	eng	We couldn't locate Tom.
5748189	eng	That was our thinking.
5748191	eng	Tom, you're a disgrace.
5748197	eng	Tom's speech came last.
5748198	eng	That still holds true.
5748200	eng	Tom's problem is money.
5748201	eng	That really helped us.
5748202	eng	That part was awesome.
5748203	eng	Tom's heart was broken.
5748204	eng	That money was repaid.
5748205	eng	That makes good sense.
5748206	eng	Tom's hair looks dirty.
5748207	eng	That gap is narrowing.
5748208	eng	That could be painful.
5748209	eng	Tom's gate wasn't open.
5748212	eng	Tom yelled Mary's name.
5748214	eng	Thank God you're here.
5748215	eng	Tom would go ballistic.
5748216	eng	Stop being the victim.
5748219	eng	Singing is my passion.
5748221	eng	Tom won't visit Boston.
5748222	eng	Send us your reaction.
5748223	eng	Safety is an illusion.
5748227	eng	Tom will provide music.
5748229	eng	Please stop boring us.
5748231	eng	Please make it happen.
5748233	eng	Tom wasn't too pleased.
5748234	eng	Phone calls were made.
5748236	eng	Tom was well disguised.
5748237	eng	People are so selfish.
5748238	eng	People are so helpful.
5748239	eng	Tom was something else.
5748243	eng	Our work begins today.
5748244	eng	Our method is working.
5748247	eng	Now I feel threatened.
5748250	eng	No service is planned.
5748254	eng	Tom was less fortunate.
5748257	eng	Tom was later arrested.
5748261	eng	My schedule is insane.
5748262	eng	My marks were average.
5748264	eng	My knee keeps hurting.
5748265	eng	My job doesn't change.
5748267	eng	My intuition says yes.
5748268	eng	My decision was final.
5748271	eng	My brother has autism.
5748273	eng	Money isn't a problem.
5748274	eng	Meetings are going on.
5748279	eng	Many were turned away.
5748282	eng	Let's see some action.
5748284	eng	Tom was always working.
5748285	eng	Let's learn from this.
5748289	eng	Let the market decide.
5748293	eng	Tom wanted his freedom.
5748294	eng	Last year was torture.
5748295	eng	Last night went great.
5748296	eng	Tom walked away unhurt.
5748297	eng	Just flush the toilet.
5748301	eng	It's starting to work.
5748303	eng	It's not the Olympics.
5748305	eng	Tom trembled with fear.
5748316	eng	It's bigger than that.
5748318	eng	It's been really good.
5748323	eng	Tom stopped teasing me.
5748324	eng	It's a hopeless cause.
5748325	eng	It's a crime actually.
5748326	eng	Tom sprang into action.
5748328	eng	It'll be the opposite.
5748329	eng	Tom sounds pretty dumb.
5748331	eng	It was very upsetting.
5748332	eng	Tom soon followed suit.
5748333	eng	It was very important.
5748335	eng	Tom should verify that.
5748338	eng	Tom saw it differently.
5748339	eng	It was really surreal.
5748340	eng	It was really obvious.
5748342	eng	It was really intense.
5748343	eng	It was really awesome.
5748345	eng	It was quite ordinary.
5748347	eng	Tom refused to conform.
5748348	eng	It was pretty serious.
5748349	eng	It was pretty intense.
5748350	eng	Tom really played well.
5748351	eng	It was pretty awesome.
5748352	eng	It was dangerous duty.
5748358	eng	It sure beats working.
5748360	eng	It really was amazing.
5748363	eng	It really is terrific.
5748364	eng	It really is shameful.
5748365	eng	Tom never reached home.
5748367	eng	It really bothered me.
5748369	eng	It makes it difficult.
5748370	eng	It makes a difference.
5748377	eng	Tom needs serious help.
5748379	eng	It has hardly changed.
5748380	eng	Tom needs more surgery.
5748381	eng	It gave me goosebumps.
5748383	eng	Tom makes a difference.
5748384	eng	It doesn't look great.
5748387	eng	Is there another door?
5748388	eng	Is the report genuine?
5748389	eng	Tom loved his children.
5748390	eng	Is the facility clean?
5748393	eng	Is everyone cool here?
5748394	eng	I've taken the plunge.
5748396	eng	I've not been briefed.
5748402	eng	I've come full circle.
5748403	eng	I've been sick lately.
5748404	eng	Tom learned his lesson.
5748406	eng	I've been enjoying it.
5748407	eng	Tom lasted three hours.
5748409	eng	I've always said that.
5748410	eng	Tom knows his football.
5748412	eng	I've always been sure.
5748414	eng	I've actually done it.
5748418	eng	I'm used to traveling.
5748419	eng	Tom kept plugging away.
5748420	eng	I'm unwilling to work.
5748422	eng	Tom just couldn't stop.
5748424	eng	I'm sure it'll happen.
5748432	eng	I'm now taking orders.
5748433	eng	I'm not wearing pants.
5748435	eng	I'm not taking credit.
5748436	eng	I'm not into baseball.
5748468	eng	The curtain can burn.
5748842	eng	I felt the same.
5748956	eng	Please don't bother me.
5748989	eng	Tom is walking already.
5748991	eng	I'm here with someone.
5748992	eng	Tom is under suspicion.
5749455	eng	Stop acting the goat!
5749501	eng	Wow! Pianos are expensive.
5749805	eng	German winters are cold.
5749812	eng	He probably got dumped.
5749813	eng	She probably got dumped.
5749821	eng	I got dumped, again.
5749827	eng	Your situation isn't hopeless.
5749935	eng	You are my brother.
5749937	eng	You are my children.
5749939	eng	He is my son.
5749941	eng	She is my mother-in-law.
5749946	eng	Is he my grandfather?
5749949	eng	Isn't she your grandmother?
5749954	eng	He's not his brother-in-law.
5749974	eng	The weather didn't clear.
5749978	eng	I am a carpenter.
5750037	eng	What's your favourite colour?
5750155	eng	God heard our prayers.
5751271	eng	My situation is hopeless.
5751381	eng	Now I'm flat broke!
5751667	eng	She will have enough.
5751669	eng	Tom would have enough.
5751679	eng	Salvation is God's affair.
5751805	eng	It happened last year.
5751919	eng	I'm getting choked up.
5751922	eng	I'm done with arguing.
5751925	eng	I'm an outdoor person.
5751927	eng	I'm afraid of thunder.
5751931	eng	I'm a rational person.
5751932	eng	Tom is still undecided.
5751934	eng	I'll be there forever.
5751940	eng	I'd kill myself first.
5751941	eng	Tom is slightly unwell.
5751943	eng	I'd certainly buy one.
5751944	eng	Tom is rather handsome.
5751947	eng	Tom is rather clueless.
5751949	eng	I was totally serious.
5751951	eng	I was totally puzzled.
5751953	eng	Tom is quite concerned.
5751958	eng	I was just dumfounded.
5751959	eng	Tom is poorly educated.
5751960	eng	I was just devastated.
5751971	eng	Tom is no conservative.
5751972	eng	I think it's sensible.
5751973	eng	I think it's personal.
5751984	eng	I share your thoughts.
5751985	eng	I receive food stamps.
5751986	eng	Tom is happily married.
5751994	eng	I mean that seriously.

5752014	eng	I have some arthritis.
5752015	eng	I have mixed emotions.
5752017	eng	I have great memories.
5752018	eng	I have grave concerns.
5752020	eng	I have enough friends.
5752033	eng	I find it interesting.
5752036	eng	I feel more energized.
5752046	eng	Tom hit the bull's-eye.
5752047	eng	I called the Jacksons.
5752048	eng	I appreciate the idea.
5752050	eng	I applaud your intent.
5752052	eng	Tom hesitated at first.
5752053	eng	How widespread was it?
5752054	eng	How many are teachers?
5752059	eng	How could they forget?
5752064	eng	Tom has proven himself.
5752070	eng	Tom has other concerns.
5752073	eng	Tom has no self-esteem.
5752074	eng	Help wherever you can.

5752092	eng	Fresh food is healthy.
5752093	eng	Follow us on Facebook.
5752095	eng	Fishing has been slow.
5752101	eng	Everything is so good.
5752102	eng	Everyone can see that.
5752103	eng	Tom got too complacent.
5752104	eng	Everybody has a story.
5752105	eng	Every tent was filled.
5752109	eng	Tom gave me confidence.
5752110	eng	Don't ever doubt that.
5752112	eng	Tom fit in beautifully.
5752113	eng	Do you have cellulite?
5752115	eng	Tom fired the attorney.
5752117	eng	Do they share secrets?
5752118	eng	Tom expected the worst.
5752120	eng	Discipline is the key.
5752122	eng	Did this thing happen?
5752123	eng	Delivery is six weeks.
5752124	eng	Tom dismissed the idea.
5752126	eng	Compromise can be had.
5752128	eng	Click below to listen.
5752129	eng	Can't we be grown-ups?
5752131	eng	Can you write cursive?
5752132	eng	Can you play football?
5752136	eng	Tom didn't feel wanted.
5752141	eng	Better days are ahead.
5752143	eng	Beer makes me smarter.
5752145	eng	Tom couldn't afford it.
5752149	eng	Are you employed here?
5752151	eng	Tom could only chuckle.
5752153	eng	Are there any options?
5752154	eng	Tom could've shot me.
5752156	eng	Any advice would help.
5752157	eng	Tom continued doing it.
5752158	eng	Allow me to elucidate.
5752161	eng	You've upset my life.
5752162	eng	You're my hero today.
5752164	eng	You're late for work.
5752165	eng	You're in my prayers.
5752168	eng	You weren't at fault.
5752169	eng	Tom came directly home.
5752170	eng	You people are scary.
5752172	eng	Tom broke out laughing.
5752179	eng	You could argue that.
5752180	eng	You can change lives.
5752182	eng	Why would you change?
5752186	eng	Why blame the victim?
5752188	eng	Why aren't they dead?
5752189	eng	Why are we suffering?
5752190	eng	Tom became very scared.
5752191	eng	Why are we different?
5752192	eng	Who's ready to dance?
5752194	eng	Who's ready for that?
5752195	eng	Who will outwit whom?
5752202	eng	This wasn't Tom's plan.
5752203	eng	Who are these rebels?
5752204	eng	Who are their heroes?
5752206	eng	Where does that lead?
5752207	eng	Whatever shall we do?
5752210	eng	What's in your heart?
5752216	eng	What makes it unique?
5752217	eng	Please don't adopt Tom.
5752222	eng	We've joked about it.

5752225	eng	We're trying so hard.
5752227	eng	We're still with you.
5752230	eng	We're planning on it.
5752234	eng	We're not going away.
5752237	eng	We're not against it.
5752246	eng	We're a little older.
5752248	eng	We'll wait till then.
5752249	eng	We'll try to survive.
5752251	eng	We'll try again soon.
5752252	eng	We'll leave it there.
5752253	eng	I greeted Tom casually.
5752254	eng	We'll keep it simple.
5752255	eng	We'll just ignore it.
5752257	eng	We'll get through it.
5752260	eng	We'd better get away.
5752261	eng	We won't accept this.
5752263	eng	We won't accept that.
5752264	eng	We were real anxious.
5752266	eng	We were looking good.
5752269	eng	We talked about jobs.
5752271	eng	You probably love Tom.
5752272	eng	We should meet again.
5752273	eng	We played very badly.
5752275	eng	We never got rattled.
5752276	eng	We needed a response.
5752279	eng	We need good hygiene.
5752281	eng	We need better focus.
5752284	eng	We must provide jobs.
5752285	eng	We must prevent this.
5752286	eng	Tom's home was burned.
5752291	eng	We just kept pushing.
5752292	eng	Tom's fate is unknown.
5752293	eng	We've lost our way.
5752295	eng	Tom's case is pending.
5752298	eng	Tom wouldn't allow it.
5752302	eng	We fit together well.
5752303	eng	We felt the momentum.
5752304	eng	Tom will pitch Monday.
5752305	eng	We don't cut corners.
5752306	eng	We don't accept that.
5752308	eng	We didn't get caught.
5752311	eng	We care about people.
5752313	eng	Tom wept with emotion.
5752315	eng	We can't attack them.
5752317	eng	We can make mistakes.
5752318	eng	We can consider that.
5752320	eng	We built it together.
5752322	eng	Tom was treated there.
5752323	eng	Victory will be ours.
5752325	eng	Tom was still staring.
5752326	eng	Trust goes both ways.
5752327	eng	Too bad nobody cares.
5752328	eng	Tom was still outside.
5752329	eng	This team is amazing.
5752330	eng	This story is absurd.
5752331	eng	Tom was soon arrested.
5752334	eng	Tom was so flamboyant.
5752335	eng	This much is certain.
5752340	eng	Tom was pretty bummed.
5752341	eng	This is so dangerous.
5752344	eng	This is no different.
5752345	eng	This is mind blowing.
5752346	eng	Tom was never content.
5752347	eng	This is long overdue.
5752349	eng	Tom was never charged.
5752354	eng	This is an injustice.
5752357	eng	This breaks my heart.
5752359	eng	Things stay the same.
5752360	eng	Things can get hairy.
5752362	eng	They're not back yet.
5752365	eng	They were so excited.
5752366	eng	They were plain folk.
5752367	eng	Tom was correct today.
5752368	eng	They needed more men.
5752369	eng	They must be freaked.
5752371	eng	They must be crushed.
5752372	eng	They love their home.
5752375	eng	They lived in Boston.
5752377	eng	They live hard lives.
5752380	eng	They just kept dying.
5752381	eng	They have veto power.
5752382	eng	Tom wanted to succeed.
5752383	eng	They have their work.
5752384	eng	They had no children.
5752387	eng	They get along great.
5752389	eng	They deserved to win.
5752390	eng	They can do anything.
5752392	eng	There's room to grow.
5752393	eng	There's no wait time.
5752395	eng	There will be debate.
5752398	eng	There is no tomorrow.
5752399	eng	There can be dangers.
5752400	eng	Tom survived his wife.
5752401	eng	There are no threats.
5752402	eng	The world awaits you.
5752403	eng	Tom suddenly fell ill.
5752404	eng	The words are simple.
5752405	eng	The wind was blowing.
5752407	eng	The wind grew cooler.
5752408	eng	The win felt amazing.
5752410	eng	The town is deserted.
5752411	eng	The rules are absurd.
5752412	eng	Tom smoothed his hair.
5752413	eng	The pubs were packed.
5752414	eng	The match was Monday.
5752417	eng	The loss is enormous.
5752418	eng	Tom showed no remorse.
5752419	eng	The list was endless.
5752420	eng	The future is bright.
5752421	eng	Tom shouldn't be long.
5752422	eng	The election is over.
5752423	eng	The case was dropped.
5752426	eng	That's our last hope.
5752427	eng	Tom should keep clear.
5752429	eng	That would help also.
5752430	eng	Tom should be charged.
5752432	eng	That was really cute.
5752433	eng	Tom shall be punished.
5752434	eng	That was our mindset.
5752435	eng	That was my strength.
5752436	eng	Tom settled in Boston.
5752437	eng	That was my approach.
5752439	eng	Tom seized the moment.
5752441	eng	That much is obvious.
5752444	eng	That may be changing.
5752445	eng	Tom seems down lately.
5752446	eng	That just isn't true.
5752447	eng	That could get messy.
5752449	eng	That changed in 2013.
5752450	eng	That about covers it.
5752451	eng	Tom reviews the shows.
5752452	eng	Tell us your stories.
5752453	eng	Talk to us privately.
5752454	eng	Tom resides in Boston.
5752458	eng	Stocking up can help.
5752459	eng	Stock up on charcoal.
5752461	eng	Sorry about your son.
5752462	eng	Show us some results.
5752463	eng	Tom remains in Boston.
5752464	eng	Should we have known?
5752467	eng	Plunk down the dough.
5752470	eng	Our training is hard.
5752471	eng	Our seats were close.
5752473	eng	Our cities are dirty.
5752475	eng	Tom proved them wrong.
5752476	eng	Nobody went to class.
5752477	eng	Nobody likes a delay.
5752479	eng	Nobody is being hurt.
5752481	eng	Tom paid no attention.
5752482	eng	No gun was recovered.
5752485	eng	My, how things change!
5752486	eng	My head was spinning.
5752488	eng	My head was pounding.
5752489	eng	My eyes were dilated.
5752491	eng	My blood was boiling.
5752494	eng	Maybe this will help.
5752495	eng	Lives are being lost.
5752496	eng	Tom moves really well.
5752497	eng	Life is so important.
5752498	eng	Let's wrap things up.
5752500	eng	Let's start the show.
5752501	eng	Let's see your proof.
5752889	eng	She was from Eriskay.
5752893	eng	Tom is from Eriskay.
5753124	eng	Why aren't you listening?
5753202	eng	Just stop it already.
5753203	eng	Tom may be imprisoned.
5753204	eng	Just look around you.
5753206	eng	Tom married too young.
5753209	eng	Tom loved those jeans.
5753210	eng	It's the ideal place.
5753215	eng	Tom looked good today.
5753216	eng	It's an open meeting.
5753219	eng	It's a great feeling.
5753220	eng	It's a fair question.
5753223	eng	It was something new.
5753225	eng	It was so depressing.
5753226	eng	It was sheer torture.
5753228	eng	It was pretty strong.
5753229	eng	It was pretty somber.
5753231	eng	It was pretty solemn.
5753232	eng	It was pretty brutal.
5753234	eng	It was just fabulous.
5753235	eng	It was entirely fair.
5753236	eng	Tom knelt beside Mary.
5753238	eng	It should be stopped.
5753240	eng	It should be illegal.
5753241	eng	It should be allowed.
5753242	eng	Tom killed his mother.
5753245	eng	Tom kicked the bucket.
5753247	eng	It makes you curious.
5753248	eng	Tom keeps bad company.
5753249	eng	It makes us stronger.
5753250	eng	It makes me nauseous.
5753251	eng	Tom just wasn't ready.
5753252	eng	It made people smile.
5753254	eng	Tom joined the revolt.
5753255	eng	It helps our economy.
5753259	eng	It can be negotiated.
5753261	eng	It can be exhausting.
5753263	eng	Tom isn't a physician.
5753265	eng	It all came together.
5753266	eng	Tom is well connected.
5753269	eng	Tom is very versatile.
5753270	eng	Is that even allowed?
5753272	eng	Tom is totally biased.
5753279	eng	I've lived in Boston.
5753281	eng	Tom is still learning.
5753284	eng	Tom is still critical.
5753285	eng	I'm ready for spring.
5753288	eng	I'm pretty shaken up.
5753289	eng	I'm prepared to wait.
5753290	eng	Tom is something else.
5753293	eng	Tom is so competitive.
5753295	eng	I'm just goofing off.
5753297	eng	I'm going on holiday.
5753298	eng	I'm eating over here.
5753299	eng	Tom is slightly scary.
5753301	eng	I'm about to explode.
5753302	eng	Tom is sitting pretty.
5753304	eng	I'll get the popcorn.
5753305	eng	Tom is sadly mistaken.
5753309	eng	I withdrew the offer.
5753312	eng	I was totally bummed.
5753315	eng	I was perfectly fine.
5753321	eng	I was being generous.
5753322	eng	I was always dubious.
5753326	eng	Tom is making excuses.
5753327	eng	I want to experiment.
5753328	eng	I understand my role.
5753332	eng	Tom is equally guilty.
5753334	eng	I think we're better.
5753336	eng	I think the opposite.
5753338	eng	Tom is considering it.
5753339	eng	I think it'll happen.
5753341	eng	Tom is branch manager.
5753344	eng	Tom is below contempt.
5753347	eng	Tom is being cremated.
5753348	eng	I signed the release.
5753351	eng	I read the complaint.
5753355	eng	I needed expert help.
5753358	eng	I must've been woozy.
5753360	eng	I must've been angry.
5753363	eng	I might've missed it.
5753364	eng	I loved your article.
5753366	eng	I loved every second.
5753369	eng	I love this business.
5753370	eng	I love the questions.
5753372	eng	I love the attention.
5753374	eng	Tom is a musicologist.
5753375	eng	I live very modestly.
5753378	eng	I learned what works.
5753387	eng	I just kept paddling.
5753388	eng	I just felt terrible.
5753391	eng	I just answered that.
5753393	eng	I haven't been brave.
5753394	eng	I have the paperwork.
5753395	eng	Tom helped his father.
5753396	eng	I have other hobbies.
5753397	eng	I hated that feeling.
5753398	eng	Tom held Mary hostage.
5753399	eng	I had trouble coping.
5753403	eng	I gave my permission.
5753405	eng	I found it uplifting.
5753406	eng	I feel very peaceful.
5753407	eng	Tom has since retired.
5753408	eng	I expect much better.
5753409	eng	I donate every month.
5753410	eng	Tom has perfect teeth.
5753411	eng	I don't vote anymore.
5753412	eng	I don't support that.
5753413	eng	Tom has never married.
5753414	eng	I don't repair shoes.
5753415	eng	I didn't think twice.
5753417	eng	I didn't feel normal.
5753419	eng	Tom has escaped again.
5753421	eng	I certainly feel bad.
5753422	eng	Tom has been recalled.
5753424	eng	I became a homeowner.
5753425	eng	Tom has been homeless.
5753428	eng	Tom has been cremated.
5753430	eng	How widespread is it?
5753432	eng	How unlikely is this?
5753437	eng	Tom had panic attacks.
5753442	eng	How did that develop?
5753445	eng	Hey, this is working.
5753447	eng	Having money is good.
5753448	eng	Has the work started?
5753450	eng	Gold is going higher.
5753451	eng	God will forgive you.
5753455	eng	Tom got all emotional.
5753456	eng	Gather up your stuff.
5753457	eng	Follow us on Twitter.
5753460	eng	Everyone has a voice.
5753462	eng	Everyone has a price.
5753464	eng	Tom gave Mary nothing.
5753468	eng	Does this hold water?
5753472	eng	Closing is an option.
5753473	eng	Tom escaped on Monday.
5753476	eng	Tom emptied his glass.
5753477	eng	Checks can be cashed.
5753478	eng	Cancer might kill me.
5753479	eng	Tom doesn't answer me.
5753480	eng	Can you justify that?
5753481	eng	Can you do something?
5753482	eng	Tom does it naturally.
5753484	eng	Can this happen here?
5753485	eng	Tom directed the show.
5753487	eng	Can anyone beat this?
5753489	eng	Bring me my children.
5753493	eng	Anyone up for tennis?
5753568	eng	All ages are welcome.
5753570	eng	Tom died October 20th.
5753573	eng	Tom didn't even speak.
5753574	eng	Your hands are tied.
5753575	eng	Your conduct is sad.
5753576	eng	Tom didn't even blink.
5753577	eng	You've hurt me, too.
5753580	eng	You're a bad person.
5753581	eng	You'll have my vote.
5753582	eng	Tom deserves his rest.
5753583	eng	You just never know.
5753587	eng	You have been duped.
5753588	eng	Tom decided to retire.
5753589	eng	You have an admirer.
5753591	eng	Tom decided to attack.
5753592	eng	You guys were tough.
5753595	eng	You can cut corners.
5753597	eng	Tom could hardly miss.
5753599	eng	Will anybody get it?
5753600	eng	Tom could do anything.
5753601	eng	Why all the mystery?
5753602	eng	Why all the fanfare?
5753605	eng	Who has it affected?
5753606	eng	Tom changed our world.
5753607	eng	Who does that leave?
5753608	eng	Where is this going?
5753609	eng	Tom changed his story.
5753612	eng	Tom can't comment now.
5753614	eng	What happened to us?
5753615	eng	Tom can't answer that.
5753616	eng	What gives you hope?
5753617	eng	What are your views?
5753619	eng	What are your hours?
5753621	eng	Tom can do everything.
5753623	eng	We're short of food.
5753625	eng	We're on full alert.
5753712	eng	Tom brought some beer.
5753713	eng	We're not buying it.
5753714	eng	We're like a family.
5753715	eng	Tom brought Mary home.
5753717	eng	We'll never go away.
5753718	eng	Tom broke down crying.
5753719	eng	We wish you success.
5753720	eng	We were so grateful.
5753723	eng	We were just sloppy.
5753724	eng	Tom became an outcast.
5753726	eng	We were all retired.
5753727	eng	Tom attained his goal.
5753728	eng	We screwed up there.
5753730	eng	Tom acted as chairman.
5753734	eng	We promise you that.
5753737	eng	We need your photos.
5753741	eng	We need some action.
5753743	eng	We need more divers.
5753744	eng	We need more action.
5753749	eng	We need a coalition.
5753750	eng	We may have changed.
5753753	eng	We learned by doing.
5753755	eng	We know the pattern.
5753756	eng	We know the feeling.
5753757	eng	I sometimes watch Tom.
5753758	eng	We know the dangers.
5753759	eng	We jumped the fence.
5753760	eng	I personally know Tom.
5753761	eng	We hurt one another.
5753762	eng	We have approved it.
5753764	eng	We have air support.
5753765	eng	We had wooden boats.
5753767	eng	We had the training.
5753768	eng	We got that changed.
5753770	eng	We don't feel safer.
5753771	eng	We don't believe it.
5753916	eng	We do things better.
5753917	eng	We do have concerns.
5753919	eng	We did that tonight.
5753923	eng	We both played well.
5753925	eng	Two will be elected.
5753926	eng	Traffic may back up.
5753928	eng	Three men were lost.
5753929	eng	Those days are over.
5753931	eng	Those days are gone.
5753932	eng	This made me flinch.
5753935	eng	This is way overdue.
5753937	eng	This is very common.
5753938	eng	This is just insane.
5753940	eng	This is indeed true.
5753943	eng	This event was lame.
5753944	eng	Think hard about it.
5753947	eng	They're all at risk.
5753948	eng	Can anybody blame Tom?
5753949	eng	They must be losing.
5753950	eng	They looked so nice.
5753951	eng	Will Tom take action?
5753953	eng	They led full lives.
5753954	eng	Who knew Tom painted?
5753955	eng	They had no success.
5753956	eng	They get stuff done.
5753957	eng	Who doesn't love Tom?
5753958	eng	They get each other.
5753959	eng	They each had three.
5753961	eng	They brushed me off.
5753963	eng	We never bullied Tom.
5753965	eng	There they go again.
5753966	eng	We miss Tom terribly.
5753967	eng	There is no urgency.
5753968	eng	There is a downside.
5753969	eng	Tom, you're a genius.
5753970	eng	There are no losers.
5753971	eng	Their wages went up.
5753972	eng	Tom, you astonish me.
5753973	eng	Their names are mud.
5753974	eng	The walls look good.
5754015	eng	Is the roof shingled?
5754334	eng	The tide had turned.
5754335	eng	The task isn't easy.
5754337	eng	The task isn't done.
5754338	eng	The siren is broken.
5754339	eng	Tom's voice was calm.
5754340	eng	The rivalry is real.
5754341	eng	The rest is obvious.
5754342	eng	Tom's mouth was full.
5754343	eng	The program is free.
5754344	eng	The party was great.
5754345	eng	Tom works three jobs.
5754346	eng	The money went fast.
5754347	eng	The list is growing.
5754349	eng	The hours ticked by.
5754350	eng	The game started OK.
5754352	eng	The demand is there.
5754353	eng	The crowd was great.
5754354	eng	Tom won't name names.
5754355	eng	The cops fired back.
5754356	eng	The case is complex.
5754357	eng	Tom will serve first.
5754358	eng	The car caught fire.
5754359	eng	The answer is money.
5754361	eng	That's what we have.
5754362	eng	That's what we felt.
5754365	eng	That's what dogs do.
5754366	eng	Tom went home Monday.
5754367	eng	That's the sad part.
5754368	eng	That's the goal now.
5754369	eng	Tom went beyond that.
5754370	eng	That's the fun part.
5754371	eng	That's the end goal.
5754372	eng	Tom wasn't a servant.
5754373	eng	That's the best bet.
5754374	eng	That's the bad news.
5754381	eng	Tom was the attacker.
5754382	eng	That's not quite it.
5754383	eng	That's not my point.
5754384	eng	Tom was so terrified.
5754385	eng	That's no longer so.
5754387	eng	Tom was so impressed.
5754390	eng	Tom was simply awful.
5754391	eng	That's all past now.
5754392	eng	That's all gone now.
5754431	eng	Tom was refused bail.
5754432	eng	That's a nice touch.
5754433	eng	That's a great sign.
5754434	eng	Tom was real nervous.
5754435	eng	That's a cold place.
5754438	eng	That would be folly.
5754439	eng	That was our chance.
5754441	eng	That was my promise.
5754442	eng	That was just awful.
5754443	eng	Tom was pretty tough.
5754445	eng	That list is secret.
5754447	eng	That helps for sure.
5754448	eng	That gave me chills.
5754449	eng	Tom was no different.
5754450	eng	That didn't stop me.
5754451	eng	That ain't my style.
5754453	eng	Thanks for the tips.
5754454	eng	Talk to us directly.
5754455	eng	Tom was my protector.
5754456	eng	Summer is behind us.
5754457	eng	Start your own list.
5754458	eng	Tom was made captain.
5754460	eng	Some bills can wait.
5754465	eng	Show yourself to me.
5754466	eng	Show us the results.
5754467	eng	Tom was clearly lost.
5754468	eng	Should we be silent?
5754469	eng	Should I keep going?
5754470	eng	Tom was city manager.
5754477	eng	Please call my wife.
5754483	eng	People are so funny.
5754484	eng	Our work starts now.
5754485	eng	Tom wants us working.
5754486	eng	Our goal is justice.
5754487	eng	Our aims are simple.
5754489	eng	One can always hope.
5754490	eng	OK, that settles it.
5754494	eng	Tom visited a friend.
5754495	eng	Nothing is over yet.
5754496	eng	Nobody was doing it.
5754497	eng	Tom values the truth.
5754498	eng	No place is perfect.
5754499	eng	No one ever changes.
5754500	eng	Tom trashed his room.
5754501	eng	No one even blinked.
5754502	eng	No items were taken.
5754504	eng	New laws are needed.
5754506	eng	Tom studied the menu.
5754507	eng	My uncle died there.
5754508	eng	My mom will babysit.
5754509	eng	Tom stood his ground.
5754510	eng	My life is terrible.
5754511	eng	My brain works fine.
5754512	eng	Tom still looks good.
5754513	eng	Make saving a habit.
5754515	eng	Tom stabbed his wife.
5754516	eng	Live music is great.
5754517	eng	Life was good again.
5754518	eng	Tom soon walked away.
5754519	eng	Let's pick a winner.
5754520	eng	Let's clear this up.
5754521	eng	Tom soon left Boston.
5754522	eng	Let's clear the air.
5754523	eng	Let the races begin.
5754524	eng	Tom skimmed the text.
5754525	eng	Let the fight begin.
5754526	eng	Kick off your shoes.
5754527	eng	Tom should step down.
5754528	eng	Keep your home warm.
5754529	eng	Keep praying for us.
5754531	eng	Just don't go crazy.
5754533	eng	Tom served me coffee.
5754535	eng	It's bigger than us.
5754538	eng	It's been very hard.
5754541	eng	It's a slow process.
5754543	eng	It's a safety issue.
5754544	eng	It's a rare disease.
5754546	eng	It's a package deal.
5754547	eng	It's a nice feeling.
5754549	eng	It's a long process.
5754550	eng	It's a great excuse.
5754552	eng	It's a good program.
5754553	eng	It's a good concept.
5754555	eng	It's a funny market.
5754556	eng	It's a free service.
5754557	eng	Tom really went wild.
5754558	eng	It's a crying shame.
5754562	eng	It'll still be good.
5754563	eng	Tom really feels bad.
5754564	eng	It'll be very tough.
5754566	eng	Tom reached his goal.
5754567	eng	It won't make sense.
5754568	eng	It wasn't easy work.
5754570	eng	It wasn't always so.
5754571	eng	It was very unusual.
5754572	eng	Tom quieted the dogs.
5754573	eng	It was very similar.
5754574	eng	It was very obvious.
5754576	eng	It was very fitting.
5754577	eng	It was so stressful.
5754578	eng	Tom plays third base.
5754579	eng	It was so difficult.
5754580	eng	It was so different.
5754582	eng	It was really tough.
5754583	eng	It was really great.
5754584	eng	Tom picked the fight.
5754585	eng	It was pretty smart.
5754586	eng	It was pretty rough.
5754587	eng	Tom parties too hard.
5754588	eng	It was pretty gross.
5754589	eng	It was pretty great.
5754590	eng	Tom only knew French.
5754591	eng	It was long overdue.
5754592	eng	It was like torture.
5754593	eng	Tom needs a dialysis.
5754594	eng	It was just awkward.
5754595	eng	It was just awesome.
5754596	eng	Tom muttered a curse.
5754597	eng	It was just amazing.
5754599	eng	Tom must've been ill.
5754600	eng	It was great advice.
5754602	eng	Tom motioned us away.
5754605	eng	Tom made it exciting.
5754612	eng	It took all weekend.
5754613	eng	It sounded like fun.
5754615	eng	It really helped me.
5754616	eng	It makes zero sense.
5754618	eng	It makes you wonder.
5754619	eng	It makes them crazy.
5754620	eng	Tom knows he cheated.
5754621	eng	It made us stronger.
5754622	eng	It kept me occupied.
5754623	eng	Tom knows about hope.
5754624	eng	It kept me grounded.
5754625	eng	It just makes sense.
5754626	eng	Tom kept coming back.
5754627	eng	It just feels eerie.
5754628	eng	It just doesn't fit.
5754629	eng	Tom just walked away.
5754630	eng	It got my attention.
5754633	eng	It gives me freedom.
5754634	eng	It could get bloody.
5754635	eng	Tom isn't hiding out.
5754641	eng	Tom is very gracious.
5754642	eng	Is that your advice?
5754643	eng	Is it entirely over?
5754644	eng	Tom is strong willed.
5754647	eng	Tom is skipping rope.
5754648	eng	I've used it myself.
5754649	eng	I've done it myself.
5754651	eng	I've been in prison.
5754652	eng	I'm upset at myself.
5754657	eng	I'm tall and skinny.
5754658	eng	I'm taking a chance.
5754659	eng	Tom is losing ground.
5754664	eng	I'm ready to answer.
5754665	eng	Tom is going nowhere.
5754667	eng	I'm praying for you.
5754669	eng	I'm over it already.
5754670	eng	I'm not touching it.
5754671	eng	Tom is doing penance.
5754672	eng	I'm not paying this.
5754673	eng	I'm in good company.
5754674	eng	Tom is an aristocrat.
5754675	eng	I'm fit and healthy.
5754676	eng	I'm cheating on you.
5754677	eng	Tom is always strong.
5754678	eng	I'm about to scream.
5754679	eng	I'll save the world.
5754680	eng	Tom is always scared.
5754681	eng	I'd better get busy.
5754683	eng	Tom is always honest.
5754691	eng	I want a commitment.
5754692	eng	Tom is a trendsetter.
5754694	eng	I totally forgot it.
5754702	eng	I saw the interview.
5754708	eng	I make no apologies.
5754709	eng	I love to entertain.
5754711	eng	I love this costume.
5754712	eng	I love these people.
5754714	eng	I love playing here.
5754715	eng	I literally blew it.
5754720	eng	I like that thought.
5754721	eng	I like paying taxes.
5754727	eng	I just kept walking.
5754730	eng	I just kept running.
5754732	eng	Tom himself tried it.
5754733	eng	I heard three shots.
5754734	eng	I haven't tested it.
5754735	eng	Tom hasn't been seen.
5754736	eng	I haven't seen that.
5754737	eng	I have two concerns.
5754738	eng	Tom has slanted eyes.
5754739	eng	I have one weakness.
5754740	eng	I have future goals.
5754741	eng	Tom has never hunted.
5754744	eng	Tom has more options.
5754745	eng	I fixed their wagon.
5754746	eng	I find that strange.
5754748	eng	I find it plausible.
5754749	eng	I find it hilarious.
5754751	eng	I feel very blessed.
5754752	eng	I feel more relaxed.
5754753	eng	Tom has changed that.
5754754	eng	I don't win anymore.
5754755	eng	I don't smoke crack.
5754756	eng	Tom has been trained.
5754757	eng	I don't play sports.
5754758	eng	I don't mind losing.
5754759	eng	Tom has been excused.
5754760	eng	I don't feel normal.
5754761	eng	I didn't learn much.
5754762	eng	Tom has been elected.
5754763	eng	I couldn't leave it.
5754765	eng	Tom had no neighbors.
5754770	eng	I can take anything.
5754771	eng	Tom had minor wounds.
5754773	eng	I called the office.
5754774	eng	Tom had many critics.
5754775	eng	I called my manager.
5754776	eng	I believe in people.
5754777	eng	Tom had colon cancer.
5754778	eng	I became a criminal.
5754781	eng	How would that feel?
5754782	eng	How were they found?
5754783	eng	They wanted Tom gone.
5754784	eng	How twisted is that?
5754785	eng	How strange is that?
5754786	eng	The idea shocked Tom.
5754788	eng	How perfect is that?
5754790	eng	How does life start?
5754793	eng	How could they tell?
5754794	eng	How about your wife?
5754833	eng	How about some eggs?
5754834	eng	How about right now?
5754837	eng	Here's what I wrote.
5754839	eng	Help is needed fast.
5754842	eng	Good luck, you guys.
5754843	eng	Give them your best.
5754845	eng	Give it another try.
5754846	eng	Get off your pulpit.
5754849	eng	Gambling is a curse.
5754851	eng	Forgive us for that.
5754862	eng	I kissed Mary's neck.
5754864	eng	I felt Tom's sadness.
5754865	eng	Don't miss this one.
5754866	eng	Don't make me dance.
5755084	eng	I'm not annoying anyone.
5755125	eng	We really miss Tom.
5756318	eng	Mary shaved her legs.
5756321	eng	Tom shaved his legs.
5756419	eng	This book is boring.
5756429	eng	Don't break his heart.
5756431	eng	Don't break her heart.
5756447	eng	Tom's pupils are dilated.
5756487	eng	Tom solved the puzzle.
5756560	eng	This name feels familiar.
5756585	eng	It was really soft!
5756591	eng	His opinion didn't matter.
5756593	eng	Have you got time?
5756627	eng	You are not thinking.
5756637	eng	Don't just leave it.
5756638	eng	Don't give up, ever.
5756639	eng	Does anyone know Tom?
5756641	eng	Don't fall for that.
5756643	eng	Do you like guitars?
5756647	eng	Do what excites you.
5756648	eng	A mustache suits Tom.
5756651	eng	What's left for Tom?
5756652	eng	Can you settle this?
5756653	eng	Can you afford them?
5756654	eng	What makes Tom tick?
5756656	eng	Bring our boys home.
5756657	eng	What did Tom invent?
5756658	eng	Boy were they wrong!
5756659	eng	Be true to yourself.
5756660	eng	We proved Tom wrong.
5756661	eng	Be good to yourself.
5756662	eng	Are you wealthy yet?
5756663	eng	Tom, you're a prude.
5756664	eng	Are we your enemies?
5756665	eng	Anybody want to bet?
5756666	eng	Tom's shift is over.
5756667	eng	Anybody got a hanky?
5756669	eng	Tom wore good shoes.
5756670	eng	Your idea is wrong.
5756673	eng	You're just a snob.
5756674	eng	You wanted to talk?
5756675	eng	Tom went out Monday.
5756676	eng	You made this mess.
5756677	eng	You know the story.
5756679	eng	You have to adjust.
5756680	eng	You have my answer.
5756681	eng	Tom was too liberal.
5756682	eng	You can't avoid it.
5756684	eng	Tom was teaching me.
5756685	eng	Will it get better?
5756686	eng	Why waste our time?
5756687	eng	Tom was so charming.
5756688	eng	Why so much hoopla?
5756690	eng	Tom was pretty open.
5756691	eng	Why cause an issue?
5756692	eng	Who was the victim?
5756693	eng	Tom was never clean.
5756694	eng	Who wants this job?
5756695	eng	Who should get one?
5756696	eng	Tom was my favorite.
5756698	eng	Who brought you in?
5756699	eng	Tom was home Monday.
5756700	eng	Where will that be?
5756701	eng	Where did it start?
5756703	eng	Where are the hats?
5756704	eng	When is moving day?
5756712	eng	What's in your car?
5756713	eng	What would you get?
5756714	eng	Tom texted a friend.
5756716	eng	What should you do?
5756719	eng	What good was that?
5756720	eng	Tom sobbed out loud.
5756721	eng	What did ours cost?
5756722	eng	What can stop them?
5756723	eng	Tom slept till dawn.
5756724	eng	Well, let's try it.
5756725	eng	We've held our own.
5756726	eng	Tom signed a pledge.
5756727	eng	We've heard it all.
5756728	eng	We've all moved on.
5756729	eng	Tom served one term.
5756730	eng	We're still at war.
5756732	eng	Tom remains in jail.
5756733	eng	We're on track now.
5756734	eng	We're on a mission.
5756737	eng	We're all fired up.
5756739	eng	We won't be judged.
5756740	eng	We won't back down.
5756741	eng	Tom ran three miles.
5756742	eng	We were tough guys.
5756744	eng	Tom purchased a wig.
5756745	eng	We were pretty bad.
5756747	eng	Tom picked the song.
5756748	eng	We were huge wimps.
5756749	eng	We stayed in touch.
5756751	eng	We push each other.
5756752	eng	We proved it today.
5756753	eng	Tom often said that.
5756754	eng	We never got there.
5756755	eng	We needed the rain.
5756756	eng	Tom never went back.
5756757	eng	We mustn't do that.
5756758	eng	We love your books.
5756759	eng	Tom never felt fear.
5756760	eng	We love the system.
5756761	eng	We live in poverty.
5756762	eng	Tom never came over.
5756763	eng	We like to compete.
5756765	eng	Tom missed his kids.
5756766	eng	We just can't quit.
5756768	eng	Tom makes us better.
5756769	eng	We have a shortage.
5756770	eng	We had to scramble.
5756771	eng	Tom makes me better.
5756772	eng	We had the passion.
5756773	eng	We had the chances.
5756774	eng	Tom made some flubs.
5756775	eng	We had huge losses.
5756776	eng	We got lucky there.
5756778	eng	We go out together.
5756781	eng	We don't want pork.
5756782	eng	We don't know that.
5756783	eng	Tom looks very good.
5756784	eng	We don't accept it.
5756785	eng	We didn't get that.
5756787	eng	We couldn't go out.
5756788	eng	We can't lose hope.
5756789	eng	Tom liked the scarf.
5756790	eng	We can't help that.
5756791	eng	We can hardly wait.
5756794	eng	We can accept that.
5756796	eng	We beat them twice.
5756797	eng	We always eat well.
5756799	eng	We all played well.
5756801	eng	Tom left in disgust.
5756804	eng	Tom knows no French.
5756805	eng	Time will fix this.
5756806	eng	Throw them all out.
5756807	eng	Tom killed his wife.
5756808	eng	This world is sick.
5756809	eng	This won't go away.
5756810	eng	Tom just kept going.
5756811	eng	This topic is lame.
5756812	eng	This team is tough.
5756813	eng	Tom isn't with them.
5756814	eng	This seems to help.
5756815	eng	This law is insane.
5756816	eng	Tom isn't buying it.
5756817	eng	This isn't all bad.
5756818	eng	This isn't a fluke.
5756819	eng	Tom isn't all there.
5756820	eng	This is what works.
5756821	eng	This is so surreal.
5756822	eng	Tom isn't a recluse.
5756823	eng	This is our moment.
5756824	eng	This is our legacy.
5756825	eng	Tom is watching you.
5756826	eng	This is my opinion.
5756827	eng	This is like magic.
5756828	eng	Tom is very complex.
5756829	eng	This is killing me.
5756831	eng	Tom is very chipper.
5756832	eng	This is an extract.
5756833	eng	This is an anomaly.
5756835	eng	This is all stupid.
5756836	eng	This is a computer.
5756837	eng	Tom is still nimble.
5756839	eng	This could get bad.
5756841	eng	This could be huge.
5756842	eng	Things come and go.
5756846	eng	Tom is now deceased.
5756848	eng	They won't tell us.
5756849	eng	Tom is no gentleman.
5756850	eng	They were so heavy.
5756851	eng	They never said no.
5756852	eng	Tom is no exception.
5756853	eng	They make me laugh.
5756855	eng	Tom is no economist.
5756856	eng	They can all shoot.
5756857	eng	They beat us badly.
5756858	eng	Tom is no different.
5756860	eng	They all did great.
5756863	eng	Their logic was OK.
5756867	eng	Tom is good company.
5756868	eng	The search is over.
5756869	eng	The room got quiet.
5756870	eng	Tom is eating bread.
5756872	eng	The meat was burnt.
5756874	eng	The match was over.
5756876	eng	Tom is always great.
5756877	eng	The gap has closed.
5756880	eng	The birds took off.
5756883	eng	That's not any fun.
5756885	eng	Tom is a lieutenant.
5756886	eng	That's no easy job.
5756888	eng	Tom is a fishmonger.
5756889	eng	That's just no fun.
5756890	eng	That's hard to get.
5756891	eng	Tom is a competitor.
5756892	eng	That's good for us.
5756894	eng	Tom himself said so.
5756895	eng	That's a done deal.
5756897	eng	Tom helped the kids.
5756898	eng	That'll be the day.
5756899	eng	That will never do.
5756900	eng	Tom has some advice.
5756901	eng	That song is corny.
5756902	eng	That risk paid off.
5756903	eng	It's an unpredictable market.
5756970	eng	He lost a watch.
5756973	eng	Some woman called you.
5756978	eng	Music doesn't know borders.
5757041	eng	Look, an apricot tree!
5757060	eng	Look, a rose acacia!
5757112	eng	Look, a lowbush cranberry!
5757339	eng	Tom has our support.
5757340	eng	That may sound odd.
5757341	eng	That kind of sucks.
5757342	eng	Tom has no backbone.
5757345	eng	Tom has his critics.
5757346	eng	Thank God for that.
5757347	eng	Tell us your story.
5757348	eng	Tom has gone cuckoo.
5757349	eng	Stick to your guns.
5757351	eng	Tom has few friends.
5757354	eng	Tom has earned this.
5757355	eng	School was my life.
5757356	eng	Please tell me why.
5757357	eng	Tom has admitted it.
5757360	eng	Tom has a following.
5757361	eng	Only time can tell.
5757363	eng	Tom had seen enough.
5757364	eng	Nothing came of it.
5757365	eng	None of them spoke.
5757367	eng	No deal was struck.
5757368	eng	My roots are there.
5757369	eng	Tom got lunch ready.
5757370	eng	My goals are lofty.
5757371	eng	My brother uses it.
5757373	eng	Money is no object.
5757375	eng	Tom doesn't do that.
5757376	eng	Maybe it's just me.
5757377	eng	Look who I married.
5757379	eng	Long live the king.
5757380	eng	Live while you can.
5757382	eng	Life is so strange.
5757383	eng	Life is a delusion.
5757385	eng	Let's not be catty.
5757386	eng	Let's do it anyway.
5757387	eng	Tom didn't call 911.
5757388	eng	Let's be real here.
5757389	eng	Let the show begin.
5757390	eng	Tom didn't back off.
5757391	eng	Let me repeat this.
5757392	eng	Let me repeat that.
5757393	eng	Tom comes on strong.
5757394	eng	Let me just finish.
5757396	eng	Tom chased after me.
5757397	eng	Legal help is here.
5757400	eng	Tom can change that.
5757401	eng	Just think of that.
5757403	eng	Tom brought us home.
5757405	eng	It's really a must.
5757406	eng	Tom blocked the ball.
5757407	eng	It's our last hope.
5757409	eng	Tom belongs with us.
5757410	eng	It's not too fancy.
5757412	eng	Tom became very ill.
5757413	eng	It's getting to me.
5757415	eng	Tom beats people up.
5757417	eng	It's a great start.
5757418	eng	Tom beat those odds.
5757419	eng	It's a bit extreme.
5757422	eng	It was worse today.
5757423	eng	It was turned down.
5757424	eng	They agree with Tom.
5757425	eng	It was too intense.
5757426	eng	It was too extreme.
5757427	eng	Is that Tom's fault?
5757429	eng	It was so terrific.
5757430	eng	I'm praying for Tom.
5757431	eng	It was so terrible.
5757432	eng	It was so mystical.
5757434	eng	It was so horrible.
5757435	eng	It was so fabulous.
5757437	eng	It was rough today.
5757438	eng	It was pretty loud.
5757440	eng	It was pretty gory.
5757441	eng	It was poor timing.
5757442	eng	I fully support Tom.
5757443	eng	It was just stupid.
5757444	eng	It was just nerves.
5757451	eng	Does Tom make money?
5757453	eng	It makes you tough.
5757454	eng	Who speaks for Tom?
5757455	eng	It makes you proud.
5757456	eng	It makes us better.
5757457	eng	Who is Tom, anyway?
5757458	eng	It makes it easier.
5757460	eng	What does Tom know?
5757462	eng	It kept me engaged.
5757463	eng	We hardly know Tom.
5757464	eng	It isn't just that.
5757465	eng	It has all stopped.
5757467	eng	It has affected us.
5757468	eng	It feels real good.
5757469	eng	Tom will take over.
5757470	eng	It feels like home.
5757471	eng	It ended just fine.
5757472	eng	Tom will bat third.
5757473	eng	It could get tense.
5757474	eng	It could be deadly.
5757475	eng	Tom wasn't so sure.
5757476	eng	It could be better.
5757478	eng	Tom was very proud.
5757479	eng	It can be improved.
5757480	eng	It breaks my heart.
5757481	eng	Tom was thrown out.
5757482	eng	It boggles my mind.
5757483	eng	Is this too sloppy?
5757484	eng	Tom was pushing me.
5757485	eng	Is this too little?
5757486	eng	Is that too little?
5757487	eng	Tom was just great.
5757488	eng	Is that a definite?
5757491	eng	I've seen too much.
5757493	eng	Tom was all smiles.
5757495	eng	I'm thrilled to go.
5757496	eng	Tom was a crusader.
5757497	eng	I'm supposed to go.
5757499	eng	Tom stole the show.
5757501	eng	I'm not hoofing it.
5757502	eng	Tom smoked a cigar.
5757505	eng	Tom slowed the car.
5757506	eng	I'm in great shape.
5757507	eng	I'm going to vomit.
5757508	eng	Tom runs a charity.
5757509	eng	I'm going to relax.
5757510	eng	I'm going to fight.
5757513	eng	I'm fine with this.
5757515	eng	I'm fine with that.
5757516	eng	I'm feeling a buzz.
5757517	eng	Tom pays his taxes.
5757520	eng	Tom paid Mary cash.
5757521	eng	I'm buying a puppy.
5757522	eng	I'm back to normal.
5757523	eng	Tom messed up huge.
5757524	eng	I'm all for change.
5757525	eng	I'm alive and well.
5757526	eng	Tom made Mary jump.
5757527	eng	I'm a mature adult.
5757529	eng	Tom loves his golf.
5757531	eng	I'll leave you now.
5757532	eng	Tom loved to dance.
5757533	eng	I would've done it.
5757535	eng	Tom loved the work.

5757543	eng	I was so fortunate.
5757544	eng	Tom likes it there.
5757546	eng	I was proved wrong.
5757547	eng	Tom liked to laugh.
5757549	eng	I was in disbelief.
5757550	eng	Tom led by example.
5757553	eng	Tom knows the cost.
5757559	eng	Tom kissed my neck.
5757560	eng	I promise you that.
5757561	eng	I never sleep well.
5757562	eng	Tom just messed up.
5757563	eng	I never changed it.
5757564	eng	I need my paycheck.
5757565	eng	Tom isn't sure yet.
5757567	eng	I loved every bite.
5757568	eng	Tom isn't sure why.
5757569	eng	I love this device.
5757570	eng	I love red parrots.
5757572	eng	I love our chances.
5757574	eng	Tom isn't a slouch.
5757575	eng	I like this season.
5757576	eng	I like our chances.
5757577	eng	Tom is well rested.
5757579	eng	I just kept silent.
5757583	eng	Tom is still tough.
5757586	eng	Tom is staying put.
5757587	eng	I have the jitters.
5757588	eng	I hate most people.
5757589	eng	Tom is smoking hot.
5757590	eng	I had zero control.
5757592	eng	Tom is good enough.
5757593	eng	I get your message.
5757594	eng	I felt so violated.
5757596	eng	I felt so betrayed.
5757597	eng	I feel so uplifted.
5757598	eng	Tom is an explorer.
5757599	eng	I feel so confused.
5757600	eng	I dream about bugs.
5757602	eng	I don't want money.

5757604	eng	Tom is an agnostic.
5757605	eng	I don't smoke weed.
5757606	eng	I don't sell drugs.
5757607	eng	Tom is always good.
5757608	eng	I don't believe so.
5757609	eng	I do have concerns.
5757610	eng	Tom is always cool.
5757611	eng	I didn't play well.
5757612	eng	I didn't look back.
5757613	eng	Tom is almost here.
5757615	eng	I depend on nobody.
5757617	eng	I could name names.
5757618	eng	I can't walk alone.
5757619	eng	Tom is a screwball.
5757620	eng	I can't live there.
5757622	eng	Tom is a daredevil.
5757624	eng	I believe in peace.
5757626	eng	I became a recluse.
5757627	eng	I admitted as much.
5757629	eng	How will you fight?
5757630	eng	How unfair is that?
5757632	eng	How stupid is that?
5757633	eng	How lucky was that?
5757634	eng	Tom hired a driver.
5757635	eng	How does hail form?
5757636	eng	How did you manage?
5757637	eng	Tom hasn't yet won.
5757638	eng	How did tonight go?
5757639	eng	How can you retire?

5757693	eng	Enjoy your new car.
5757694	eng	Dressing up is fun.
5757695	eng	Tom had nice stuff.
5757696	eng	Don't you get that?
5757697	eng	Does anyone get it?
5757698	eng	Tom had had enough.
5757699	eng	Do what feels good.
5757700	eng	Do I look paranoid?
5757702	eng	Did you feel happy?
5757703	eng	Cut back on sweets.
5757704	eng	Tom got tired soon.
5757705	eng	Can you support me?
5757706	eng	Can they do better?
5757707	eng	Tom froze to death.
5757710	eng	Tom drove me crazy.
5757711	eng	Are you that dense?
5757712	eng	Are you all morons?
5757714	eng	Are we bad parents?
5757716	eng	Tom didn't look OK.
5757719	eng	Tom didn't get far.
5757721	eng	You have to adapt.
5757722	eng	Tom didn't do well.
5757723	eng	You can keep them.
5757725	eng	Tom did make money.
5757726	eng	Why did they meet?
5757727	eng	Who wants a treat?
5757728	eng	Tom could do worse.
5757729	eng	Who pays for what?
5757731	eng	Tom could be armed.
5757733	eng	What's it all for?
5757734	eng	Tom chose to fight.
5757736	eng	What song is this?
5757737	eng	Tom changed it all.
5757738	eng	What show is this?
5757739	eng	What am I getting?
5757740	eng	Tom caught a thief.

5757752	eng	Tom broke the lamp.
5757753	eng	We spent too much.
5757754	eng	We slugged it out.
5757755	eng	Tom broke his word.
5757757	eng	We saw that today.
5757758	eng	Tom also showed up.
5757760	eng	We need new blood.
5757761	eng	So, who killed Tom?
5757762	eng	We need a bailout.
5757765	eng	We knew that much.
5757766	eng	We just proved it.
5757767	eng	People call me Tom.
5757768	eng	We hope it'll end.
5757770	eng	I'm voting for Tom.
5757771	eng	We got to talking.
5757772	eng	We get along fine.
5757773	eng	I should visit Tom.
5757774	eng	We follow the law.
5757775	eng	We drove them out.
5757776	eng	I like Tom's style.
5757777	eng	We can't fail now.
5757778	eng	We can stay quiet.
5757780	eng	We are very close.
5757781	eng	We all think that.
5757783	eng	We all read books.
5757784	eng	We all love lists.
5757785	eng	What does Tom say?
5757786	eng	We all grow wiser.

5757802	eng	The money is good.
5757803	eng	Tom was so strong.
5757804	eng	The good guys won.
5757805	eng	The game was over.
5757806	eng	Tom was so scared.
5757807	eng	The end is coming.
5757808	eng	The cost was huge.
5757809	eng	Tom was so polite.
5757810	eng	The cars sped off.
5757812	eng	Tom was so loving.
5757814	eng	That was too late.
5757815	eng	Tom was so hungry.
5757817	eng	That song was fun.
5757819	eng	That makes my day.
5757820	eng	That helps us out.
5757821	eng	Tom was fast, too.
5757822	eng	That gives me joy.
5757824	eng	Tom was behind me.
5757825	eng	Stay on your toes.
5757826	eng	So, why change it?
5757827	eng	Tom was a witness.
5757828	eng	Shut up and drive.
5757829	eng	Show us the proof.
5757830	eng	Tom was a gambler.
5757839	eng	Tom tries so hard.
5757840	eng	Now let's move on.
5757841	eng	My kids love dogs.

5757852	eng	Keep your head up.
5757853	eng	Keep a civil tone.
5757856	eng	It's not about us.
5757858	eng	It's my lucky day.
5757860	eng	Tom ratted us out.
5757861	eng	It's ideal for us.
5757863	eng	Tom ratted me out.
5757864	eng	It's all good fun.
5757865	eng	It's a tough call.
5757866	eng	Tom ran into debt.
5757868	eng	It was very tense.
5757869	eng	Tom needs a tutor.
5757870	eng	It was so chaotic.
5757871	eng	It was fun anyway.
5757872	eng	Tom must go there.
5757875	eng	Tom might be good.
5757879	eng	It seems that way.
5757880	eng	It ruined my life.
5757882	eng	It may be working.
5757883	eng	It makes me proud.
5757884	eng	Tom lost the game.
5757885	eng	It helps a little.
5757886	eng	It doesn't add up.
5757887	eng	Tom lost all hope.
5757888	eng	It does take time.
5757891	eng	It broke my heart.
5757892	eng	It ain't over yet.
5757893	eng	Tom leapt for joy.
5757894	eng	Is your bank safe?
5757895	eng	Is there a heaven?

5757917	eng	Tom is a linguist.
5757918	eng	I'd love to coach.

5757942	eng	I started in 2013.
5757943	eng	I should be fired.
5757945	eng	I sense a victory.
5757946	eng	I saw some bodies.

5758041	eng	Tom was so funny.
5758042	eng	Why did we leave?
5758043	eng	Why all the fuss?
5758044	eng	Tom was so awful.

5758046	eng	When did we meet?
5758049	eng	What might it be?
5758050	eng	Tom was out cold.
5758051	eng	What makes it go?

5758084	eng	We aren't so bad.
5758085	eng	This we all know.
5758087	eng	This might be so.
5758088	eng	This made me sad.
5758089	eng	Tom rode a camel.
5758090	eng	This is our park.
5758094	eng	They were a team.
5758097	eng	They got us good.
5758102	eng	The jury is back.
5758103	eng	The hunt is over.

5758154	eng	Is today the day?
5758155	eng	Tom is a natural.
5758156	eng	Is this not true?
5758157	eng	Is there no hope?
5758158	eng	Tom is a hustler.
5758159	eng	Is that too many?
5758160	eng	Is that my rifle?
5758161	eng	Tom is a glutton.

5758163	eng	I've had a blast.
5758164	eng	Tom hit the mark.
5758166	eng	I'm not an actor.
5758170	eng	Tom heard a thud.
5758174	eng	I'm a lot better.
5758176	eng	Tom had it wrong.
5758178	eng	I worry about it.

5758193	eng	I should hope so.
5758194	eng	Tom got me wrong.
5758197	eng	Tom gets my vote.
5758198	eng	I prayed for you.

5758200	eng	Tom fled on foot.
5758201	eng	I needed to vent.
5758202	eng	I need some maps.
5758204	eng	I might throw up.
5758205	eng	I listen to them.

5758225	eng	How true is this?
5758226	eng	How true is that?
5758227	eng	Tom cracks me up.
5758228	eng	How safe is safe?
5758229	eng	How easy is this?
5758230	eng	Tom can't be ill.
5758231	eng	How easy is that?
5758232	eng	How do we manage?
5758234	eng	How do they cope?
5758238	eng	Good luck to you.
5758239	eng	Tom came at once.
5758240	eng	Get to know them.
5758241	eng	Get off the road.
5758243	eng	Do you regret it?
5758250	eng	Can we be honest?
5758251	eng	I made Tom happy.
5758253	eng	Are you my mommy?
5758254	eng	Give Tom his due.
5758257	eng	Did Tom ever win?
5758259	eng	You may be next.
5758267	eng	What do you bid?
5758268	eng	What did I know?

5758325	eng	It was very odd.
5758327	eng	It was very far.
5758328	eng	It was very big.
5758331	eng	It was very bad.

5758370	eng	We get on well.
5758371	eng	Was I too loud?
5758376	eng	That may be so.
5758381	eng	I never saw Tom.
5758382	eng	OK, I'll do it.
5758384	eng	My son is gone.
5758388	eng	I pay my taxes.

5760005	eng	Mary was from Eriskay.
5760150	eng	Tom stared in disbelief.
5760184	eng	How difficult is that?
5760242	eng	Where does Tom study?
5760320	eng	Is this a fraction?
5760321	eng	Is this an integer?
5760331	eng	That's my favorite expression.
5760354	eng	The house seemed empty.
5760870	eng	You don't eat bananas?
5762623	eng	Is someone calling me?
5762628	eng	That isn't Tom's suitcase.
5762738	eng	When are we leaving?
5762740	eng	When will we leave?
5763873	eng	Some employees like change.
5763878	eng	Who's the last one?
5764917	eng	This is a window.
5764920	eng	This is a cup.
5765216	eng	That isn't Tom's trombone.
5765219	eng	Let yourself be happy.
5765223	eng	Life isn't always fun.
5765435	eng	Life still isn't easy.
5765539	eng	Hasn't Tom seen her?
5766676	eng	They signed a confession.

5767538	eng	Please don't blame me.
5767542	eng	That just isn't right.
5767547	eng	That just seems wrong.
5767610	eng	It's a self-fulfilling prophecy.
5767613	eng	Tom's parents freaked out.
5767627	eng	Tom touched Mary's shoulder.
5767640	eng	Tsunamis are very rare.
5767656	eng	Never buy extended warranties.
5767693	eng	Hurry up, will you?
5767736	eng	This isn't good news.
5767924	eng	Tom should've known this.
5768333	eng	I won't drink anything.
5768339	eng	Tom won't be tired.
5768971	eng	I got ripped off.

5769465	eng	That's a touchy issue.
5769585	eng	It's really, really strange.
5769617	eng	Her mother was aghast.
5769618	eng	Tom's mother was aghast.
5769648	eng	Being rejected is painful.

5771967	eng	What's this city like?
5772033	eng	Tom thinks it's me.
5772056	eng	Turn off your cellphone.
5772071	eng	Tom stretched his legs.
5772073	eng	Mary stretched her legs.
5772148	eng	That's quite a luxury.
5773685	eng	Nobody will believe you.
5773918	eng	I liked this game.
5774059	eng	That's very, very sad.
5774063	eng	The game has finished.
5774095	eng	Mosquitos don't respect walls.
5774124	eng	The gun wasn't loaded.
5774132	eng	The world is changing.

5774508	eng	Were you really angry?
5774512	eng	What's in your wallet?
5774834	eng	Where are your gloves?
5774855	eng	The moon is beautiful.
5774941	eng	You can't beat everyone.
5776151	eng	Eggs are very fragile.
5776204	eng	Add the vanilla extract.
5776333	eng	Love has blinded you.
5776393	eng	He kissed her fingers.
5776510	eng	Her lips were warm.
5776511	eng	His lips were warm.
5776572	eng	You might get injured.
5776576	eng	You sound so childish.

7118035	eng	It's a different situation.
7118037	eng	It's been very interesting.
7118047	eng	That never happened before.
7118054	eng	Tom started a fire.
7118067	eng	I'm definitely against that.
7118070	eng	Tom has broken even.
7118075	eng	That's all that's important.
7118076	eng	Hopefully, Tom knows that.
7118092	eng	Is Tom officially retired?
7118095	eng	It was definitely surprising.
7118096	eng	Obviously, Tom has talent.
7118102	eng	Tom might be crying.
7118110	eng	Tom apologized to us.
7118124	eng	Eventually Tom fell asleep.
7118125	eng	Obviously, that didn't happen.
7118128	eng	Has Tom officially retired?
7118134	eng	Tom decided to escape.

7119551	eng	I use many things.
7119555	eng	I used many things.
7119570	eng	Don't fear the love.
7120196	eng	The news is on.
7120199	eng	Tom is a cannibal.
7120205	eng	This could be true.
7120206	eng	The sky became dark.
7120214	eng	That's quite true, Tom.
7120218	eng	The guards grabbed Tom.
7120219	eng	The room is spinning.
7120221	eng	The rumor seems true.
7120231	eng	The boys came running.
7120233	eng	They wouldn't help us.
7120235	eng	Three guests may come.
7120237	eng	That's the big problem.
7120239	eng	That's the bottom line.
7120241	eng	They'd better be right.
7120253	eng	They're doing their job.
7120259	eng	The other boys snickered.
7120263	eng	There's a big difference.
7120267	eng	They should be respected.
7120273	eng	Things have quieted down.
7120275	eng	This conflict isn't over.
7120276	eng	This is Tom's responsibility.
7120295	eng	That's our biggest problem.
7120301	eng	The rumor isn't groundless.
7120319	eng	There are ghosts everywhere.
7120323	eng	These accusations are false.
7120325	eng	This obviously concerns you.
7120353	eng	These kids are self-motivated.
7120363	eng	This is certainly interesting.
7120385	eng	These accidents keep happening.
7120393	eng	The performance was outstanding.
7120636	eng	Those things happen sometimes.
7120639	eng	Tom must've gone crazy.
7120640	eng	We've achieved our objectives.
7120663	eng	Tom will speak tonight.
7120681	eng	There were other possibilities.
7120699	eng	Obviously, Tom is talented.
7120706	eng	It's personally very satisfying.
7120727	eng	Where's the closest supermarket?
7121004	eng	You're my hero, Sami.
7121035	eng	Sami owns this house.
7121070	eng	Are you Sami's daughter?
7121088	eng	Sami had Layla's phone.
7121092	eng	This phone is Sami's.
7121101	eng	Where is Sami's dad?
7121120	eng	When is Sami's birthday?
7121191	eng	Sami's face was covered.
7121195	eng	Sami recognized the gun.
7121215	eng	Sami reported the theft.
7121589	eng	Tom stalled the engine.
7122447	eng	You're my idol, Sami.
7122450	eng	You're my champion, Sami.
7122464	eng	You're my star, Sami.
7122687	eng	Fuck if I know.
7122744	eng	Tom's face haunts me.
7122964	eng	Show Tom who's boss.
7122966	eng	Stop gawking at Tom.
7122968	eng	Shut your mouth, Tom.
7122969	eng	Shall we do that?
7122970	eng	Singing is Tom's thing.
7122975	eng	Show me your work.
7122977	eng	Suppose I do that.
7122981	eng	Sea water is salty.
7122987	eng	That isn't the issue.
7123005	eng	Should we speak French?
7123008	eng	Tom seemed genuinely confused.
7123010	eng	Tom seemed genuinely relieved.
7123015	eng	That's a hard decision.
7123019	eng	That's an outright lie.
7123024	eng	Tom should've been displeased.
7123025	eng	People really like that.
7123026	eng	Tom should've been supportive.
7123031	eng	Someone's spying on you.
7123035	eng	That's a big difference.
7123047	eng	That should be forbidden.
7123049	eng	That's always been there.
7123057	eng	Please don't sing anymore.
7123067	eng	That seemed simple enough.
7123071	eng	That wouldn't convince me.
7123083	eng	Should voting be mandatory?
7123090	eng	Tom's application was refused.
7123091	eng	That's breaking new ground.
7123096	eng	Tom's health has deteriorated.
7123098	eng	Tom's perspective has changed.
7123103	eng	That's a legitimate concern.
7123200	eng	Tom entered without hesitation.
7123503	eng	Everything feels different today.
7123514	eng	Tom is being manipulated.
7123546	eng	Tom should've left early.
7123554	eng	Tom shouldn't be outside.
7123571	eng	Unfortunately, things have changed.
7123604	eng	Perhaps Tom should've stayed.

7123751	eng	Tom is a multimillionaire.
7123765	eng	There are flamingos everywhere!
7123859	eng	Tom is a footslogger.
7124009	eng	Tom is being investigated.
7125541	eng	Time is flying by.
7125920	eng	I'm not risking anything.
7125924	eng	Where's the shoe department?
7125955	eng	That's something I'll cherish.
7125963	eng	That's not Tom's style.
7125964	eng	That isn't Tom's style.
7125976	eng	Thankfully, no one noticed.
7125983	eng	Not everyone hugged Tom.

7126155	eng	May I get ready?
7126156	eng	My eyes met Tom's.
7126159	eng	How are you coping?
7126160	eng	Is Tom coming along?
7126164	eng	Isn't Tom angry yet?
7126167	eng	How does memory work?
7126168	eng	It serves Tom right.
7126175	eng	How generous is that?
7126176	eng	Just keep going, Tom.
7126179	eng	Let's have Tom leave.
7126182	eng	How safe are opioids?
7126184	eng	My mouth went dry.
7126187	eng	Nothing can stop Tom.
7126190	eng	How's life going now?
7126191	eng	Offer Tom some money.
7126192	eng	Let's just do that.
7126196	eng	My car caught fire.
7126200	eng	My car was totaled.
7126206	eng	How about a compromise?
7126208	eng	It doesn't end well.
7126211	eng	Music is Tom's passion.
7126223	eng	It's making Tom nervous.
7126236	eng	My vacation is over.
7126240	eng	My worries are over.
7126244	eng	How fortunate we are.
7126248	eng	It wasn't a question.
7126259	eng	Legally, Tom isn't guilty.
7126274	eng	Is there sufficient light?
7126280	eng	Life has become easy.
7126282	eng	Is this financial suicide?
7126288	eng	My mind's gone blank.
7126296	eng	It keeps me motivated.
7126304	eng	It's just a meteorite.
7126316	eng	Let's order out today.
7126318	eng	How are rates determined?
7126332	eng	My request was denied.
7126383	eng	Money's a little tight.

7126395	eng	My trial started today.
7126477	eng	How safe are e-cigarettes?
7126495	eng	My trial starts tomorrow.
7126515	eng	It was really frustrating.
7126539	eng	It's already been checked.
7126554	eng	Technically, Tom poisoned himself.
7126569	eng	Isn't that something different?
7126571	eng	My heart started pounding.
7126589	eng	How are you psychologically?
7126596	eng	Tom takes everything seriously.
7126607	eng	It wasn't anything special.
7126627	eng	It's something very unique.
7126659	eng	My answer stunned everyone.
7126708	eng	Tom wasn't very self-conscious.
7126778	eng	It's certainly a distraction.
7126804	eng	My eyesight is deteriorating.
7126852	eng	It's completely beyond repair.
7126861	eng	Tom's comments were misleading.
7127171	eng	Initially, everything seemed difficult.
7127255	eng	Tom started crying hysterically.
7127334	eng	Tom's happiness was short-lived.
7127338	eng	Tom's proposals weren't adopted.
7127390	eng	Tom could've been self-conscious.
7127690	eng	Tom understands what's necessary.
7127726	eng	Tom's excitement was short-lived.

7127942	eng	We both want them.
7127943	eng	We need to negotiate.
7127944	eng	Let's play this game.
7127945	eng	That's what bartering means.
7127958	eng	Where are the fish?
7127959	eng	We found the fish.
7127964	eng	Hand me the shovel.

7132176	eng	Bring me some wine.
7132177	eng	Are you like Tom?
7132178	eng	Aren't you at work?
7132179	eng	Tom agreed to testify.
7132182	eng	Don't you do that?
7132184	eng	Do that, will you?
7132186	eng	Give me some tea.
7132188	eng	Can you go alone?
7132190	eng	Can I touch this?
