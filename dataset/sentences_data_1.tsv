2250092	eng	That can happen.
2250093	eng	That can wait.
2250094	eng	That can't happen.
2250095	eng	That changed everything.
2250096	eng	That changes everything.
2250097	eng	That could happen.
2250098	eng	That could help.
2250099	eng	That could work.
2250100	eng	That couldn't be.
2250101	eng	That didn't happen.
2250102	eng	That didn't hurt.
2250103	eng	That does it.
2250104	eng	That doesn't count.
2250105	eng	That doesn't happen.
2250106	eng	That doesn't help.
2250107	eng	That doesn't work.
2250108	eng	That feels better.
2250109	eng	That feels good.
2250110	eng	That feels wonderful.
2250111	eng	That felt good.
2250112	eng	That isn't funny.
2250113	eng	That isn't good.
2250114	eng	That isn't it.
2250115	eng	That isn't much.
2250116	eng	That isn't necessary.
2250117	eng	That isn't possible.
2250118	eng	That isn't real.
2250119	eng	That isn't right.
2250120	eng	That isn't true.
2250121	eng	That job's finished.
2250122	eng	That just happened.
2250123	eng	That looks bad.
2250124	eng	That looks expensive.
2250125	eng	That looks familiar.
2250126	eng	That looks painful.
2250127	eng	That looks stupid.
2250128	eng	That may work.
2250129	eng	That never changes.
2250130	eng	That never happened.
2250131	eng	That never happens.
2250132	eng	That never worked.
2250133	eng	That really happened.
2250134	eng	That really hurts.
2250135	eng	That seems fair.
2250136	eng	That seems impossible.
2250137	eng	That seems odd.
2250138	eng	That seems right.
2250139	eng	That seems understandable.
2250140	eng	That seems unlikely.
2250141	eng	That seems weird.
2250142	eng	That seems wrong.
2250143	eng	That settles it.
2250144	eng	That settles that.
2250145	eng	That should help.
2250240	eng	Don't distract me.
2250241	eng	Don't get emotional.
2250242	eng	Don't sing along.
2250243	eng	His name's Tom.
2250244	eng	I considered Tom.
2250246	eng	I framed Tom.
2250247	eng	I'll phone Tom.
2250249	eng	I've contacted Tom.
2250250	eng	I've located Tom.
2250251	eng	Tom won't negotiate.
2250451	eng	May I eat?
2250503	eng	I got sunburned.
2250907	eng	That should suffice.
2250908	eng	That sounded good.
2250909	eng	That sounded weird.

2250924	eng	That sounds promising.
2250925	eng	That sounds right.
2250926	eng	That sounds serious.
2250927	eng	That sounds stupid.
2250928	eng	That sounds terrible.
2250929	eng	That sounds urgent.
2250930	eng	That sounds wonderful.
2250931	eng	That surprises me.
2250932	eng	That was abrupt.
2250933	eng	That was beautiful.
2250934	eng	That was brilliant.
2250935	eng	That was considerate.
2250936	eng	That was cool.
2250937	eng	That was crazy.
2250938	eng	That was delicious.

2250940	eng	That was excellent.
2250941	eng	That was exciting.
2250942	eng	That was fantastic.
2250943	eng	That was foolish.
2250944	eng	That was freaky.
2250945	eng	That was free.
2250946	eng	That was funny.
2250947	eng	That was harsh.
2250948	eng	That was helpful.
2250949	eng	That was hot.
2250950	eng	That was hysterical.
2250951	eng	That was impressive.
2250952	eng	That was inappropriate.
2250953	eng	That was incredible.
2250954	eng	That was interesting.
2250955	eng	That was it.
2250956	eng	That was legitimate.
2250957	eng	That was loud.
2250958	eng	That was lovely.
2250959	eng	That was magic.
2250960	eng	That was me.
2250961	eng	That was mine.
2250962	eng	That was nice.
2250963	eng	That was nifty.
2250964	eng	That was obvious.
2250965	eng	That was odd.
2250966	eng	That was pathetic.
2250967	eng	That was perfect.
2250968	eng	That was personal.
2250969	eng	That was pitiful.
2250970	eng	That was quick.
2250971	eng	That was rejected.
2250972	eng	That was risky.
2250973	eng	That was sensible.
2250974	eng	That was serious.
2250975	eng	That was smart.
2250976	eng	That was strange.
2250977	eng	That was sweet.
2250978	eng	That was terrible.
2250979	eng	That was terrific.
2250980	eng	That was unbelievable.
2250981	eng	That was uncool.
2250982	eng	That was unfair.
2250983	eng	That was unforgivable.
2250984	eng	That was unfortunate.
2250985	eng	That was unnecessary.
2250986	eng	That was unpleasant.
2250987	eng	That was weird.
2250988	eng	That was wonderful.
2250989	eng	That was wrong.
2250990	eng	That was yours.
2250991	eng	That wasn't bad.
2250992	eng	That wasn't cool.
2250993	eng	That wasn't hard.
2250994	eng	That wasn't it.
2250995	eng	That wasn't me.
2250996	eng	That wasn't necessary.
2250997	eng	That wasn't nice.
2250998	eng	That wasn't real.
2250999	eng	That wasn't right.
2251000	eng	That wasn't smart.
2251001	eng	That went fast.
2251002	eng	That went smoothly.
2251003	eng	That went well.
2251004	eng	That will help.
2251005	eng	That will pass.
2251006	eng	That won't change.
2251007	eng	That won't help.
2251008	eng	That worked well.
2251009	eng	That worries me.
2251010	eng	That would fit.
2251011	eng	That would follow.
2251012	eng	That would help.
2251013	eng	That would work.
2251014	eng	That would've hurt.
2251015	eng	That wouldn't help.
2251016	eng	That'll be all.
2251017	eng	That'll be fine.
2251018	eng	That'll be fun.
2251019	eng	That'll be great.
2251020	eng	That'll be hard.
2251021	eng	That'll be helpful.
2251022	eng	That'll be interesting.
2251023	eng	That'll be nice.
2251024	eng	That'll be tough.
2251025	eng	That'll be wonderful.
2251026	eng	That'll do it.
2251027	eng	That'll do nicely.
2251028	eng	That'll never happen.
2251029	eng	That'll never work.
2251030	eng	That'll show them.
2251031	eng	That'll stop them.
2251032	eng	That'll take time.
2251033	eng	That'll work fine.
2251034	eng	That'll work well.
2251035	eng	That's a bummer.
2251036	eng	That's a change.
2251037	eng	That's a coincidence.
2251038	eng	That's a crime.
2251039	eng	That's a felony.
2251040	eng	That's a gimmick.
2251041	eng	That's a mistake.
2251042	eng	That's a pity.
2251043	eng	That's a possibility.
2251044	eng	That's a risk.
2251045	eng	That's a surprise.
2251046	eng	That's a tragedy.
2251047	eng	That's about all.
2251048	eng	That's about right.
2251049	eng	That's absolutely incredible.
2251050	eng	That's absolutely unacceptable.
2251051	eng	That's all wrong.
2251052	eng	That's always fun.
2251053	eng	That's an idea.
2251054	eng	That's an improvement.
2251055	eng	That's an inspiration.
2251056	eng	That's an outrage.
2251057	eng	That's an understatement.
2251058	eng	That's another thing.
2251059	eng	That's certainly possible.
2251060	eng	That's classified information.
2251061	eng	That's close enough.
2251062	eng	That's completely inaccurate.
2251063	eng	That's downright dangerous.
2251064	eng	That's encouraging news.
2251065	eng	That's exactly right.
2251066	eng	That's excellent news.
2251067	eng	That's exciting news.
2251068	eng	That's extremely surprising.
2251069	eng	That's fantastic news.
2251070	eng	That's funny stuff.
2251071	eng	That's good coffee.
2251072	eng	That's good enough.
2251073	eng	That's good news.
2251074	eng	That's good stuff.
2251075	eng	That's great news.
2251076	eng	That's hardly likely.
2251077	eng	That's highly unlikely.
2251078	eng	That's just bizarre.
2251079	eng	That's just fine.
2251080	eng	That's just great.
2251081	eng	That's just impossible.
2251082	eng	That's just mean.
2251083	eng	That's just nonsense.
2251084	eng	That's just sick.
2251085	eng	That's just stupid.
2251086	eng	That's just weird.
2251087	eng	That's just wrong.
2251088	eng	That's much better.
2251089	eng	That's my answer.
2251090	eng	That's my beer.
2251091	eng	That's my bike.
2251092	eng	That's my brother.
2251093	eng	That's my business.
2251094	eng	That's my car.
2251095	eng	That's my favorite.
2251096	eng	That's my hope.
2251097	eng	That's my lunch.
2251098	eng	That's my medicine.
2251099	eng	That's my point.
2251100	eng	That's my signature.
2251101	eng	That's my sister.
2251102	eng	That's my son.
2251103	eng	That's my specialty.
2251104	eng	That's my stuff.
2251105	eng	That's my theory.
2251106	eng	That's my toothbrush.
2251141	eng	That's my umbrella.
2251142	eng	That's my understanding.
2251143	eng	That's no problem.
2251144	eng	That's no secret.
2251145	eng	That's not advisable.
2251146	eng	That's not allowed.
2251147	eng	That's not appropriate.
2251148	eng	That's not believable.
2251149	eng	That's not cheap.
2251150	eng	That's not clear.
2251151	eng	That's not difficult.
2251152	eng	That's not easy.
2251154	eng	That's not healthy.
2251155	eng	That's not helpful.
2251156	eng	That's not helping.
2251157	eng	That's not important.
2251158	eng	That's not necessary.
2251159	eng	That's not normal.
2251160	eng	That's not OK.
2251161	eng	That's not practical.
2251162	eng	That's not rational.
2251163	eng	That's not relevant.
2251164	eng	That's not right.
2251165	eng	That's not so.
2251166	eng	That's not surprising.
2251167	eng	That's not uncommon.
2251168	eng	That's not unusual.
2251169	eng	That's not why.
2251170	eng	That's not wrong.
2251171	eng	That's not yours.
2251172	eng	That's nothing new.
2251173	eng	That's old news.
2251174	eng	That's one explanation.
2251175	eng	That's one interpretation.
2251176	eng	That's one option.
2251177	eng	That's one possibility.
2251178	eng	That's one reason.
2251179	eng	That's only fair.
2251180	eng	That's only natural.
2251181	eng	That's our business.
2251182	eng	That's our job.
2251183	eng	That's our policy.
2251184	eng	That's our priority.
2251185	eng	That's our problem.
2251186	eng	That's our secret.
2251187	eng	That's our train.
2251188	eng	That's partially correct.
2251189	eng	That's perfectly fair.
2251190	eng	That's perfectly legal.
2251191	eng	That's perfectly natural.
2251192	eng	That's perfectly normal.
2251193	eng	That's perfectly understandable.
2251194	eng	That's pretty bad.
2251195	eng	That's pretty close.
2251196	eng	That's pretty cool.
2251197	eng	That's pretty funny.
2251198	eng	That's pretty good.
2251199	eng	That's pretty hot.
2251200	eng	That's pretty lame.
2251201	eng	That's pretty neat.
2251202	eng	That's pretty nice.
2251203	eng	That's pretty optimistic.
2251204	eng	That's pretty serious.
2251205	eng	That's pretty strange.
2251206	eng	That's pretty surprising.
2251207	eng	That's probably plenty.
2251208	eng	That's probably safer.
2251209	eng	That's probably true.
2251210	eng	That's probably why.
2251211	eng	That's probably wise.
2251212	eng	That's pure speculation.
2251213	eng	That's quite common.
2251214	eng	That's quite enough.
2251215	eng	That's quite helpful.
2251216	eng	That's quite intriguing.
2251217	eng	That's quite logical.
2251218	eng	That's quite new.
2251219	eng	That's quite obvious.
2251220	eng	That's quite powerful.
2251221	eng	That's quite remarkable.
2251222	eng	That's quite understandable.
2251223	eng	That's real helpful.
2251224	eng	That's real nice.
2251225	eng	That's real progress.
2251226	eng	That's really close.
2251227	eng	That's really cool.
2251228	eng	That's really dangerous.
2251229	eng	That's really distressing.
2251230	eng	That's really funny.
2251231	eng	That's really good.
2251232	eng	That's really great.
2251233	eng	That's really hot.

3719583	eng	What about dessert?
3721309	eng	That's your idea.
3721365	eng	It's too public.
3721375	eng	That's very dramatic.
3721382	eng	It'd be bad.
3721413	eng	I've called ahead.
3721441	eng	Tom felt snubbed.
3721452	eng	Tom was dumbfounded.
3721453	eng	You're completely surrounded.
3721456	eng	They all applauded.
3721457	eng	Tips aren't included.
3721461	eng	Tom didn't succeed.
3721478	eng	Tom wasn't discouraged.
3721481	eng	Tom casually shrugged.
3721486	eng	Blows were exchanged.
3721488	eng	Tom's arms ached.
3721491	eng	Tom never laughed.
3721492	eng	The girls laughed.
3721509	eng	Well, I lied.
3721519	eng	The clock ticked.
3721524	eng	Tom also talked.
3721539	eng	Tom's face paled.
3721544	eng	Tom was baffled.
3721548	eng	Tom seldom smiled.
3721549	eng	Tom also smiled.
3721550	eng	Tom's eyes twinkled.
3721551	eng	Tom's eyes sparkled.
3721565	eng	It's been dismantled.
3721566	eng	Tom was disgruntled.
3721574	eng	You're all doomed.
3721576	eng	Tom was alarmed.
3721608	eng	Tom's eyes softened.
3721609	eng	I'm so frightened.
3721612	eng	Tom quietly listened.
3721616	eng	I should've declined.
3721618	eng	Tom was ruined.
3721621	eng	Tom was mentioned.
3721623	eng	You've been forewarned.
3721634	eng	The mist cleared.
3721641	eng	Tom's attention wandered.
3721650	eng	It's been delivered.
3721661	eng	I'm so bored.
3721664	eng	Tom seemed reassured.
3721665	eng	Tom felt reassured.
3721670	eng	Tom wasn't displeased.
3721680	eng	Tom isn't licensed.
3721689	eng	I'm so depressed.
3721694	eng	Tom looks distressed.
3721697	eng	Tom became confused.
3721707	eng	Tom was irritated.
3721721	eng	Tom was delighted.
3721725	eng	They were discontented.
3721735	eng	You're so kind-hearted.
3721743	eng	I'm so wasted.
3721769	eng	The static continued.
3721779	eng	Tom could've survived.
3721791	eng	You never showed.
3721795	eng	Tom was overjoyed.
3721797	eng	It's been destroyed.
3721802	eng	I'm so afraid.
3721830	eng	That's unbelievably stupid.
3721838	eng	I'm so cold.
3721839	eng	Brr, it's cold.
3721935	eng	I glanced around.
3721942	eng	Quit screwing around.
3721962	eng	It'd be good.
3721963	eng	That'd be good.
3721967	eng	It'd look good.
3722022	eng	I leaned forward.
3722026	eng	It feels weird.
3722046	eng	Tom laughed aloud.
3722047	eng	Tom chuckled aloud.
3722049	eng	I'm so proud.
3722108	eng	That'd be nice.
3722112	eng	It felt nice.
3722234	eng	You better hide.
3722263	eng	I heartily agree.
3722290	eng	They were safe.
3722371	eng	That'll never change.
3722375	eng	It feels strange.
3722408	eng	That's no lie.
3722455	eng	That is unavoidable.
3722460	eng	Tom seems approachable.
3722461	eng	It was unthinkable.
3722484	eng	That's very hospitable.
3722498	eng	Tom was responsible.
3722509	eng	It'd be impossible.
3722510	eng	That'd be impossible.
3722514	eng	Tom was irresistible.
3722581	eng	We're reasonable people.
3722624	eng	It bothered me.
3722674	eng	Stop protecting me.
3722676	eng	Stop tormenting me.
3722798	eng	Tom intrigues me.
3722822	eng	You've lost me.
3722887	eng	It's quitting time.
3722926	eng	You better come.
3722956	eng	That'd be fine.
3722973	eng	The pleasure's mine.
3722974	eng	I've got mine.
3722976	eng	I'm under quarantine.
3723033	eng	They were gone.
3723050	eng	I'm so alone.
3723161	eng	I'm waiting here.
3723188	eng	I'm up here.
3723350	eng	Tom was insecure.
3723384	eng	Tom feigned surprise.
3723409	eng	It'd make sense.
3723417	eng	That'd make sense.
3723433	eng	It's coming loose.
3723477	eng	They stayed late.
3723496	eng	I grew desperate.
3723497	eng	Tom isn't illiterate.
3723517	eng	You're incredibly cute.
3723528	eng	There's no substitute.
3723585	eng	Tom's resume's impressive.
3723587	eng	Tom's very effusive.
3723641	eng	Tom stormed off.
3723642	eng	They shoved off.
3723662	eng	That's your half.
3723663	eng	Tom braced himself.
3723665	eng	Tom helped himself.
3723666	eng	Tom cursed himself.
3723667	eng	Tom hated himself.
3723698	eng	Please cover yourself.
3723729	eng	Tom was aloof.
3723736	eng	Shake a leg.
3723767	eng	Tom began laughing.
3723807	eng	You are something.
3723839	eng	Tom denied nothing.
3723841	eng	Tom heard nothing.
3723846	eng	Tom ate nothing.
3723880	eng	Tom noticed everything.
3723895	eng	You're my everything.
3723963	eng	It's still functioning.
3724037	eng	Tom was waiting.
3724038	eng	Tom sat waiting.
3724052	eng	Well, that's upsetting.
3724055	eng	They were arguing.
3724068	eng	Tom began praying.
3724076	eng	It's very gratifying.
3724088	eng	That'd be amazing.
3724112	eng	It's dead wrong.
3724123	eng	It feels wrong.
3724161	eng	There's another hitch.
3724188	eng	I've suffered enough.
3724193	eng	That's long enough.
3724194	eng	I'm well enough.
3724330	eng	Tom smiled back.
3724331	eng	Tom stepped back.
3724363	eng	I'll double check.
3724367	eng	It's a gimmick.
3724383	eng	Circle the block.
3724412	eng	They couldn't talk.
3724444	eng	They were drunk.
3724445	eng	I'm so drunk.
3724493	eng	It'd better work.
3724506	eng	It can't work.
3724540	eng	It's completely illogical.
3724563	eng	It'd be illegal.
3724602	eng	Take the wheel.
3724636	eng	That's Tom's call.
3724725	eng	I'm so grateful.
3724726	eng	Tom was grateful.
3724727	eng	They were ungrateful.
3724731	eng	God, you're beautiful.
3724732	eng	Black is beautiful.
3724733	eng	It's astonishingly beautiful.
3724765	eng	Tom believed them.
3724798	eng	You've got rhythm.
3724878	eng	Stop sniveling, Tom.
3725130	eng	You'll spook Tom.
3725388	eng	They were firm.
3725408	eng	You're the historian.
3725411	eng	It's a plan.
3725446	eng	You're sadly mistaken.
3725537	eng	Tom nodded again.
3725538	eng	Tom whistled again.
3725539	eng	Tom screamed again.
3725541	eng	Tom sneezed again.
3725545	eng	Tom spoke again.
3725608	eng	They were thin.
3725619	eng	You better win.
3725703	eng	Take evasive action.
3725763	eng	It's barely noon.
3725793	eng	It'd be treason.
3725847	eng	Tom feigned concern.
3725873	eng	You better run.
3725995	eng	That'll never do.
3726024	eng	We better go.
3726025	eng	You better go.
3726051	eng	Tom smiled hello.
3726059	eng	Tom laughed, too.
3726101	eng	That's a wrap.
3726111	eng	You better sleep.
3726148	eng	It doesn't help.
3726165	eng	I'm washed up.
3726227	eng	Tom got up.
3726258	eng	Collect your gear.
3726316	eng	It's getting harder.
3726331	eng	It'd be murder.
3726340	eng	It's getting louder.
3726350	eng	You're the engineer.
3726449	eng	There's great danger.
3726464	eng	It's getting stronger.
3726524	eng	I can't bother.
3726604	eng	You're the writer.
3726618	eng	You've looked better.
3726658	eng	You're the driver.
3726672	eng	Keep under cover.
3726717	eng	Tom didn't stir.
3726776	eng	Blame your predecessor.
3726898	eng	They were cowards.
3726936	eng	I need supplies.
3726955	eng	I'm waiting tables.
3726971	eng	Quit playing games.
3727111	eng	It's like this.
3727142	eng	I'm watching this.
3727148	eng	I'm using this.
3727366	eng	They were cousins.
3727370	eng	I've severed communications.
3727403	eng	I work afternoons.
3727445	eng	They were beggars.
3727456	eng	I'm under orders.
3727491	eng	They were deserters.
3727495	eng	I'm seeking answers.
3727501	eng	They walked downstairs.
3727511	eng	That'd take hours.
3727543	eng	Tom was ruthless.
3727574	eng	That's your guess.
3727759	eng	It looks hideous.
3727763	eng	Tom was dubious.
3727766	eng	Tom became conscious.
3727768	eng	You're extremely ingenious.
3727771	eng	Look, I'm serious.
3727772	eng	It's deadly serious.
3727779	eng	Tom was incredulous.
3727781	eng	That'd be dangerous.
3727798	eng	It's bad news.
3727846	eng	That'd be great.
3727855	eng	It feels great.
3727866	eng	Tom approved that.
3727910	eng	I'm watching that.
3728024	eng	Tom knew that.
3728039	eng	That'd be perfect.
3728040	eng	That's actually perfect.
3728069	eng	It's dead quiet.
3728123	eng	That's your gift.
3728211	eng	I'm waitressing tonight.
3728235	eng	It feels right.
3728268	eng	I've accepted it.
3728372	eng	Let's chuck it.
3728387	eng	That'd do it.
3728430	eng	That nails it.
3728443	eng	Everyone felt it.
3728448	eng	You've lost it.
3728497	eng	It doesn't fit.
3728520	eng	That's very elegant.
3728522	eng	Tom looked indignant.
3728524	eng	Tom seemed reluctant.
3728529	eng	That's very distant.
3728547	eng	That was evident.
3728551	eng	It wasn't sufficient.
3728553	eng	That's real convenient.
3728557	eng	Tom looked impatient.
3728559	eng	They became silent.
3728560	eng	They were silent.
3728562	eng	Tom fell silent.
3728649	eng	I feel different.
3728650	eng	It's been different.
3728656	eng	Let's be content.
3728657	eng	Tom was content.
3728659	eng	Tom couldn't paint.
3728676	eng	You're incredibly hot.
3728732	eng	We're worlds apart.
3728770	eng	That can't last.
3728792	eng	You're the guest.
3728807	eng	They were lost.
3728819	eng	You're the worst.
3728825	eng	I lucked out.
3728826	eng	I'm talked out.
3728827	eng	They walked out.
3728830	eng	I'm caffeined out.
3728832	eng	I'm tapped out.
3728918	eng	I've offended you.
3728995	eng	Nobody's forcing you.
3729034	eng	I'm learning Turkmen.
3729079	eng	It'd kill you.
3729214	eng	I've upset you.
3729235	eng	It'll cost you.
3729288	eng	It's excruciatingly slow.
3729293	eng	It's finished now.
3729684	eng	Tom hurried away.
3729701	eng	It'll go away.
3729740	eng	Come in already.
3729760	eng	Get up, everybody.
3729804	eng	They were wealthy.
3729815	eng	Tom smiled affably.
3729816	eng	Tom smiled amiably.
3729817	eng	Tom cried uncontrollably.
3729819	eng	Tom smiled uncomfortably.
3729820	eng	Tom fidgeted uncomfortably.
3729824	eng	Tom smiled humbly.
3729827	eng	Tom laughed good-naturedly.
3729828	eng	Tom smiled halfheartedly.
3729829	eng	Tom sighed profoundly.
3729830	eng	Tom smiled awkwardly.
3729831	eng	Tom smiled inwardly.
3729832	eng	Tom applauded loudly.
3729835	eng	It seemed likely.
3729837	eng	It seems likely.
3729853	eng	Tom smiled politely.
3729854	eng	Tom grimaced bravely.
3729855	eng	Tom smiled bravely.
3729857	eng	Tom smiled appreciatively.
3729858	eng	That'll never fly.
3729859	eng	That won't fly.
3729860	eng	Tom smiled briefly.
3729861	eng	Tom smiled admiringly.
3729863	eng	Tom smiled approvingly.
3729864	eng	Tom smiled knowingly.
3729865	eng	It's getting ugly.
3729883	eng	Tom smiled guiltily.
3729894	eng	Tom smiled skeptically.
3729898	eng	It feels silly.
3729902	eng	Tom slept peacefully.
3729904	eng	Tom smiled hopefully.
3729906	eng	Tom smiled gratefully.
3729908	eng	Tom smiled thoughtfully.
3729910	eng	Tom smiled warmly.
3729915	eng	Tom sighed deeply.
3729921	eng	Tom smiled eagerly.
3729923	eng	Tom cried bitterly.
3729924	eng	Tom smiled helplessly.
3729925	eng	Tom slept restlessly.
3729930	eng	Tom watched curiously.
3729933	eng	We waited anxiously.
3729936	eng	Tom frowned nervously.
3729988	eng	Tom laughed quietly.
3729989	eng	Tom ate quietly.
3729993	eng	Tom coughed softly.
3729994	eng	Tom cried softly.
3729996	eng	Tom grimaced slightly.
3729997	eng	Tom winced slightly.
3729998	eng	Tom blushed slightly.
3729999	eng	Tom flushed slightly.
3730000	eng	Tom smiled slightly.
3730001	eng	Tom shivered slightly.
3730005	eng	Tom smiled triumphantly.
3730006	eng	Tom smiled expectantly.
3730007	eng	Tom smiled hesitantly.
3730010	eng	Tom smiled innocently.
3730011	eng	Tom waited obediently.
3730012	eng	I'll wait patiently.
3730014	eng	Tom coughed violently.
3730017	eng	Tom smiled faintly.
3730021	eng	Tom nodded curtly.
3730025	eng	Know your enemy.
3730042	eng	That's real funny.
3730052	eng	I'm so sleepy.
3730060	eng	Tom pitied Mary.
3730061	eng	Tom confronted Mary.
3730062	eng	Tom eyed Mary.
3730159	eng	They grew angry.
3730183	eng	You better hurry.
3730219	eng	Tom has immunity.
3730255	eng	I'm so thirsty.
3730258	eng	You're so pretty.
3730479	eng	Is that agreeable?
3730480	eng	Isn't it remarkable?
3730483	eng	Isn't it profitable?
3730486	eng	Is this possible?
3730655	eng	Were you compassionate?
3730676	eng	What's your beef?
3730743	eng	Isn't it infuriating?
3730754	eng	Are you young?
3730765	eng	Isn't that childish?
3730916	eng	Were you disrespectful?
3731227	eng	Where's your captain?
3731500	eng	Where's your babysitter?
3731655	eng	Were you conscientious?
3731883	eng	Are you content?
3731990	eng	What drives you?
3732060	eng	What's with everybody?
3732071	eng	Isn't it lovely?
3732080	eng	What's the skinny?
3732143	eng	What a blessing!
3732144	eng	What rotten luck!
3732147	eng	What a letdown!
3732191	eng	Let's have tea.
3732193	eng	I've got claustrophobia.
3732239	eng	Tom felt fantastic.
3732256	eng	Someone must lead.
3732260	eng	Ask Tom instead.
3732263	eng	I'm going mad.
3732287	eng	We just landed.
3732296	eng	We could've managed.
3732301	eng	Nothing was changed.
3732302	eng	Everything was arranged.
3732311	eng	Tom wasn't punished.
3732315	eng	My battery died.
3732316	eng	Tom was satisfied.
3732317	eng	Tom wasn't satisfied.
3732321	eng	Tom seemed preoccupied.
3732336	eng	I'm already married.
3732339	eng	Tom wasn't worried.
3732350	eng	Tom was spoiled.
3732351	eng	Tom got killed.
3732353	eng	I was startled.
3732354	eng	It's all settled.
3732355	eng	Tom was puzzled.
3732384	eng	Tom sounds frightened.
3732385	eng	Tom never complained.
3732387	eng	Even Tom grinned.
3732398	eng	Tom seemed prepared.
3732405	eng	It's being repaired.
3732409	eng	Tom seemed tired.
3732416	eng	Everybody was tired.
3732431	eng	Tom was surprised.
3732439	eng	Tom seemed embarrassed.
3732441	eng	I'm not dressed.
3732449	eng	I'm getting confused.
3732458	eng	Well, it's complicated.
3732463	eng	Tom never hesitated.
3732488	eng	I must've fainted.
3732490	eng	Tom seemed disappointed.
3732502	eng	Tom looked interested.
3732503	eng	Tom seemed interested.
3732504	eng	Tom acted interested.
3732505	eng	They were interested.
3732506	eng	Tom was interested.
3732513	eng	Tom seemed relieved.
3732514	eng	Tom wasn't deceived.
3732523	eng	Tom seemed annoyed.
3732524	eng	Tom seemed dazed.
3732583	eng	Tom was old.
3732597	eng	Tom didn't stand.
3732626	eng	I didn't mind.
3732654	eng	They're no good.
3732657	eng	Everything was good.
3732658	eng	Tom wasn't good.
3732691	eng	That's just absurd.
3732720	eng	Tom wasn't nice.
3732728	eng	People might notice.
3732744	eng	Here's my chance.
3732760	eng	There was silence.
3732779	eng	We waited outside.
3732801	eng	I couldn't see.
3732802	eng	Now you're safe.
3732808	eng	You're perfectly safe.
3732826	eng	That's common knowledge.
3732827	eng	I didn't budge.
3732835	eng	It was strange.
3732841	eng	Tom's in charge.
3732887	eng	It's highly improbable.
3732893	eng	I'm very miserable.
3732902	eng	It's quite comfortable.
3732903	eng	Tom looked uncomfortable.
3732905	eng	I was uncomfortable.
3732907	eng	It seemed unbelievable.
3732911	eng	Anything seemed possible.
3732921	eng	It was irresistible.
3732950	eng	Tom didn't smile.
3732959	eng	It's amazingly simple.
3732969	eng	That's the rule.
3732973	eng	They bullied me.
3732976	eng	It interested me.
3733064	eng	Don't forget me.
3733132	eng	It's supper time.
3733181	eng	Let's get home.
3733251	eng	Tom wasn't alone.
3733277	eng	Nobody will care.
3733321	eng	Don't park here.
3733384	eng	It's still there.
3733394	eng	It's not there.
3733444	eng	Tom wasn't sure.
3733447	eng	That's pure conjecture.
3733465	eng	We need exercise.
3733468	eng	Stop that noise.
3733488	eng	That's complete nonsense.
3733490	eng	Stop this nonsense.
3733493	eng	I'd probably lose.
3733502	eng	Tom could refuse.
3733522	eng	There's the lighthouse.
3733559	eng	Tom felt desperate.
3733560	eng	Let me concentrate.
3733564	eng	Everything is white.
3733578	eng	Let me continue.
3733581	eng	It's quite true.
3733587	eng	That wasn't true.
3733605	eng	We'd better leave.
3733637	eng	It was excessive.
3733639	eng	It was effective.
3733685	eng	Don't repeat yourself.
3733692	eng	I know myself.
3733728	eng	I've missed something.
3733729	eng	You've omitted something.
3733732	eng	I've forgotten something.
3733738	eng	I forgot something.
3733742	eng	We said nothing.
3733743	eng	They did nothing.
3733747	eng	I've taken nothing.
3733782	eng	Tom changed everything.
3733783	eng	Tom fixed everything.
3733784	eng	I'll arrange everything.
3733799	eng	I've been thinking.
3733812	eng	Let's go bowling.
3733820	eng	It's very alarming.
3733823	eng	Something was happening.
3733838	eng	It's very entertaining.
3733862	eng	Your sister's sleeping.
3733877	eng	Tom didn't sing.
3733881	eng	Everything is missing.
3733883	eng	It's really confusing.
3733884	eng	It was amusing.
3733887	eng	Tom was sweating.
3733914	eng	It wasn't interesting.
3733915	eng	Isn't it interesting?
3733941	eng	You're not trying.
3733966	eng	Tom felt strong.
3733975	eng	Maybe I'm wrong.
3733981	eng	Everything was wrong.
3733990	eng	Tom wasn't young.
3734098	eng	Tom didn't laugh.
3734112	eng	That was enough.
3734113	eng	Once is enough.
3734114	eng	Love is enough.
3734116	eng	It isn't enough.
3734120	eng	It was tough.
3734125	eng	Tom looked foolish.
3734153	eng	They didn't speak.
3734201	eng	Tom couldn't talk.
3734250	eng	I'll find work.
3734260	eng	This didn't work.
3734290	eng	Everything's quite informal.
3734336	eng	You're very tall.
3734340	eng	We've done well.
3734342	eng	I'm quite well.
3734363	eng	Stand perfectly still.
3734388	eng	Always be careful.
3734399	eng	I was grateful.
3734400	eng	Don't be ungrateful.
3734401	eng	I'm not ungrateful.
3734402	eng	It's simply beautiful.
3734411	eng	It's just awful.
3734434	eng	Let's get them.
3734522	eng	Come here, Tom.
3734524	eng	Don't go, Tom.
3734527	eng	Don't cry, Tom.
3734528	eng	Don't disturb Tom.
3734535	eng	Nobody answered Tom.
3734539	eng	It disappointed Tom.
3734543	eng	I recognized Tom.
3734687	eng	It's only Tom.
3734719	eng	It's unusually warm.
3734753	eng	That's my plan.
3734786	eng	We were mistaken.
3734787	eng	You're quite mistaken.
3734808	eng	Anything might happen.
3734820	eng	We've already eaten.
3734858	eng	Tom wasn't in.
3734899	eng	We'll meet again.
3735122	eng	This won't burn.
3735131	eng	It's great fun.
3735155	eng	Tom didn't drown.
3735160	eng	I'm headed downtown.
3735161	eng	I'm heading downtown.
3735263	eng	Tom didn't go.
3735296	eng	Everybody said so.
3735299	eng	I've done so.
3735321	eng	Everything is cheap.
3735330	eng	Tom didn't sleep.
3735338	eng	Tom wasn't asleep.
3735393	eng	Tom couldn't help.
3735404	eng	Everybody looked up.
3735469	eng	Tom wasn't popular.
3735477	eng	Tom couldn't remember.
3735486	eng	I'm an officer.
3735547	eng	I'm a grandfather.
3735551	eng	We were together.
3735586	eng	I'm the gardener.
3735598	eng	They ate supper.
3735600	eng	Good job. Super.
3735614	eng	Stand up straighter.
3735615	eng	That's Tom's daughter.
3735630	eng	It's getting better.
3735644	eng	That's all over.
3735645	eng	The concert's over.
3735646	eng	The play's over.
3735679	eng	That's my chair.
3735703	eng	Tom wasn't poor.
3735710	eng	Consult your doctor.
3735767	eng	I'll explain afterwards.
3735775	eng	Tom never changes.
3735829	eng	Wipe your eyes.
3735924	eng	This almost works.
3735972	eng	Watch my fingers.
3735987	eng	Let's go indoors.
3736009	eng	It was useless.
3736010	eng	It's perfectly useless.
3736135	eng	Laughter is contagious.
3736137	eng	Now it's serious.
3736138	eng	It was serious.
3736139	eng	I'm rather curious.
3736140	eng	It's rather curious.
3736142	eng	I'm really curious.
3736145	eng	Tom seemed anxious.
3736156	eng	Don't be presumptuous.
3736157	eng	Tom seemed nervous.
3736161	eng	That's bad news.
3736206	eng	We're getting fat.
3736208	eng	Tom wasn't fat.
3736215	eng	Tom admitted that.
3736221	eng	Tom understood that.
3736324	eng	Everyone says that.
3736348	eng	Everybody knew that.
3736363	eng	It looks perfect.
3736364	eng	Tom might object.
3736368	eng	Tom was correct.
3736476	eng	It's almost midnight.
3736488	eng	Everything seemed right.
3736526	eng	I'll chance it.
3736529	eng	We'll manage it.
3736585	eng	Let's discuss it.
3736592	eng	Don't forget it.
3736597	eng	I've kept it.
3736618	eng	We didn't wait.
3736619	eng	Tom didn't wait.
3736622	eng	Eat more fruit.
3736642	eng	They're too difficult.
3736677	eng	You're very disobedient.
3736678	eng	It's very convenient.
3736683	eng	Let's be silent.
3736698	eng	Well, that's different.
3736702	eng	Tom was present.
3736707	eng	Tom can't paint.
3736710	eng	Tom didn't hunt.
3736739	eng	Tom was barefoot.
3736753	eng	Make an effort.
3736793	eng	You're my guest.
3736802	eng	Don't get lost.
3736814	eng	Have a donut.
3736818	eng	Tom'll find out.
3736884	eng	I'll teach you.
3737017	eng	That's over now.
3737065	eng	They didn't know.
3737075	eng	I'm going tomorrow.
3737133	eng	Tom apologized today.
3737189	eng	I overslept yesterday.
3737194	eng	Tom didn't pray.
3737214	eng	They won't stay.
3737220	eng	Tom drove away.
3737244	eng	We're all ready.
3737246	eng	Everything was ready.
3737248	eng	I'm always ready.
3737252	eng	They're not ready.
3737293	eng	Everyone wants money.
3737304	eng	Tom wanted sympathy.
3737312	eng	That was lucky.
3737315	eng	Tom failed miserably.
3737319	eng	Tom looks lonely.
3737322	eng	Watch me closely.
3737323	eng	Listen very closely.
3737349	eng	Listen very carefully.
3737350	eng	It went beautifully.
3737383	eng	Tom wasn't sleepy.
3737407	eng	Tom interrupted Mary.
3737408	eng	Tom obeyed Mary.
3737410	eng	Tom understood Mary.
3737493	eng	Tom knew Mary.
3737549	eng	Sometimes it's easy.
3737580	eng	My rifle's empty.
3737619	eng	Everything was dirty.
3737620	eng	Everything looks dirty.
3737627	eng	I wasn't thirsty.
3737631	eng	It's Tom's duty.
3737637	eng	I'm still dizzy.
3737667	eng	Are you wounded?
3737699	eng	Are you dressed?
3737704	eng	Are you related?
3737711	eng	Was Tom annoyed?
3737726	eng	How's Tom's cold?
3737734	eng	Did Tom mind?
3737754	eng	What's your advice?
3737869	eng	Has Tom gone?
3737907	eng	Who'll be there?
3737930	eng	Who wrote these?
3737941	eng	Where's Tom's house?
3737992	eng	How's your leg?
3738020	eng	When's Tom coming?
3738022	eng	What was happening?
3738046	eng	Isn't it boring?
3738047	eng	What're you insinuating?
3738048	eng	Where's the meeting?
3738068	eng	Is that wrong?
3738133	eng	Isn't she beautiful?
3738134	eng	Aren't they wonderful?
3738135	eng	Wasn't it awful?
3738147	eng	Was he Tom?
3738259	eng	What's the solution?
3738354	eng	Was Tom asleep?
3738390	eng	Who's the manager?
3738409	eng	Who's the loser?
3738411	eng	What's Tom after?
3738500	eng	Who brought this?
3738521	eng	Are they brothers?
3738525	eng	Are they sisters?
3738573	eng	Isn't it delicious?
3738575	eng	Isn't that curious?
3738636	eng	What's all that?
3738848	eng	Don't you know?
3738869	eng	Where's Tom today?
3738900	eng	Where were they?
3738927	eng	Is that satisfactory?
3739323	eng	I was ready.
3739689	eng	Great thanks, friends.
3740404	eng	We're speaking English.
3740406	eng	We're speaking Turkmen.
3740658	eng	Everybody is here.
3740683	eng	They started it.
3741123	eng	Possibly, it's true.
3741329	eng	You got cheated.
3746149	eng	I like climbing.
3747509	eng	That was foreseeable.
3748307	eng	Patience conquers all.
3748905	eng	I hate math.
3748909	eng	I hate mathematics.
3749196	eng	Everyone looks tired.
3752601	eng	Divide and rule!
3752961	eng	Savings start tomorrow!
3752964	eng	She prepared lunch.
3753523	eng	I am Charlie.
3754440	eng	I don't imbibe.
3755652	eng	I love God.
3756416	eng	Happy Walpurgis Night!
3756456	eng	He changed overnight.
3756531	eng	Christmas is here.
3756562	eng	Oh my God!
3756564	eng	You're so nice.
3757078	eng	He's already here.
3757248	eng	Another coffee, please.
3758155	eng	Draw a picture.
3758649	eng	He's partially right.
3758706	eng	She studies audiology.
3759389	eng	I am quenched.
3759403	eng	I am unthirsty.
3759858	eng	He became secretary.
3760561	eng	Bats use echolocation.
3760562	eng	Dolphins use echolocation.
3762714	eng	Who can choose?
3763305	eng	Tom won't sing.
3763306	eng	She works alone.
3763308	eng	Man is water.
3763313	eng	I detest fighting.
3763318	eng	I detest ironing.
3763323	eng	I was arrested.
3763329	eng	I sleep little.
3763586	eng	Is he reliable?
3763588	eng	Is she reliable?
3763719	eng	Hey, come here!
3764094	eng	You're not ugly.
3764896	eng	You aren't replaceable.
3764905	eng	His baptism's today.
3764945	eng	That's obviously inevitable.
3765169	eng	We're Facebook friends.
3765512	eng	Smoking is suicide.
3765539	eng	This doesn't burn.
3765653	eng	I'm not you.
3766084	eng	What is Tom?
3766209	eng	Who goes where?
3767484	eng	Come along, children.
3769648	eng	She was homesick.
3770293	eng	That's a sign.
3771246	eng	Here it comes!
3771545	eng	This never happens.
3772724	eng	The dog sleeps.
3772726	eng	Computers are machines.
3773422	eng	I crave knowledge.
3774856	eng	Something offended her.
3775038	eng	Thank you, too.
3777089	eng	She's waking up.
3778061	eng	You are guilty.
3778085	eng	Capricious as April.
3778785	eng	Did it work?
3779904	eng	Don't interrupt me!
3780551	eng	He is dead.
3783214	eng	She is homesick.
3785273	eng	We're finally alone.
3789146	eng	She interrupted me.
3790247	eng	He interrupted me.
3791676	eng	There's no suds.
3791792	eng	Are you widowed?
3794916	eng	Labor created man.
3795200	eng	That smells nice.
3797027	eng	He visited Tehran.
3798279	eng	He looks unhappy.
3799145	eng	I paid attention.
3799958	eng	He finally arrived!
3801913	eng	Tom slowly retreated.
3803131	eng	It's possible, right?
3804623	eng	It was Christmas.
3804626	eng	It was midnight.
3804637	eng	Dawn was breaking.
3804643	eng	He was dying.
3804646	eng	We were roommates.
3804664	eng	You were washed.
3804672	eng	She was good-hearted.
3804679	eng	She was miserable.
3804692	eng	I was self-confident.
3804693	eng	She was away.
3804749	eng	He was sleeping.
3804821	eng	We were reading.
3804854	eng	Tom was shouting.
3804867	eng	I was talkative.
3805034	eng	She's in Boston.
3806575	eng	Come and see!
3806801	eng	I consume sugar.
3809002	eng	Wait, there's more.
3812012	eng	This is me.
3812708	eng	I love it.
3813026	eng	They talked politics.
3813317	eng	I suspected nothing.
3813318	eng	Tom suspects nothing.
3815114	eng	Tom underestimated Marie.
3815916	eng	I'm Tom's guardian.
3817257	eng	I didn't read.
3818103	eng	Who attacked you?
3818330	eng	How was yesterday?
3818358	eng	I arrived yesterday.
3818383	eng	Who was wrong?
3818388	eng	Was Tom wrong?
3818404	eng	They're both wrong.
3818416	eng	What've you written?
3818428	eng	What's it worth?
3818432	eng	I expected worse.
3818513	eng	I love winter.
3818526	eng	Open your window.
3818532	eng	Did we win?
3818533	eng	Who should win?
3818535	eng	I always win.
3818552	eng	Where's your whistle?
3818558	eng	Who saw what?
3818561	eng	I was wet.
3818563	eng	They were wet.
3818602	eng	I wasn't well.
3818609	eng	You've chosen well.
3818759	eng	I prefer walking.
3818760	eng	I like walking.
3818764	eng	We were waiting.
3818776	eng	We never voted.
3818823	eng	Do something useful.
3818826	eng	Where's it used?
3818856	eng	Nobody understands us.
3818944	eng	Keep us updated.
3818956	eng	Let's get up.
3818967	eng	I woke up.
3818979	eng	I'm really unlucky.
3819020	eng	Here's your umbrella.
3819022	eng	You're very ugly.
3819023	eng	You aren't ugly.
3819027	eng	I made two.
3819030	eng	Tom hates TV.
3819062	eng	Was it true?
3819076	eng	That's all true.
3819084	eng	Someone's in trouble.
3819093	eng	I'm already tired.
3819129	eng	It'll be tough.
3819152	eng	You're right, too.
3819179	eng	What'll happen tonight?
3819197	eng	They'll arrive tonight.
3819275	eng	Who appointed Tom?
3819290	eng	What's wrong, Tom?
3819325	eng	That's for Tom.
3819418	eng	Let's congratulate Tom.
3819494	eng	Let's eat together.
3819505	eng	We cried together.
3819514	eng	Who's absent today?
3819723	eng	Hold me tighter.
3819730	eng	Where's Tom's ticket?
3819850	eng	You'll love this.
3819864	eng	I recommend this.
3819867	eng	We needed this.
3819879	eng	I was thinking.
3819934	eng	They're all thieves.
3819939	eng	What are they?
3819947	eng	I made these.
3819970	eng	They're already there.
3819972	eng	Throw it there.
3819977	eng	They're always there.
3819992	eng	We were there.
3820012	eng	What happens then?
3820052	eng	You'll find them.
3820114	eng	Who'll believe that?
3820259	eng	I'd forgotten that.
3820327	eng	I hate terrorism.
3820330	eng	Tom was tense.
3820333	eng	Let's play tennis.
3820348	eng	I like teaching.
3820385	eng	Your daughter's tall.
3820403	eng	I was sympathetic.
3820418	eng	I don't swear.
3820426	eng	I love surprises.
3820428	eng	Was anyone surprised?
3820451	eng	Who's your supervisor?
3820454	eng	I love sunflowers.
3820469	eng	Where's Tom's suitcase?
3820477	eng	Is this suitable?
3820491	eng	We will succeed.
3820497	eng	I need subtitles.
3820511	eng	I've been stupid.
3820512	eng	We're all stupid.
3820527	eng	I was studying.
3820537	eng	They're all strong.
3820557	eng	It sounds strange.
3820563	eng	It seemed strange.
3820599	eng	I've made stew.
3820603	eng	We can't stay.
3820627	eng	Finally, someone spoke.
3820629	eng	It was spectacular.
3820641	eng	I'm dreadfully sorry.
3820645	eng	You'll be sorry.
3820660	eng	You'll die soon.
3820731	eng	I thought so.
3820733	eng	I guess so.
3820738	eng	We hope so.
3820747	eng	Do you snore?
3820751	eng	It's a snap.
3820767	eng	Tom spoke slowly.
3820776	eng	Was Tom sleeping?
3820817	eng	That's very simple.
3820822	eng	Everyone was silent.
3820849	eng	Where's the shovel?
3820884	eng	I like sewing.
3820889	eng	Are they serious?
3820890	eng	It's very serious.
3820898	eng	It was sensational.
3820954	eng	I got scammed.
3821008	eng	I was satisfied.
3821063	eng	I felt safer.
3821064	eng	We aren't safe.
3821081	eng	Remember this rule.
3821120	eng	There's no risk.
3821122	eng	Your telephone's ringing.
3821123	eng	Your phone's ringing.
3821126	eng	Who was right?
3821129	eng	Was Tom right?
3821134	eng	You're exaggerating, right?
3821159	eng	They've just returned.
3821164	eng	I'm now retired.
3821178	eng	Tom never responded.
3821205	eng	That's worth remembering.
3821210	eng	Is it reliable?
3821211	eng	Is Tom reliable?
3821216	eng	We aren't related.
3821218	eng	Maybe we're related.
3821220	eng	I've already registered.
3821230	eng	I've fully recovered.
3821239	eng	Please be reasonable.
3821246	eng	We're probably ready.
3821269	eng	It's probably raining.
3821270	eng	It's stopped raining.
3821281	eng	You can't quit.
3821298	eng	Stop asking questions.
3821318	eng	I love purple.
3821320	eng	Was Tom punished?
3821322	eng	Tom was punished.
3821338	eng	Keep your promises.
3821347	eng	We've made progress.
3821391	eng	We're all prisoners.
3821405	eng	What've you prepared?
3821408	eng	It was predictable.
3821419	eng	Was it possible?
3821423	eng	That's entirely possible.
3821430	eng	Please think positively.
3821439	eng	We're very poor.
3821440	eng	They're really poor.
3821453	eng	Tom writes poetry.
3821454	eng	I love poetry.
3821455	eng	I have pneumonia.
3821456	eng	Call a plumber.
3821475	eng	This wasn't planned.
3821486	eng	Where's this place?
3821499	eng	It's a pineapple.
3821522	eng	You're very photogenic.
3821524	eng	I made photocopies.
3821542	eng	It seems perfect.
3821568	eng	We'll wait patiently.
3821577	eng	What's your password?
3821644	eng	I've already packed.
3821645	eng	Where's the package?
3821648	eng	Are they pacifists?
3821649	eng	They were pacifists.
3821661	eng	Throw them overboard.
3821673	eng	It's chilly outside.
3821677	eng	It's drizzling outside.
3821703	eng	Time's running out.
3821707	eng	I passed out.
3821724	eng	You're very original.
3821728	eng	They obeyed orders.
3821763	eng	I want one.
3821850	eng	They're already occupied.
3821859	eng	They're really obese.
3821963	eng	Call Tom now.
3821971	eng	Go there now.
3821981	eng	I hadn't noticed.
3821988	eng	Where's my notebook?
3821998	eng	I guess not.
3822005	eng	Is it normal?
3822022	eng	Everyone said no.
3822075	eng	It's very new.
3822076	eng	I was new.
3822080	eng	Tom sounds nervous.
3822089	eng	I hate needles.
3822115	eng	Was it necessary?
3822121	eng	That seems natural.
3822140	eng	It's a myth.
3822152	eng	I'm surprised myself.
3822217	eng	We're in mourning.
3822261	eng	We want more.
3822272	eng	I expected more.
3822333	eng	It's only Monday.
3822336	eng	See you Monday.
3822343	eng	Yesterday was Monday.
3822377	eng	You must've misunderstood.
3822388	eng	You're probably mistaken.
3822433	eng	Where's the milk?
3822435	eng	I like milk.
3822448	eng	What's this mess?
3822482	eng	What's this medicine?
3822506	eng	Who saw me?
3822556	eng	Why thank me?
3822589	eng	Everyone, follow me.
3822603	eng	You aren't me.
3822605	eng	That bothers me.
3822607	eng	Everyone loves me.
3822699	eng	Stop distracting me.
3822700	eng	Stop aggravating me.
3822701	eng	Stop embarrassing me.
3822703	eng	They're bothering me.
3822738	eng	You've misunderstood me.
3822747	eng	Tom interrupted me.
3822870	eng	Tom nudged Mary.
3822905	eng	Watch your luggage.
3822909	eng	Try your luck.
3822915	eng	This is love.
3822930	eng	What've you lost?
3822940	eng	I never lose.
3822977	eng	What causes loneliness?
3822978	eng	It seems logical.
3822996	eng	Let me live.
3822999	eng	I'm just listening.
3823017	eng	What's the limit?
3823055	eng	I love libraries.
3823067	eng	That's not legal.
3823121	eng	You seem lazy.
3823146	eng	You'll understand later.
3823159	eng	I'm always late.
3823169	eng	You were late.
3823197	eng	Didn't you know?
3823253	eng	Tom was joking.
3823255	eng	We were joking.
3823360	eng	I'd buy it.
3823427	eng	I'd do it.
3823451	eng	I wrote it.
3823453	eng	I hate it.
3823480	eng	I loved it.
3823482	eng	I appreciated it.
3823528	eng	I won't interfere.
3823535	eng	These seem interesting.
3823540	eng	What's your intention?
3823547	eng	You're too insistent.
3823549	eng	Was anyone injured?
3823553	eng	They were injured.
3823554	eng	We were injured.
3823580	eng	You've definitely improved.
3823597	eng	I feel important.
3823609	eng	That's not illegal.
3823611	eng	You're just idiots.
3823616	eng	You're too idealistic.
3823638	eng	I hate hypocrites.
3823641	eng	It really hurts.
3823645	eng	Was anyone hurt?
3823648	eng	It didn't hurt.
3823650	eng	My legs hurt.
3823659	eng	Many people hunt.
3823730	eng	Where's my horse?
3823742	eng	You're very honest.
3823761	eng	Where's your home?
3823807	eng	Tom staggered home.
3823878	eng	Are you here?
3823958	eng	You're never here.
3823989	eng	Everybody, come here.
3824032	eng	It'll be helpful.
3824036	eng	Did you help?
3824150	eng	Everyone worked hard.
3824151	eng	We worked hard.
3824180	eng	I deserve happiness.
3824182	eng	Sometimes it happens.
3824187	eng	It still happens.
3824211	eng	Guess what happened.
3824254	eng	Are you handicapped?
3824273	eng	Brush your hair.
3824322	eng	Isn't winning great?
3824327	eng	We were grateful.
3824346	eng	They're always good.
3824360	eng	It tasted good.
3824423	eng	Raise your glasses.
3824425	eng	Aren't you glad?
3824466	eng	Enjoy the game.
3824514	eng	You're very friendly.
3824524	eng	I travel frequently.
3824597	eng	We'll never forget.
3824665	eng	These aren't fish.
3824684	eng	We've already finished.
3824691	eng	I was fine.
3824741	eng	Who's your father?
3824749	eng	I was fat.
3824751	eng	You've gotten fat.
3824776	eng	Prices are falling.
3824780	eng	You weren't fair.
3824802	eng	Now everything's exposed.
3824809	eng	There's no explanation.
3824847	eng	I was excited.
3824862	eng	You're always exaggerating.
3824863	eng	Maybe I exaggerated.
3824864	eng	Now don't exaggerate.
3824865	eng	You always exaggerate.
3824878	eng	Throw away everything.
3824884	eng	Time heals everything.
3824885	eng	Tom notices everything.
3824904	eng	We've arranged everything.
3824912	eng	I hate everyone.
3824913	eng	I convinced everyone.
3824922	eng	Tom has escaped.
3824928	eng	They're all equal.
3824931	eng	Wasn't it enough?
3824932	eng	Wasn't that enough?
3824942	eng	Stop the engine.
3824951	eng	It's the end.
3824974	eng	Do something else.
3824984	eng	You weren't elected.
3824996	eng	I'm still eating.
3825012	eng	This was easy.
3825013	eng	Everything was easy.
3825037	eng	We were dumbfounded.
3825042	eng	They weren't drunk.
3825043	eng	We weren't drunk.
3825044	eng	Everyone is drunk.
3825319	eng	That's really disgusting.
3825328	eng	Tom is discouraged.
3825347	eng	Tom made dinner.
3825348	eng	I've made dinner.
3825361	eng	Has someone died?
3825367	eng	Love doesn't die.
3825399	eng	This is depressing.
3825400	eng	I'm very depressed.
3825406	eng	It sounds delicious.
3825436	eng	Apparently, they're dead.
3825508	eng	Tom didn't cry.
3825514	eng	I hate crowds.
3825524	eng	Is it credible?
3825534	eng	Everyone went crazy.
3825538	eng	You're just cowards.
3825539	eng	Run for cover.
3825541	eng	It takes courage.
3825556	eng	What'll it cost?
3825558	eng	They're all corrupt.
3825573	eng	I wasn't convinced.
3825585	eng	What's the connection?
3825586	eng	Is this confusing?
3825592	eng	You'll be confused.
3825597	eng	Tom eventually confessed.
3825612	eng	I don't compromise.
3825614	eng	Was it complicated?
3825615	eng	Is it complicated?
3825619	eng	It was complicated.
3825628	eng	No one complained.
3825630	eng	We shouldn't complain.
3825631	eng	We can't complain.
3825647	eng	Were you comfortable?
3825663	eng	Where's my comb?
3825693	eng	It was cloudy.
3825702	eng	Everything is closed.
3825713	eng	I was cleaning.
3825744	eng	What's your choice?
3825755	eng	It was chilly.
3825758	eng	We aren't children.
3825788	eng	Nothing ever changes.
3825802	eng	You never change.
3825839	eng	I hate cats.
3825948	eng	I love cake.
3825951	eng	I need caffeine.
3825990	eng	It smells burnt.
3826018	eng	Take this brochure.

4495323	eng	Are they purple?
4495324	eng	Who's with Tom?
4495325	eng	What's up, Tom?
4495326	eng	Tom was second.
4495327	eng	Tom was fuming.
4495328	eng	Tom was absent.
4495331	eng	This is unsafe.
4495332	eng	Sales are down.
4495334	eng	It's been good.
4495335	eng	It'll be chaos.
4495336	eng	Tom was third.
4495337	eng	Tom was ready.
4495338	eng	Tom was irked.
4495339	eng	Tom was first.
4495341	eng	It was untrue.
4495342	eng	We were late.
4495343	eng	Tom was next.
4495344	eng	That was big.
4495345	eng	It was there.
4495346	eng	Tom was ill.
4495347	eng	How was Tom?
4495348	eng	Tom was OK.
4495349	eng	It was big.
4495350	eng	Are you 18?
4495369	eng	Tom should've surrendered.
4495395	eng	What total nonsense!
4495396	eng	The group disbanded.
4495401	eng	Maybe Tom panicked.
4495404	eng	Tom embraced Mary.
4495407	eng	What a hypocrite!
4495409	eng	Tom detests Mary.
4495410	eng	They all scoffed.
4495411	eng	Who stabbed Tom?
4495412	eng	What a treasure!
4495413	eng	What a prospect!
4495414	eng	What a pleasure!
4495416	eng	No one panicked.
4495417	eng	Good luck, Tom.
4495437	eng	Those are unacceptable.
4495438	eng	That was unacceptable.
4495439	eng	Either is acceptable.
4495455	eng	What was accomplished?
4495473	eng	What an achievement!
4495474	eng	What was achieved?
4495485	eng	That'll be addressed.
4495501	eng	Tom admitted defeat.
4495512	eng	Caution is advised.
4495537	eng	Tom strongly disagrees.
4495538	eng	Tom agreed reluctantly.
4495539	eng	Tom agreed immediately.
4495541	eng	Tom eventually agreed.
4495550	eng	Tom still disagrees.
4495552	eng	Not everyone agrees.
4495553	eng	I disagree strongly.
4495554	eng	We basically agree.
4495555	eng	Tom quickly agreed.
4495556	eng	Tom finally agreed.
4495559	eng	Maybe you disagree.
4495560	eng	I completely agree.
4495563	eng	We totally agree.

4495605	eng	I was amazed.
4495607	eng	It's rather amusing.
4495615	eng	It was annoying.

4495640	eng	Tom wanted answers.
4495643	eng	Here's the answer.
4495644	eng	Tom answered yes.

4495705	eng	Who approved this?
4495751	eng	Help finally arrived.
4495827	eng	Never assume that.
4495828	eng	That sounds reassuring.
4495853	eng	Attendance is free.
4495854	eng	It was attractive.
4495858	eng	That was unavoidable.
4495911	eng	Let's double back.
4495937	eng	Tom barely escaped.
4495960	eng	Tom was unbeatable.
4495961	eng	Tom is unbeatable.
4495987	eng	Tom became alarmed.
4496001	eng	Trouble began immediately.
4496050	eng	They believed that.
4496051	eng	Who believes that?
4496054	eng	Tom believed it.
4496055	eng	I believe that.
4496060	eng	It belongs there.
4496084	eng	Tom blamed himself.
4496090	eng	I've been blessed.
4496096	eng	Roads are blocked.
4496102	eng	There's blood everywhere.
4496103	eng	There was blood.
4496104	eng	It was mind-blowing.
4496123	eng	Business was booming.
4496133	eng	Stop bothering Tom.
4496139	eng	Boxing is boring.
4496164	eng	Everything is broken.
4496173	eng	Breathing was difficult.
4496185	eng	Bring your daughter.
4496186	eng	What'll Tom bring?
4496187	eng	Bring a camera.
4496188	eng	Bring a lunch.
4496213	eng	Press the button.

4496314	eng	Who would've cared?
4496317	eng	Does anybody care?
4496318	eng	Who really cares?
4496321	eng	They carry firearms.
4496339	eng	That's the catch.
4496340	eng	Who caught Tom?
4496365	eng	We should've celebrated.
4496377	eng	It's been challenging.
4496380	eng	There are challenges.
4496383	eng	That's a challenge.
4496384	eng	It's a challenge.
4496416	eng	Things eventually changed.
4496423	eng	Hopefully, that'll change.

4496541	eng	They cheered loudly.
4496543	eng	They were cheerful.
4496544	eng	The fans cheered.
4496553	eng	Tom chuckled quietly.
4496559	eng	Nobody claimed responsibility.
4496576	eng	It was clean.
4496599	eng	That seems clear.
4496711	eng	Please come quickly.
4496715	eng	Safety comes first.
4496719	eng	Tom's turn came.
4496721	eng	Tom came next.
4496734	eng	Comparisons are difficult.
4496740	eng	Prices are competitive.
4496743	eng	It was competitive.
4496748	eng	Customers haven't complained.
4496751	eng	We aren't complaining.
4496753	eng	Tom rarely complains.
4496754	eng	We didn't complain.
4496786	eng	It was incomplete.
4496799	eng	That sounds complicated.
4496800	eng	This is complicated.
4496825	eng	People are concerned.
4496828	eng	That's the concern.
4496830	eng	That concerns me.
4496848	eng	That sounds confusing.
4496852	eng	Isn't that confusing?
4496856	eng	No one's confused.
4496857	eng	Are they confused?
4496902	eng	This will continue.

4496930	eng	Tom was convinced.
4496931	eng	It was convincing.
4496940	eng	Tom can't cook.
4496953	eng	Neither is correct.
4496954	eng	You are incorrect.
4497062	eng	That couldn't happen.
4497070	eng	Tom could've died.
4497074	eng	Could it happen?
4497077	eng	We count everything.
4497078	eng	Every penny counts.

4497096	eng	I started crying.
4497097	eng	I cried today.
4497098	eng	I cried, too.

5738405	eng	Everybody's turning around.
5738414	eng	Diversify your investments.
5738519	eng	We've never re-negotiated.
5739355	eng	There's justifiable anger.
5740248	eng	I can't draw.
5740581	eng	Please provide references.
5740706	eng	It's definitely different.
5740796	eng	Investors want assurances.
5742039	eng	Here's another prediction.
5742054	eng	Everything's within reach.
5742057	eng	Everything seems possible.
5742063	eng	Everybody pulled together.
5742495	eng	I'm on leave.
5742535	eng	Details remain classified.
5742543	eng	Conversation is important.
5742767	eng	Construction began Monday.
5742784	eng	Boycotts change companies.
5742856	eng	He planted trees.
5743491	eng	You're really incredible.
5743861	eng	That's always broken.
5743903	eng	Tom is immortal.
5743904	eng	You're too small.
5744119	eng	Tom laughed half-heartedly.
5744201	eng	We're terribly concerned.
5744204	eng	We're still deliberating.
5744209	eng	We're officially engaged.
5744219	eng	We're complete opposites.
5744269	eng	We need decentralization.
5744341	eng	This seems revolutionary.
5744343	eng	This seems contradictory.
5744459	eng	There's always something.
5744558	eng	That's absolutely untrue.
5744560	eng	That's absolutely absurd.
5744612	eng	There's snow everywhere.
5744697	eng	Rearrange your furniture.
5744816	eng	It's something different.
5744975	eng	I'm actually self-taught.
5745057	eng	Tom unexpectedly vanished.
5745313	eng	Contact your congressman.
5745379	eng	You've done beautifully.
5745715	eng	What a day.
5745927	eng	We're certainly curious.
5745963	eng	We missed opportunities.
5746007	eng	Treason is unpardonable.
5746211	eng	Skateboarding has grown.
5746307	eng	It's quite intimidating.
5746642	eng	I'm deeply disappointed.
5746915	eng	Everything just happens.
5746918	eng	Everyone helps everyone.
5746989	eng	Tom doesn't discriminate.
5747098	eng	We welcome submissions.
5747158	eng	This seems inefficient.
5747194	eng	They've been fantastic.
5747196	eng	They're urging caution.
5747215	eng	There were compromises.
5747266	eng	That'll require fixing.
5747293	eng	Stipulations were made.
5747317	eng	Protests must continue.
5747358	eng	Life became unbearable.
5747377	eng	It's really remarkable.
5747397	eng	It's entirely possible.
5747453	eng	Tom understands physics.
5747487	eng	Investors were pleased.
5747494	eng	I've attended meetings.
5747509	eng	I'm quietly optimistic.
5747548	eng	I'll definitely comply.
5747549	eng	I'll continue training.
5747571	eng	Tom outsmarted everyone.
5747664	eng	Tom isn't irreplaceable.
5747761	eng	Everything was cleaned.
5747763	eng	Everything seems ideal.
5747764	eng	Everything looks right.
5747772	eng	Evaluate your progress.
5747778	eng	Don't trouble yourself.
5747779	eng	Don't concern yourself.
5747791	eng	Conditions are unusual.
5747793	eng	Celebrate your success.
5747805	eng	Blindfold your partner.
5747808	eng	Awareness is important.
5747890	eng	We're total opposites.
5747898	eng	We're learning things.
5747901	eng	We're changing course.
5747905	eng	We're always cautious.
5747908	eng	We'll manage, somehow.
5747913	eng	We'll accept anything.
5747953	eng	We haven't progressed.
5747980	eng	We bonded immediately.
5748027	eng	They've tried torture.
5748031	eng	They were traumatized.
5748046	eng	There were exceptions.
5748048	eng	There were challenges.
5748217	eng	Sound quality matters.
5748220	eng	Share your experience.
5748225	eng	Privacy doesn't exist.
5748226	eng	Present your argument.
5748232	eng	Pick something better.
5748235	eng	People were surprised.
5748249	eng	Nothing really worked.
5748259	eng	Never lose confidence.
5748322	eng	It's been frustrating.
5748327	eng	It'll help indirectly.
5748401	eng	Tom likes birdwatching.
5748417	eng	I'm very appreciative.
5748983	eng	Tom isn't conventional.
5749804	eng	Tom was mortified.
5751665	eng	You had enough.
5751697	eng	Tom saw enough.
5751712	eng	Tom expects so.
5751734	eng	Come without delay.
5751928	eng	I'm absolutely elated.
5752072	eng	Here's an explanation.
5752087	eng	Get everyone involved.
5752089	eng	Gangsters kill people.
5752090	eng	Funding has increased.
5752096	eng	Experience wins games.
5752098	eng	Expand your territory.
5752099	eng	Everything seems hard.
5752108	eng	Enjoy your retirement.
5752119	eng	Do something positive.
5752138	eng	Call your congressman.
5752147	eng	Be extremely cautious.
5752167	eng	You're halfway there.
5752181	eng	Tom believes otherwise.
5752183	eng	Why worry needlessly?
5752193	eng	Tom became intoxicated.
5752198	eng	Who understands this?
5752200	eng	Who should supervise?
5752201	eng	Who needs commentary?
5752209	eng	What's your reaction?
5752228	eng	We're really stumped.
5752231	eng	We're only fishermen.
5752233	eng	We're not warmongers.
5752236	eng	We're not economists.
5752239	eng	We're moving forward.
5752240	eng	We're just different.
5752242	eng	We're gaining ground.
5752243	eng	We're already inside.
5752258	eng	We'll be cooperating.
5752278	eng	We need transparency.
5752289	eng	Tom's friends laughed.
5752297	eng	We had opportunities.
5752301	eng	Tom would've approved.
5752356	eng	This changes nothing.
5752363	eng	They're brave people.
5752374	eng	They look disgusting.
5752396	eng	There were struggles.
5752415	eng	Tom smiled pleasantly.
5752428	eng	That's changing, too.
5752438	eng	That rapidly changed.
5752440	eng	That quickly changed.
5752443	eng	That might've worked.
5752455	eng	Stop this squabbling.
5752456	eng	Stop being difficult.
5752457	eng	Tom requested seafood.
5752460	eng	Tom remains skeptical.
5752465	eng	Residents were upset.
5752468	eng	Perhaps there's hope.
5752474	eng	Opinions vary widely.
5752492	eng	Mistakes will happen.
5753201	eng	Lessons were learned.
5753205	eng	Join the competition.
5753211	eng	It's really relaxing.
5753212	eng	Tom looked nonplussed.
5753213	eng	It's really gorgeous.
5753218	eng	Tom looked bewildered.
5753222	eng	It was unforgettable.
5753227	eng	Tom left empty-handed.
5753230	eng	Tom left disappointed.
5753258	eng	It definitely helped.
5753276	eng	Injuries will happen.
5753277	eng	Images are important.
5753283	eng	I'm really satisfied.
5753444	eng	Honesty is paramount.
5753459	eng	Everything looks bad.
5753463	eng	Everybody looked bad.
5753465	eng	Education is crucial.
5753466	eng	Drowsy driving kills.
5753470	eng	Tom finally confessed.
5753471	eng	Determine your goals.
5753474	eng	Children were crying.
5753475	eng	Cherish your friends.
5753495	eng	Answer the questions.
5753578	eng	You're hardly alone.
5753585	eng	Tom denies wrongdoing.
5753598	eng	Witches don't exist.
5753603	eng	Tom clearly succeeded.
5753611	eng	What was surprising?
5753620	eng	We're still talking.
5753622	eng	We're still digging.
5753626	eng	We're not squatters.
5753716	eng	We're breaking even.
5753721	eng	Tom behaved strangely.
5753729	eng	We remained friends.
5753731	eng	We really connected.
5753735	eng	We needed specifics.
5753739	eng	Mary looked ravishing.
5753934	eng	This latrine stinks.
5753946	eng	They're fixing that.
5753952	eng	They look excellent.
5753962	eng	They began chanting.
5753964	eng	There were protests.
5754207	eng	They're my books.
5754351	eng	Tom works diligently.
5754364	eng	That's what happens.
5754375	eng	Tom was unbelievable.
5754376	eng	That's pure rubbish.
5754377	eng	That's our position.
5754379	eng	That's our criteria.
5754380	eng	That's our approach.
5754386	eng	That's my objective.
5754388	eng	That's my complaint.
5754389	eng	That's my challenge.
5754452	eng	Tom was nice-looking.
5754459	eng	Start the countdown.
5754472	eng	Protect your family.
5754474	eng	Prepare for landing.
5754475	eng	Please come forward.
5754478	eng	People seemed dazed.
5754481	eng	People have choices.
5754505	eng	Neither will happen.
5754514	eng	Make everyone happy.
5754537	eng	It's been wonderful.
5754540	eng	It's been fantastic.
5754551	eng	Tom returned quickly.
5754575	eng	Tom proved otherwise.
5754608	eng	Tom loves nightclubs.
5754611	eng	Tom loves ceremonies.
5754614	eng	Tom looks incredible.
5754617	eng	Tom later apologized.
5754636	eng	It already happened.
5754646	eng	Identify your goals.
5754654	eng	I'm truly horrified.
5754655	eng	I'm too competitive.
5754661	eng	I'm so disappointed.
5754663	eng	I'm really prepared.
5754666	eng	I'm quite confident.
5754729	eng	Tom initially agreed.
5754780	eng	Tom didn't elaborate.
5754836	eng	History doesn't lie.
5754857	eng	Everyone gets along.
5754859	eng	Every dollar counts.
5754861	eng	Dragons don't exist.
5754863	eng	Don't stop learning.
5756278	eng	I can't surf.
5756280	eng	I can't snowboard.
5756433	eng	She blushed furiously.
5756492	eng	Maybe they're friends.
5756559	eng	This feels familiar.
5756574	eng	I am drunk.
5756579	eng	I've totally forgotten.
5756620	eng	They were asleep.
5756640	eng	Don't get defensive.
5756649	eng	Details are sketchy.
5756650	eng	Change came quickly.
5756668	eng	All attempts failed.
5756671	eng	You're never alone.
5756678	eng	Tom wasn't deterred.
5756683	eng	Yesterday was hard.
5756707	eng	What's their value?
5756709	eng	What's the process?
5756710	eng	What's left behind?
5756711	eng	Tom wants vengeance.
5756717	eng	Tom stayed positive.
5756718	eng	What prompted that?
5756731	eng	We're partners now.
5756735	eng	Tom remains defiant.
5756736	eng	We're human beings.
5756743	eng	We were struggling.
5756786	eng	Tom looked defeated.
5756800	eng	War seems imminent.
5756802	eng	Walk when possible.
5756803	eng	Voice your opinion.
5756830	eng	This is everything.
5756838	eng	This feels amazing.
5756840	eng	Tom is sharp-witted.
5756844	eng	They're our heroes.
5756845	eng	They're only ideas.
5756847	eng	They're miles away.
5756854	eng	They have declined.
5756859	eng	They approached us.
5756862	eng	There are traitors.
5756865	eng	The wait continues.
5756866	eng	The tent collapsed.
5756873	eng	Tom is dark-skinned.
5756875	eng	The latrine stinks.
5756878	eng	The feud continues.
5756881	eng	That's pretty cold.
5756884	eng	That's normal here.
5756887	eng	That's no accident.
5756893	eng	That's easy enough.
5756896	eng	That'll come later.
5756975	eng	I needlessly prepared?
5757031	eng	Look! An abelia!
5757052	eng	Look, an acacia!
5757073	eng	Look, a mahogany!
5757078	eng	Look, an acerola!
5757081	eng	Look, an acokanthera!
5757086	eng	Look, an adenium!
5757094	eng	Look, an agave!
5757099	eng	Look, an ailanthus!
5757343	eng	That hasn't helped.
5757344	eng	Thanks for nothing.
5757350	eng	State your reasons.
5757352	eng	Start your engines.
5757353	eng	Share your opinion.
5757358	eng	Pets are wonderful.
5757359	eng	People kill people.
5757362	eng	Oil prices plunged.
5757374	eng	Maybe that'll work.
5757384	eng	Tom died tragically.
5757398	eng	Keep going forward.
5757408	eng	It's nothing major.
5757411	eng	It's just business.
5757416	eng	It's been horrible.
5757420	eng	It'll be invisible.
5757428	eng	It was superficial.
5757446	eng	It was astonishing.
5757459	eng	It looks promising.
5757461	eng	It looked hopeless.
5757466	eng	Tom won everything.
5757477	eng	It changed nothing.
5757492	eng	I've been arrested.
5757494	eng	I'm working harder.
5757498	eng	I'm still positive.
5757500	eng	I'm still learning.
5757503	eng	I'm not frustrated.
5757504	eng	I'm just different.
5757511	eng	Tom proved himself.
5757512	eng	I'm getting poorer.
5757514	eng	Tom prepared lunch.
5757518	eng	I'm fairly pleased.
5757519	eng	I'm considering it.
5757528	eng	I'll stay involved.
5757530	eng	I'll read anything.
5757541	eng	Tom looked awesome.
5757555	eng	I smell corruption.
5757556	eng	Tom knows business.
5757557	eng	I share everything.
5757566	eng	I missed something.
5757571	eng	Tom isn't employed.
5757580	eng	Tom is unrealistic.
5757688	eng	Have some patience.
5757691	eng	Go build something.
5757708	eng	Can anyone comment?
5757713	eng	Tom didn't survive.
5757717	eng	You're just wrong.
5757718	eng	You're famous now.
5757720	eng	You're all prudes.
5757724	eng	Why not apologize?
5757732	eng	Where's my refund?
5757735	eng	What troubles you?
5757744	eng	We've wronged you.
5757747	eng	We're not closing.
5757748	eng	We're good enough.
5757750	eng	We're crowded now.
5757756	eng	We ship worldwide.
5757759	eng	We parted friends.
5757763	eng	We must celebrate.
5757764	eng	Please support Tom.
5757779	eng	Here's Tom's reply.
5757782	eng	Who's Tom Jackson?
5757787	eng	Warn your friends.
5757789	eng	This really works.
5757790	eng	Things went wrong.
5757792	eng	They're all jerks.
5757794	eng	Tom would approve.
5757800	eng	Tom wasn't famous.
5757811	eng	That's no defense.
5757813	eng	That's my feeling.
5757816	eng	That sounds juicy.
5757818	eng	Tom was petrified.
5757823	eng	Tell me something.
5757831	eng	Refresh my memory.
5757832	eng	Protect your eyes.
5757834	eng	People went crazy.
5757835	eng	People want stuff.
5757836	eng	Tom vomited twice.
5757837	eng	Our schools stink.
5757838	eng	Our lives changed.
5757848	eng	Tom smelled smoke.
5757849	eng	Let's not quibble.
5757854	eng	Tom received help.
5757855	eng	It's truly tragic.
5757857	eng	Tom reads Chinese.
5757859	eng	It's long overdue.
5757862	eng	It's been amazing.
5757876	eng	It takes practice.
5757877	eng	It takes patience.
5757878	eng	Tom loves rituals.
5757881	eng	Tom loves company.
5757889	eng	It clearly worked.
5757890	eng	Tom looks haggard.
5757897	eng	Is nothing sacred?
5757898	eng	I've been elected.
5757904	eng	I'm not switching.
5757908	eng	Tom is mysterious.
5757919	eng	I would volunteer.
5757929	eng	Tom heard yelling.
5757944	eng	Tom had questions.
5757948	eng	I repeated myself.
5757949	eng	I remain doubtful.
5757950	eng	Tom cursed loudly.
5757953	eng	Tom couldn't move.
5757980	eng	Sweet dreams, Tom.
5758010	eng	Here's one reason.
5758017	eng	Tom writes badly.
5758018	eng	Don't be provoked.
5758024	eng	Count your assets.
5758025	eng	Control your kids.
5758026	eng	Tom went bananas.
5758027	eng	Control your fear.
5758028	eng	Cite your sources.
5758029	eng	Tom was upstairs.
5758033	eng	All things change.
5758047	eng	Tom was pardoned.
5758048	eng	What's it really?
5758055	eng	What comes first?
5758058	eng	We're not saints.
5758059	eng	Tom was helpless.
5758061	eng	We're against it.
5758062	eng	Tom tormented me.
5758064	eng	We remember that.
5758071	eng	Tom stuck around.
5758074	eng	Tom spoke wisely.
5758080	eng	Tom smiled sadly.
5758083	eng	Tom sighed again.
5758086	eng	Tom scored twice.
5758091	eng	They're so right.
5758092	eng	Tom praised Mary.
5758093	eng	They'll kill you.
5758095	eng	Tom noticed Mary.
5758096	eng	They look lovely.
5758098	eng	Tom never sleeps.
5758099	eng	They felt better.
5758100	eng	There were costs.
5758101	eng	Tom loved sports.
5758104	eng	Tom loved horses.
5758107	eng	Tom looks gloomy.
5758109	eng	Raise your glass.
5758110	eng	Tom looked sharp.
5758111	eng	OK, you're wrong.
5758112	eng	OK, you're right.
5758113	eng	Tom looked about.
5758115	eng	OK, thanks again.
5758119	eng	Tom isn't losing.
5758122	eng	Tom isn't Jewish.
5758124	eng	OK, I understand.
5758127	eng	Nobody came here.
5758128	eng	Tom is squatting.
5758133	eng	Name your poison.
5758136	eng	Let's join hands.
5758137	eng	Tom is henpecked.

9152808	eng	We ate caviar.
9152838	eng	We're city girls.
9152896	eng	We burned it.
9152914	eng	I could cry.
9152931	eng	We're smart guys.
9152985	eng	I just sneezed.
9153022	eng	We asked Tom.
9153420	eng	That's Tom's canoe.
9153678	eng	I love rollercoasters.
9153774	eng	He's in Scotland.
9153795	eng	We're lucky men.
9153822	eng	She's in Scotland.
9153905	eng	We hate dogs.
9154115	eng	Is that justification?
9154129	eng	We love soup.
9154157	eng	I'm a shoemaker.
9154161	eng	Tom tripped me.
9154178	eng	We're hard workers.
9154577	eng	We asked why.
9154716	eng	Boys cry too.
9155156	eng	We were sorry.
9155281	eng	We're single parents.
9155322	eng	It's in Scotland.
9155373	eng	Tom confused me.
9155471	eng	We sat still.
9155774	eng	The thunder growled.
9155775	eng	The thunder rumbled.
9155812	eng	I weighed everything.
9155891	eng	I never read.
9155978	eng	They love swimming.
9156564	eng	We were hungry.
9157510	eng	He ignores me.
9157512	eng	He's ignoring me.
9158748	eng	We can't ski.
9158857	eng	We're single mothers.
9158898	eng	Tom adapted quickly.
9158986	eng	We went, too.
9159012	eng	We're dads now.
9159036	eng	We got angry.
9159052	eng	Who fired Tom?
9159056	eng	Tom teaches math.
9159145	eng	We got fined.
9159179	eng	I chose you.
9159369	eng	They're threshing barley.
9159378	eng	Read this question.
9159415	eng	You deceived us.
9159455	eng	This is spam.
9159468	eng	Hide this somewhere.
9159573	eng	Stop bullshitting yourself.
9159796	eng	Say something, man.
9159840	eng	What is freedom?
9159861	eng	Australia is wonderful.
9159903	eng	Explain that, atheists.
9159945	eng	Straighten your spine.
9159986	eng	You're really dumb.
9160199	eng	I love everyone.
9160267	eng	Tom never giggles.
9160302	eng	Is that serious?
9160306	eng	Let's move quickly.
9160738	eng	My soul sings.
9160965	eng	You should confess.
9161072	eng	Try eating it.
9161133	eng	You did wrong.
9161157	eng	Gas has leaked.
9161190	eng	Tom must leave.
9161208	eng	She was sorry.
9161209	eng	He was sorry.
9161295	eng	Who threatened Tom?
9161369	eng	You don't count.
9161648	eng	What's Tom singing?
9161733	eng	Whose is that?
9161857	eng	Finally, we're home.
9161924	eng	You're an idealist.
9161974	eng	Tom listened silently.
9161980	eng	You'll lose anyway.
9161987	eng	Tom's a loner.
9162020	eng	Was Tom conscious?
9162034	eng	May I attend?
9162770	eng	You shouldn't sing.
9163066	eng	Mine is better.
9163098	eng	This is encouraging.
9163113	eng	Age doesn't matter.
9163192	eng	You amaze me.
9163245	eng	We quarreled again.
9163283	eng	We're slow eaters.
9163368	eng	I play bagpipes.
9163570	eng	This is permissible.
9163716	eng	Perhaps he can.
9163717	eng	Perhaps she can.
9163829	eng	Tom played dumb.
9164137	eng	This is sensational.
9164256	eng	Come here immediately!
9164272	eng	I won't chase.
9164410	eng	How's Tom's knee?
9164566	eng	You're a sissy.
9164589	eng	Is it OK?
9164597	eng	Can't you go?
9164673	eng	Obey your elders.
9164822	eng	We upset Tom.
9164876	eng	Press any key.
9164926	eng	Will Tom come?
9165095	eng	You're so graceful.
9165293	eng	You should shower.
9165406	eng	What's a dolphin?
9165515	eng	Stop playing stupid.
9165553	eng	You terrify me.
9165575	eng	Come here immediately.
9165631	eng	Stop. Just stop.
9165632	eng	Tom just landed.
9165685	eng	Food is scarce.
9165708	eng	Tom, you're useless.
9165735	eng	We're Canadian citizens.
9165850	eng	You warned me.
9165878	eng	Tom likes flowers.
9165926	eng	God, that's awful.
9166154	eng	Tom pleaded innocent.
9166422	eng	Sleeping is living.
9166468	eng	Lower the barrier.
9166505	eng	Let me through!
9166506	eng	Congratulations, my friend!
9166520	eng	Where's my sugar?
9166531	eng	Cover your arms.
9166637	eng	Vanessa's calling you.
9166890	eng	Tom likes puns.
9167092	eng	They denounced Tom.
9167213	eng	You're a hero.
9167236	eng	This is usual.
9167250	eng	How's Tom's back?
9167277	eng	Yanni needs medication.
9167284	eng	I was delighted.
9167334	eng	I'm very awkward.
9167391	eng	It's almost here.
9167491	eng	Unleash your creativity!
9167536	eng	Are you stressed?
9167606	eng	You're leaving too?
9167747	eng	You should've known.
9167926	eng	Is he capable?
9169034	eng	Don't be aggressive.
9169458	eng	She is good.
9169486	eng	Solitude is nice.
9169489	eng	Solitude is pleasant.
9169578	eng	Can we apply?
9169877	eng	They grew impatient.
9169899	eng	Emel, come home.
9171146	eng	You're the winner.
9171177	eng	Wash the fruit.
9171207	eng	You'll lose again.
9171235	eng	Let me think!
9171266	eng	That's it, friends.
9171323	eng	We're good listeners.
9171328	eng	I'm a urologist.
9171393	eng	I'm an epidemiologist.
9171407	eng	We may lose.
9171419	eng	You confused me.
9171473	eng	This is alarming.
9171587	eng	What's a spa?
9171621	eng	Let's finish it.
9171728	eng	He appreciated that.
9171758	eng	No one called.
9171763	eng	You behaved rudely.
9171864	eng	I'm an islander.
9171876	eng	You can start.
9171961	eng	Let's drink tea.
9172286	eng	This terrified Tom.
9172307	eng	We're safe drivers.
9172437	eng	I'll manage somehow.
9173459	eng	Let's not quarrel.
9175656	eng	Sami smelled shoes.
9176156	eng	Maybe I'm crazy.
9176196	eng	They deceived Tom.
9176322	eng	What scared Tom?
9176446	eng	I've called everyone.
9176454	eng	Tom loves pansies.
9176529	eng	You're an imbecile.
9176586	eng	Everyone teased Tom.
9176590	eng	I wanna apologize.
9176652	eng	What a storm!
9176659	eng	I'm interested, too.
9176681	eng	Where's the chapel?
9176697	eng	Hit it hard.
9176699	eng	The door's stuck.
9176708	eng	So many stores!
9176712	eng	You seem lively.
9176764	eng	Dine-in or take-out?
9176816	eng	Here's the bathtub.
9176958	eng	How many apples?
9176992	eng	You're all idiots.
9177003	eng	You confused Tom.
9177032	eng	Be an optimist.
9177051	eng	You'll survive me.
9177128	eng	Tom just chuckled.
9177223	eng	Why's Tom grumbling?
9177341	eng	Where's Tom moving?
9177430	eng	How's Tom's elbow?
9177554	eng	Let Tom pass.
9177685	eng	He said "yes".
9177895	eng	Tom wasn't hiding.
9178151	eng	Tom writes novels.
9178210	eng	He's not dangerous.
9178226	eng	Will Tom agree?
9178261	eng	This is scaffolding.
9178296	eng	Sami worshiped God.
9178333	eng	Wear a mask.
9178424	eng	He was circumcised.
9178441	eng	Tom hasn't confessed.
9178539	eng	How was today?
9178570	eng	What's your LINE?
9178620	eng	Tom sighed wearily.
9179355	eng	We'll follow suit.
9179578	eng	Everyone is working.
9179633	eng	It's just us.
9179722	eng	A teaspoon, please.
9179732	eng	We'll rest afterwards.
9179754	eng	There's no more.
9179760	eng	Open the lock.
9179858	eng	This gas stinks.
9179864	eng	Your tummy's growling.
9179908	eng	Tom's not ticklish.
9179916	eng	Mary's a tomboy.
9179942	eng	Are they non-partisan?
9179950	eng	When's Election Day?
9179952	eng	You look unwell.
9179976	eng	Is furigana available?
9180009	eng	That triggers me.
9180082	eng	Relax, nobody's perfect.
9180111	eng	Tom shrugged helplessly.
9180140	eng	Wash the windows.
9180143	eng	Suddenly, Tom stopped.
9180188	eng	Tom is stronger.
9180198	eng	Your feet stink.
9180199	eng	Tom looked pathetic.
9180225	eng	So, what's next?
9180363	eng	Load your pistol.
9180535	eng	We were overtaken.
9180554	eng	You draw well.
9180573	eng	Now, you sing.
9180616	eng	Was Tom warned?
9180665	eng	Open the cage.
9180740	eng	Where's my badge?
9180799	eng	This is transparent.
9180955	eng	Tom made this.
9180972	eng	Are they Canadians?
9181025	eng	This doesn't matter.
9181051	eng	You're all lying.
9181114	eng	Come on, live.
9181168	eng	Let's tickle Tom.
9181381	eng	Come on, breathe!
9181398	eng	It got colder.
9181451	eng	The taxi came.
9181538	eng	This is justice.
9181586	eng	We're taxi drivers.
9181671	eng	We're biology majors.
9181753	eng	Inspiration comes slowly.
9181766	eng	Are you Scottish?
9181911	eng	He's feeling sick.
9182088	eng	He blocked me.
9182109	eng	What terrible weather!
9182111	eng	Such terrible weather!
9182114	eng	What dreadful weather!
9182116	eng	Such dreadful weather!
9182209	eng	Discipline enables freedom.
9182385	eng	Contact my secretary.
9182451	eng	We should stop.
9182661	eng	Don't be silly!
9182810	eng	Tom didn't crash.
9182923	eng	Tom outwitted us.
9183119	eng	Tom surprised us.
9183133	eng	Who needs you?
9183141	eng	This is impressive.
9183194	eng	Even Tom came.
9183200	eng	This is plausible.
9183214	eng	We might win.
9183242	eng	They both lied.
9183280	eng	Tom admonished Mary.
9183288	eng	What's a chimney?
9183303	eng	Change is stressful.
9184004	eng	That terrified Tom.
9184142	eng	You spoiled Tom.
9184821	eng	Where's my eraser?
9184886	eng	I'll probably refuse.
9185231	eng	I'll graduate soon.
9185802	eng	Are you wanted?
9186952	eng	This isn't useless.
9187273	eng	We have kids.
9187603	eng	It's Tom's choice.
9187861	eng	What's a flashlight?
9187900	eng	We're on duty.
9187914	eng	The flowers withered.
9187915	eng	The flowers wilted.
9188161	eng	Let's surprise Tom.
9188170	eng	No one stayed.
9188278	eng	The dog ran.
9188283	eng	I wasn't heard.
9188287	eng	Is she pregnant?
9188292	eng	That's good, though.
9188329	eng	Nobody remembered Tom.
9188357	eng	They married secretly.
9188365	eng	We didn't go.
9188538	eng	We're lonely men.
9188576	eng	What's an auction?
9188625	eng	Rain is needed.
9188753	eng	This won't happen.
9188771	eng	I'm totally exhausted.
9188833	eng	I just checked.
9188894	eng	Is it valid?
9188904	eng	Seriously, you're unbearable.
9188906	eng	Your mouth stinks.
9188938	eng	This is exclusive.
9188946	eng	Temperatures have plummeted.
9188950	eng	Tom wants cheese.
9188959	eng	Children are nuisances.
9189059	eng	Why the delay?
9189063	eng	Politicians are puppets.
9189091	eng	Is he pregnant?
9189096	eng	Tom paints pictures.
9189120	eng	You sit down.
9189121	eng	I sit down.
9189227	eng	She drinks tea.
9189228	eng	She drinks water.
9189384	eng	Tom collects shells.
9189387	eng	These are leather.
9189524	eng	Tom hates peppers.
9189536	eng	It's still leaking.
9189587	eng	It's also cheaper.
9189860	eng	I love broth!
9189884	eng	Trump trumped himself.
9189920	eng	Onesies are comfortable.
9190003	eng	This isn't clean.
9190161	eng	What's the length?
9190330	eng	Time is short.
9190417	eng	This is essential.
9190520	eng	Fold the towel.
9190635	eng	Nobody checked it.
9190728	eng	I warned everyone.
9190733	eng	Tom brought Mary.
9190768	eng	Close the curtains.
9190931	eng	We want proof.
9191331	eng	Women love flowers.
9191638	eng	Coffee has caffeine.
9191837	eng	How's Tom's neck?
9191859	eng	Mom bought apples.
9191903	eng	This is chess.
9191993	eng	They aren't well.
9192040	eng	Beef is expensive.
9192139	eng	This is clear.
9192346	eng	They blew up.
9192353	eng	They got angry.
9192380	eng	My phone's charging.
9192491	eng	I should've noticed.
9192519	eng	It was arson.
9192531	eng	This is unethical.
9192547	eng	Why's it bad?
9192551	eng	Cats like yarn.
9192557	eng	We became comrades.
9192564	eng	Tom shrugged again.
9192588	eng	Tom plays drums.
9192618	eng	This is ineffective.
9192628	eng	Are memes copyrighted?
9192633	eng	Submit or else.
9192635	eng	That was weak.
9192645	eng	We like milk.
9192663	eng	Finally, we're alone.
9192703	eng	Call your mom.
9192736	eng	That mustn't happen.
9192825	eng	Tom lacked confidence.
9192871	eng	It is gone!
9192879	eng	Is one enough?
9192895	eng	Look, there's Tom.
9193017	eng	Is this allowed?
9193037	eng	I wasn't understood.
9193081	eng	What a fool!
9193156	eng	Please don't change.
9193175	eng	Lower the periscope.
9193303	eng	Are they minors?
9193327	eng	Who else knew?
9193336	eng	They met regularly.
9193369	eng	Go catch Tom.
9193444	eng	We're not compatible.
9193449	eng	We aren't boys.
9193485	eng	The cube's frozen.
9193497	eng	What's the context?
9193568	eng	Was Tom invited?
9193750	eng	Go lie down.
9193886	eng	Now you're wrong.
9193987	eng	Aren't you sorry?
9193988	eng	They ignore me.
9194101	eng	Release the dogs.
9194133	eng	Let them pass.
9194161	eng	I was suspended.
9194190	eng	Be careful, please.
9194270	eng	I obeyed reluctantly.
9194404	eng	People don't change.
9194475	eng	I barely escaped.
9194539	eng	Who signed that?
9194555	eng	Playing is healthy.
9194557	eng	They're in training.
9194562	eng	He's so flirty.
9194579	eng	Open the shutter.
9194610	eng	Everybody teased Tom.
9194611	eng	Almost everyone went.
9194652	eng	I always fail.
9194684	eng	They felt uncomfortable.
9194733	eng	We buried it.
9194807	eng	I think yes.
9194920	eng	Are you Canadians?
9194953	eng	Will this help?
9194973	eng	We're restaurant managers.
9194982	eng	That looks difficult.
9194991	eng	Please don't forget.
9195002	eng	Where's my coffee?
9195009	eng	I'm an organist.
9195097	eng	Well, that's fair.
9195111	eng	Aren't you bored?
9195134	eng	Can you row?
9195239	eng	Come early tomorrow.
9195264	eng	Those socks pong.
9195268	eng	Those socks reek.
9195393	eng	Tom never brags.
9195428	eng	Winter is over.
9195477	eng	She's almost sixty.
9195557	eng	Shut your cakehole.
9195565	eng	Shut your piehole.
9195574	eng	Maybe we're crazy.
9195607	eng	Pretty cool, huh?
9195642	eng	I'm a stutterer.
9195736	eng	We're Tom's mentors.
9196381	eng	The rooster crowed.
9196528	eng	We got bored.
9196534	eng	Is France Islamophobic?
9196815	eng	Who noticed that?
9196876	eng	Who's investigating Tom?
9197120	eng	Don't, look there!
9197121	eng	Don't look, there!
9197579	eng	Slow down, please.
9197935	eng	Nobody really cares.
9198214	eng	Eat nutritious food.
9198230	eng	Who'll forbid Tom?
9198277	eng	We may win.
9198450	eng	I'll call Monday.
9198452	eng	Please stay safe.
9198471	eng	They're walking barefoot.
9198614	eng	Your mic's on.
9198629	eng	Your camera's off.
9198673	eng	Be extremely careful.
9198719	eng	Say that again?
9199099	eng	I moved back.
9199129	eng	Can't it wait?
9199151	eng	I'll be downstairs.
9199204	eng	She's an Esperantist.
9199336	eng	I'm not stubborn.
9199348	eng	Wake up, dear.
9199360	eng	Who's behind this?

9392203	eng	He decided quickly.
9392504	eng	We exchanged glances.
9392679	eng	Frankly, I'm surprised.

38947	eng	There's no toilet paper.
38954	eng	I cannot speak German.
38961	eng	Germany borders on France.
38964	eng	Germany adjoins the Netherlands.
38986	eng	Don't open the door.
38990	eng	Keep the door closed.
39008	eng	Please open the door.
39010	eng	Keep the door open.
39026	eng	Knock on the door.
39027	eng	Don't slam the door.
39043	eng	The door remained closed.
39053	eng	The door pushed open.
39056	eng	The door won't close.
39085	eng	She locked the door.
39089	eng	Keep the door locked.
39103	eng	The door is closing.
39108	eng	The door blew shut.
39119	eng	The door opened slowly.
39120	eng	The door burst open.
39121	eng	The door opened automatically.
39122	eng	The door won't open.
39124	eng	The door clicked shut.
39146	eng	Oh, don't watch television.
39148	eng	Turn off the TV.
39157	eng	Let's not watch TV.
39159	eng	Mary likes watching TV.
39162	eng	Watching TV is fun.
39170	eng	I'm just watching TV.
39205	eng	When did TV appear?
39214	eng	Turn up the TV.
39217	eng	Turn down the TV.
39220	eng	Turn down the television.
39237	eng	I'm tired of TV.
39262	eng	The television doesn't work.
39271	eng	The TV doesn't work.
39276	eng	Please answer by telex.
39325	eng	But, I'm going steady.
39330	eng	But you like it!
39340	eng	David is very active.
39346	eng	Who is on duty?
39348	eng	Then let us begin.
39352	eng	See you again tomorrow.
39363	eng	Well, see you later.
39366	eng	We'd better hurry then.
39374	eng	Do you play tennis?
39378	eng	Let's not play tennis.
39390	eng	How about playing tennis?
39418	eng	I have tennis elbow.
39427	eng	I like playing tennis.
39428	eng	Climb to the top.
39449	eng	How was your test?
39483	eng	This weekend, if possible.
39488	eng	I wish I could.
39573	eng	Texas borders on Mexico.
39584	eng	Clear off the table.
39623	eng	It's under the table.
39645	eng	The tape is rolling.
39657	eng	Is this the Taylors'?
39666	eng	I can't find Tim.
39681	eng	Coffee finishes most dinners.
39689	eng	Bring me the Kleenex.
39753	eng	Don't bite your nails.
39774	eng	Don't quarrel over trifles.
39814	eng	Don't buy on credit.
39840	eng	Finally, my father compromised.
39857	eng	At last he yielded.
39875	eng	At last, he came.
39880	eng	He finally made money.
39926	eng	Paul telephoned just now.
39927	eng	I blew a gasket.
39938	eng	You looked at me.
39941	eng	I just dropped in.
39950	eng	That would be difficult.
39953	eng	Oh, he broke wind.
39968	eng	Just a moment, please.
39993	eng	Excuse me a minute.
40017	eng	I'm just looking around.
40019	eng	Let me see it.
40055	eng	I'll take a time-out.
40057	eng	Let's drop the subject.
40062	eng	Just stand there, please.
40069	eng	It's certainly a thrill.
40072	eng	Just turn this handle.
40075	eng	They're a little tight.
40085	eng	May I interrupt you?
40123	eng	It falls on Sunday.
40126	eng	I've just finished lunch.
40131	eng	That hit the spot.
40133	eng	I'm about to leave.
40164	eng	I've just finished packing.
40183	eng	Don't hesitate. Speak out.
40192	eng	Turn to channel 1.
40244	eng	When is checkout time?
40272	eng	Cheese doesn't digest easily.
40281	eng	I'd like some cheese.
40283	eng	How is cheerleading practice?
40286	eng	Where are the tampons?
40300	eng	It was getting dark.
40311	eng	Do you like dancing?
40334	eng	No one encouraged her.
40354	eng	Everyone praises the boy.
40372	eng	Everyone was bustling about.
40377	eng	Everyone is an entrepreneur.
40380	eng	Whose go is it?
40408	eng	Everybody knows the news.
40411	eng	Everyone is not honest.
40421	eng	Who invented the telephone?
40432	eng	Somebody's on the porch!
40438	eng	Who is in fault?
40450	eng	Who painted these pictures?
40452	eng	Who wrote this book?
40454	eng	Who made the doll?
40456	eng	Who made this plan?
40460	eng	Someone entered the room.
40469	eng	Someone is calling you.
40482	eng	Who teaches you French?
40486	eng	Can somebody get that?
40503	eng	Try solving the problem.
40505	eng	No, don't go yet.
40588	eng	It's going to rain.
40599	eng	I've reserved a double.
40615	eng	You must stop smoking.
40635	eng	Smoking does you harm.
40644	eng	Please give up smoking.
40654	eng	You must not smoke.
40673	eng	You should smoke less.
40823	eng	I've just come back.
40826	eng	I was just mugged.
40834	eng	It only costs $10.00!
40845	eng	Just keep on walking.
40856	eng	They are merely different.
40897	eng	Appear before us now.
40898	eng	The line is engaged.
40913	eng	The kite went upward.
40958	eng	Let's take a taxi.
40974	eng	The taxi has arrived.
40984	eng	I want a lot.
41008	eng	Much water is needed.
41051	eng	Many dogs are alive.
41055	eng	You are wrong, however.
41058	eng	So he went in.
41088	eng	However, Bill said "banana."
41092	eng	Shake off the towels.
41103	eng	How about Thai food?
41108	eng	Can I dial directly?
41111	eng	Diamond is essentially hard.
41115	eng	The diamond shone brightly.
41124	eng	The timetable was disrupted.
41125	eng	The tire leaks air.
41133	eng	I'll punch the clock.
41186	eng	Most people think so.
41193	eng	Most girls are kind.
41198	eng	Most students study hard.
41201	eng	Most students like sports.
41207	eng	Most Americans like hamburgers.
41220	eng	It's almost six o'clock.
41229	eng	I'd like a daiquiri.
41237	eng	How's your diet kick?
41283	eng	Don't talk like that.
41312	eng	Don't talk so loud.
41342	eng	Sleep off the problem.
41364	eng	I thought as much.
41365	eng	You know I can't.
41381	eng	Give up such ideas.
41460	eng	You knew it wouldn't.
41461	eng	Don't worry about that.
41462	eng	That's just an excuse.
41478	eng	Don't be so angry.
41486	eng	Don't walk so fast.
41490	eng	Don't run so fast.
41491	eng	Don't speak so fast.
41518	eng	Don't get so excited!
41530	eng	It's not so far.
41534	eng	That makes no difference.
41556	eng	I didn't mean it.
41566	eng	That can't be true.
41574	eng	Don't give me that.
41638	eng	It is absolutely impossible.
41665	eng	That cannot be true.
41705	eng	Let's be going now.
41706	eng	I'm taking off now.
41742	eng	I cannot take less.
41748	eng	Send it by mail.
41752	eng	Just wrap it up.
41754	eng	Let me hear it.
41774	eng	Cut it in half.
41797	eng	Let's make it brief.
41800	eng	Can you prove it?
41810	eng	Prove it by experiment.
41817	eng	Bring it to me.
41832	eng	Send it by airmail.
41839	eng	I left it unlocked.
41848	eng	Let me see that.
41862	eng	Set it down there.
41875	eng	Try and do it.
41908	eng	Do it at once.
41946	eng	They are important matters.
41948	eng	They aren't my books.
41949	eng	They are our cars.
41954	eng	What are they for?
41972	eng	Those books are mine.
42008	eng	Those flowers have died.
42018	eng	I'd rather stay here.
42050	eng	That's my sole concern.
42057	eng	That'll complicate matters more.
42067	eng	It's free of charge.
42068	eng	Your demands are unreasonable.
42070	eng	It came to nothing.
42078	eng	It cannot be true.
42086	eng	It is really wonderful.
42088	eng	It can't be true.
42089	eng	It turned out true.
42090	eng	Can it be true?
42091	eng	I think it's true.
42096	eng	It may be true.
42097	eng	It is a book.
42103	eng	Those are my trousers.
42104	eng	It is on me.
42111	eng	That's against the law.
42114	eng	That is another matter.
42129	eng	That's hard to say.
42170	eng	Ask him about it.
42185	eng	It is still immoral.
42195	eng	Is it Japanese food?
42197	eng	That's a tall order.
42201	eng	It contained harmful chemicals.
42209	eng	It serves you right.
42213	eng	That's beside the point.
42228	eng	That's asking too much.
42231	eng	It's merely a joke.
42235	eng	Whose idea was it?
42239	eng	That's quite a problem.
42249	eng	That is quite possible.
42254	eng	It's an artificial flower.
42259	eng	That's a layman's idea.
42261	eng	That's 3000 yen altogether.
42266	eng	That's quite another thing.
42277	eng	That's not absolutely certain.
42282	eng	It's the front gate.
42284	eng	It won't get anywhere.
42288	eng	It was sublime scenery.
42300	eng	That is all right.
42305	eng	It's a delicate problem.
42306	eng	That requires careful consideration.
42313	eng	That's an excellent wine.
42323	eng	That's news to me.
42325	eng	Is it fine gold?
42351	eng	That's not the case.
42375	eng	It's for my family.
42422	eng	It cannot be helped.
42431	eng	The beginning showed it.
42435	eng	It's an embarrassing question.
42445	eng	Is it not black?
42456	eng	That's putting it mildly.
42466	eng	That goes without saying.
42478	eng	It is no joke.
42479	eng	That will never disappear.
42484	eng	That won't help you.
42497	eng	You can't mistake it.
42504	eng	It happened by accident.
42515	eng	It's a terrible affair.
42517	eng	It happened last October.
42524	eng	It's a worrying matter.
42539	eng	That's stretching the point.
42544	eng	It serves our purpose.
42556	eng	It was ages ago.
42557	eng	What is the story?
42571	eng	That's an incredible story.
42586	eng	I'm afraid you're mistaken.
42588	eng	It was a nightmare.
42590	eng	I made it myself.
42594	eng	It's against the rules.
42600	eng	That's an old trick.
42602	eng	I can't help it.
42604	eng	It's worth a try.
42614	eng	That's one level down.
42627	eng	It's not quite certain.
42642	eng	It makes little difference.
42649	eng	It is Pochi's food.
42655	eng	It fell to pieces.
42658	eng	How long it is!
42662	eng	What animal is it?
42665	eng	It's a trifling incident.
42668	eng	Which theater is that?
42670	eng	Which gate is that?
42674	eng	This sounds very interesting.
42692	eng	Where is it hidden?
42696	eng	I cannot stomach it.
42699	eng	That's a delicate point.
42702	eng	It happened quite recently.
42706	eng	It's sort of strange.
42713	eng	That's just a yarn.
42714	eng	I got it free.
42716	eng	That's quite a story.
42723	eng	That's a splendid idea.
42738	eng	That's a brilliant idea.
42740	eng	That's a great idea.
42741	eng	He cried, "That's good!"
42742	eng	That's a bright idea.
42744	eng	That was some storm.
42752	eng	That's a cheerful remark.
42753	eng	It was like this.
42763	eng	It's just another story.
42781	eng	When does it begin?
42793	eng	It happened one night.
42797	eng	It's a possible story.
42803	eng	It's not worth much.
42820	eng	It begins at six-thirty.
42850	eng	It's my favorite food.
42863	eng	Its color is red.
42872	eng	It has no parallel.
42882	eng	Let's shake on it.
42883	eng	Keep away from that.
42897	eng	Does that include breakfast?
42900	eng	You mustn't touch it.
42907	eng	I didn't notice it.
42979	eng	That's the last straw!
42981	eng	That would be fine.
42998	eng	Well, let's talk turkey.
43003	eng	That's against the contract.
43007	eng	That means sure death!
43045	eng	That would be sufficient.
43101	eng	I do want it.
43105	eng	Let's suppose it's true.
43116	eng	It's my favorite song.
43168	eng	Then she hurried home.
43201	eng	Is this Canadian money?
43211	eng	What does it mean?
43212	eng	Let me try it.
43215	eng	That comes in handy.
43241	eng	It's on the sofa.
43255	eng	Tell me the story.
43269	eng	The story was amusing.
43271	eng	The story sounds true.
43273	eng	The story was true.
43274	eng	The statement sounds improbable.
43289	eng	Let the matter drop.
43306	eng	Both stories are true.
43420	eng	The train was overturned.
43439	eng	The train gained speed.
43464	eng	The dish smells good.
43475	eng	Who planned that trip?
43550	eng	The medicine tastes bitter.
43551	eng	The medicine worked marvels.
43558	eng	The drug acted quickly.
43560	eng	The medicine took effect.
43570	eng	The promise still holds.
43612	eng	That problem was accepted.
43616	eng	I'll reconsider the matter.
43641	eng	The problem remains unsolved.
43644	eng	The problem perplexed him.
43703	eng	Let the problem alone.
43704	eng	The problem defies solution.
43711	eng	The subject is closed.
43746	eng	Let's discuss the problem.
43821	eng	Its name is Ken.
43877	eng	Please read that book.
43899	eng	Give me the book.
43928	eng	Where is the book?
43933	eng	Was the book interesting?
43982	eng	That hat becomes you.
44011	eng	I'm against the bill.
44014	eng	I'm for the bill.
44072	eng	The answer irritated me.
44094	eng	The soldier acted bravely.
44104	eng	The soldier lay dying.
44108	eng	The soldiers turned traitor.
44137	eng	The story concluded abruptly.
44150	eng	The story ends happily.
44167	eng	That suit wears long.
44169	eng	The dress becomes you.
44262	eng	The lady remained silent.
44298	eng	The article is genuine.
44310	eng	That disease is incurable.
44349	eng	The plane crashed suddenly.
44394	eng	The girl is lonely.
44402	eng	Your number doesn't answer.
44446	eng	Take that box away!
44474	eng	What's in the box?
44517	eng	The horse came first.
44531	eng	The farm grows potatoes.
44560	eng	The cat is liked.
44564	eng	The cat drinks milk.
44579	eng	That day shall come.
44614	eng	The meat is frozen.
44615	eng	The meat tastes bad.
44645	eng	The two meetings clash.
44683	eng	The path is broken.
44714	eng	Isn't the answer easy?
44798	eng	The soil retained richness.
44828	eng	The train was crowded.
44849	eng	You have him there.
44871	eng	The store carries earthenware.
44933	eng	The thief ran fast.
45051	eng	That town looked prosperous.
45128	eng	The earthquake smashed everything.
45184	eng	The news gratified us.
45213	eng	The news was sensational.
45240	eng	The news upset me.
45246	eng	The price includes postage.
45248	eng	Does that include everything?
45249	eng	The price includes tax.
45250	eng	The price is reasonable.
45261	eng	The man stood up.
45276	eng	The man ran away.
45301	eng	The man pleaded self-defence.
45316	eng	The man committed murder.
45353	eng	The man finally confessed.
45363	eng	The man lay motionless.
45441	eng	The man, Oedipus, trembled.
45510	eng	Who organized that meeting?
45521	eng	Is it large enough?
45531	eng	Let's play cards instead.
45543	eng	It is otherwise correct.
45587	eng	The statue expresses freedom.
45711	eng	The ship set sail.
45712	eng	They unloaded the ship.
45748	eng	The river is wide.
45760	eng	The river is dangerous.
45786	eng	The teacher grades easily.
45836	eng	The baby is asleep.
45843	eng	The baby is crawling.
45853	eng	The baby fell asleep.
46017	eng	The man was dying.
46025	eng	His name eludes me.
46039	eng	Those people appreciate clarity.
46062	eng	I rejected the offer.
46063	eng	I accept the offer.
46158	eng	The colony declared independence.
46187	eng	This was faulty information.
46229	eng	That joke isn't funny.
46244	eng	Don't sit on it.
46301	eng	The boy ran away.
46318	eng	The boy came running.
46327	eng	The boy is kind.
46357	eng	The boy became happy.
