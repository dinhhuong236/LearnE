1314	eng	You're so impatient with me.
1322	eng	Most people think I'm crazy.
1323	eng	No I'm not; you are!
1327	eng	Then there is a problem...
1333	eng	It depends on the context.
1334	eng	Are you freaking kidding me?!
1348	eng	That's because you're a girl.
1358	eng	One can always find time.
1373	eng	How long did you stay?
1375	eng	Innocence is a beautiful thing.
1387	eng	She's asking how that's possible.
1398	eng	It may freeze next week.
1411	eng	Uh, now it's really weird...
1423	eng	It seems interesting to me.
1435	eng	I don't like you anymore.
1440	eng	But the possibility seems unlikely.
1442	eng	I shouldn't have logged off.

2141	eng	Each person is a world.
2153	eng	Why can't we tickle ourselves?
2161	eng	I want an MP3 player!
2177	eng	I don't necessarily trust translations.
2198	eng	Everyone deserves a second chance.

2314	eng	I've been waiting for hours.
2330	eng	I don't like these remarks.
2332	eng	I'm not convinced at all.
2352	eng	No news is good news.
2358	eng	Wait in the waiting room.
2367	eng	Do you want fruit juice?
2371	eng	There's no love without jealousy.
2384	eng	I can't say the opposite.

40622	eng	Do you mind my smoking?
40640	eng	I long for a smoke.
40641	eng	You'd better give up smoking.
40648	eng	Let me have a cigarette.
40651	eng	Smoking has affected his health.
40652	eng	Tobacco acts on the brain.
40657	eng	Smoking is dangerous to health.
40687	eng	Actually, that's what I thought.
40724	eng	If he fails, so what?
40745	eng	Go through fire and water.

40891	eng	The line is busy now.
40894	eng	We're out of stock now.
40904	eng	I think it's worth asking.
40917	eng	But I never had you.
40945	eng	I'll call you a taxi.
40961	eng	Shall we take a taxi?
40978	eng	The taxi is waiting outside.
40990	eng	You have made many mistakes.
41034	eng	Lots of leftovers remained inside.
41035	eng	There are many tall buildings.
41038	eng	Dozens of students gathered there.
41039	eng	A lot of fish perished.
41064	eng	I tried to tell you.
41065	eng	So we'd better stay home.
41070	eng	So I can make music.
41081	eng	So nobody bothered about me.
41091	eng	The towel counted for nothing.
41101	eng	There are many hotels downtown.
41107	eng	I have to change tires.
41121	eng	I pumped up the tire.

41299	eng	Don't ask such hard questions.
41320	eng	We have no such example.
41326	eng	You must not behave so.
41333	eng	It isn't worthwhile going there.
41343	eng	Such incidents are quite common.
41345	eng	Pardon me for saying so.
41361	eng	Forget about that right now.
41362	eng	Oh, don't worry about that.
41391	eng	Like is hardly the word.
41392	eng	That excuse will not do.
41393	eng	Don't put it that way.
41394	eng	You're making yourself appear cheap.
41402	eng	I don't feel like it.
41408	eng	Don't make such a mistake.
41414	eng	Stop telling those filthy stories.
41459	eng	That's a piece of pie.

41497	eng	Don't make such a noise!
41498	eng	Please don't speak so fast.
41520	eng	Don't hit me so hard.
41541	eng	You shouldn't smoke so much.
41548	eng	Don't eat like a pig.
41570	eng	I can scarcely believe it.
41606	eng	That is beneath ordinary decency.
41627	eng	It's nonsense to try that.
41634	eng	That won't make any difference.
41639	eng	That's a matter of course.
41664	eng	Do you think it likely?
41670	eng	Don't let that happen again!
41672	eng	It's as easy as pie.
41675	eng	Nobody will believe that rumor.
41685	eng	It's about time for dinner.
41707	eng	It's time you faced reality.
41710	eng	We'd better go home now.
41729	eng	Have you been here since?
41735	eng	Have you any further questions?
41750	eng	Please bring it back tomorrow.

41926	eng	Divide it among the three.
41932	eng	I can read them all.
41935	eng	Pack them in the box.
41950	eng	They are my grandfather's books.
41951	eng	These boded you no good.
41952	eng	Those are not your chairs.
41955	eng	What are they made of?
41963	eng	They are very big apples.
41982	eng	These figures don't add up.
41992	eng	Show me the photos, please.
41995	eng	Those children are potential customers.
42010	eng	Those cowards ran away soon.
42011	eng	Please put those chairs away.
42025	eng	That's not a bad idea.
42034	eng	That is a good idea.
42036	eng	It is contrary to reason.
42039	eng	It looks like an egg.
42047	eng	That's very big of you.
42051	eng	That was cooked in oil.
42054	eng	It's out of the question.
42065	eng	It's a bundle of contradictions.
42069	eng	It has resulted in nothing.
42073	eng	It sounds like a dream.
42080	eng	That cannot have been true.
42082	eng	Can it really be mine?
42083	eng	It has to be true.
42085	eng	That's really a great idea.
42092	eng	That might have been true.
42122	eng	It was a partial success.
42128	eng	It was a strange affair.
42133	eng	It is not necessarily so.
42134	eng	It is of great use.
42137	eng	It's a very delicate question.
42141	eng	It's a matter of cost.
42156	eng	Does it bark at her?
42163	eng	That shows his theoretical background.
42164	eng	It is to his advantage.
42166	eng	It runs against his character.
42177	eng	That applies to him too.
42198	eng	It is a difficult problem.
42199	eng	It isn't hard to do.
42200	eng	I found the book easy.
42202	eng	It's neither good nor bad.
42205	eng	It is a moral question.
42210	eng	It is smaller than Tokyo.
42219	eng	Is it a direct flight?
42224	eng	It was a long letter.
42227	eng	Does that price include breakfast?
42232	eng	It was simply an oversight.
42236	eng	It's the same for everyone.
42237	eng	Anyone can do it easily.
42241	eng	It is of great value.
42243	eng	It makes all the difference.
42251	eng	It may well be true.
42269	eng	That's a completely unfounded rumor.
42270	eng	That's an unusual thing, undoubtedly.
42271	eng	That's quite to my taste.
42274	eng	That is not altogether false.
42279	eng	It was shortened with advantage.
42281	eng	What exactly does that mean?
42290	eng	It is founded on supposition.
42297	eng	That is not the case.
42299	eng	It really hit the spot.
42309	eng	It is best left untouched.
42311	eng	It is merely an ornament.
42318	eng	That didn't help them any.
42330	eng	It needs to be repaired.
42334	eng	That will benefit the community.
42335	eng	That will contribute to society.
42336	eng	It is just an act.
42338	eng	That is an actual fact.
42348	eng	It's a waste of time.
42354	eng	It gave me the creeps.
42355	eng	It is abhorrent to me.
42359	eng	That is not my line.
42363	eng	It's in my jacket pocket.
42364	eng	That goes against my beliefs.
42365	eng	It is beyond my power.
42366	eng	That runs against my principles.
42370	eng	It's for my personal use.
42373	eng	That is in my recollections.
42376	eng	That is my own affair.
42377	eng	Is it anything like mine?
42382	eng	It's none of my business!
42386	eng	It is nothing to me.
42390	eng	It's too difficult for me.
42392	eng	It's all one to me.
42393	eng	That's good news to me.
42421	eng	It is a childish act.
42423	eng	It is only too true.
42443	eng	It has become quite common.
42454	eng	That is going too far.
42461	eng	Won't it keep until later?
42467	eng	It is saying too much.
42471	eng	It is horrible to see.
42477	eng	It is anything but big.
42489	eng	It is just your imagination.
42491	eng	It rests on your decision.
42493	eng	It is up to you.
42494	eng	Is it near your house?
42502	eng	It was a chance meeting.
42503	eng	It was a casual meeting.
42512	eng	They are the extreme cases.

1110345	eng	I'm relieved to hear that.
1110423	eng	You are abusing your authority.
1110432	eng	I'm here to save you.
1110467	eng	You go on without me.
1110473	eng	I don't need a lecture.
1110477	eng	You look just like him.
1110486	eng	We'll talk about it later.
1110488	eng	I'll be a good girl.
1110496	eng	To whom it may concern:
1110502	eng	Did you just realize that?
1110514	eng	You may not pass, sir.
1110669	eng	I'm getting a bad feeling.
1111464	eng	I can't see him either.
1111522	eng	He won't leave us alone.
1111553	eng	Been a while, hasn't it?
1111563	eng	You're sure there's no way?
1111582	eng	I'll keep my mouth shut.
1111587	eng	She's completely crazy about him.
1111601	eng	That won't be a problem.
1111602	eng	I've taken care of it.
1111614	eng	I thought he was here.

1112158	eng	What is wrong with him?
1112159	eng	What is wrong with her?
1112163	eng	Things are not that simple.

1887386	eng	I have work to do.
1887389	eng	I haven't had much sleep.
1887395	eng	I hear you're moving out.
1887401	eng	I heard about your problems.
1887402	eng	I heard it on TV.
1887408	eng	I heard you switched majors.
1887413	eng	I hope that's not true.
1887415	eng	I hope Tom is OK.
1887416	eng	I hope Tom says no.
1887417	eng	I hope Tom says yes.
1887418	eng	I hope we find Tom.
1887419	eng	I hope you don't mind.
1887427	eng	I just couldn't help myself.
1887428	eng	I just couldn't say no.
1887429	eng	I just didn't believe Tom.
1887433	eng	I just feel like relaxing.
1887437	eng	I just got your email.
1887438	eng	I just made three grand.
1887441	eng	I just need a minute.
1887447	eng	I just saw the news.
1887448	eng	I just stubbed my toe.
1887450	eng	I just want to rest.
1887451	eng	I just want to talk.
1887462	eng	I keep thinking about Tom.
1887464	eng	I knew I wasn't crazy.
1887466	eng	I knew what you meant.
1887468	eng	I knew you'd be mad.
1887473	eng	I knew you'd like it.
1887480	eng	I know all about you.
1887484	eng	I know how this works.
1887491	eng	I know something you don't.
1887502	eng	I know this is hard.
1887506	eng	I know what I said.
1887507	eng	I know what I want.
1887510	eng	I know what killed Tom.
1887511	eng	I know what Tom wants.
1887512	eng	I know what you're doing.
1887513	eng	I know what you're thinking.
1887518	eng	I know who did it.
1887525	eng	I know you feel bad.
1887530	eng	I left you a message.
1887534	eng	I like how Tom thinks.
1887536	eng	I like to be prepared.
1887544	eng	I locked the front door.
1887546	eng	I lost track of time.
1887549	eng	I love Mary so much.
1887562	eng	I made a few changes.
1887570	eng	I might talk to Tom.
1887571	eng	I miss Tom so much.
1887573	eng	I need a few minutes.
1887579	eng	I need the car keys.
1887586	eng	I need to see Tom.
1887594	eng	You should have seen me.
1887605	eng	I never went to sleep.
1887607	eng	I owe you an explanation.
1887619	eng	I really appreciate your offer.
1887629	eng	I really need your help.
1887644	eng	I saw what Tom did.
1887645	eng	I saw what you did.
1887653	eng	I see Tom every day.
1887657	eng	I should get back home.
1887662	eng	I should get some rest.
1887665	eng	I should've listened to you.
1887666	eng	I should've never come here.
1887670	eng	I shouldn't have gone there.
1887672	eng	I slept through the storm.
1887689	eng	I still don't like it.
1887692	eng	I stole it from Tom.
1887693	eng	I stretched out my arms.
1887694	eng	I stretched out my legs.
1887705	eng	I think I like you.
1887708	eng	I think I'm in love.
1887722	eng	I think Mary likes me.
1887736	eng	I think Tom is lying.
1887749	eng	I think we got it.
1887767	eng	I think we should go.
1887794	eng	I think you'd better go.
1887797	eng	I think you're too picky.
1887805	eng	I thought it was good.
1887809	eng	I thought you had homework.
1887811	eng	I thought you needed money.
1887836	eng	I told Tom the truth.
1887840	eng	I told Tom what happened.
1887854	eng	I told you to leave.
1887863	eng	I tried to warn you.
1887867	eng	I understood what you meant.
1887869	eng	I waited for a reply.
1887875	eng	I want it to happen.
1887876	eng	I want my desk back.
1887877	eng	I want my dictionary back.
1887878	eng	I want my girlfriend back.
1887881	eng	I want my phone back.
1887884	eng	I want to be here.
1887887	eng	I want to believe you.
1887888	eng	I want to come home.
1887891	eng	I want to go back.
1887893	eng	I want to meet Tom.
1887894	eng	I want to see Tom.
1887906	eng	I wanted to go home.
1887909	eng	I wanted to say no.
1887910	eng	I wanted to say yes.
1887915	eng	I was afraid of that.
1887923	eng	I was in a hurry.
1887924	eng	I was in all day.
1887926	eng	I was in the area.
1887934	eng	I was on the list.
1887937	eng	I was taking a bath.
1887945	eng	I was up all night.
1887947	eng	I was your age once.
1887948	eng	I wasn't drinking last night.
1887955	eng	I went to a concert.
1887956	eng	I went to school here.
1887957	eng	I went to see Tom.
1887970	eng	I wish that were true.
1887979	eng	I won't get a raise.
1887985	eng	I won't work with him.
1888296	eng	I want a new car.
1888384	eng	I wish I could help.
1888391	eng	I wish I had more.
1888399	eng	I wish you'd come sooner.
1888573	eng	Tom is reading the Bible.
1888923	eng	The party ended at nine.
1889727	eng	"Tom, hurry up." "I'm coming!"
1890699	eng	Were you looking at her?
1890700	eng	Were you looking at him?
1890701	eng	Do you think she's pretty?
1890702	eng	Do you think he's pretty?
1890703	eng	Is he having an affair?
1890704	eng	Is she having an affair?
1890706	eng	Are you having an affair?
1890710	eng	It's worse than you think.
1890711	eng	She's now a college student.
1890712	eng	He's now a college student.
1890728	eng	I love being around him.
1890729	eng	I love being around her.
1890735	eng	She doesn't seem to care.
1890736	eng	He doesn't seem to care.
1890745	eng	I'm not breaking the law.
1890746	eng	He's not breaking the law.
1890747	eng	She's not breaking the law.
1890748	eng	Prostitution is legal in Germany.
1890841	eng	I'd better call you back.
1890847	eng	I'd like to believe you.
1890849	eng	I'd like to see Tom.
1890857	eng	I'd recommend taking a break.
1890868	eng	I'll be going with you.
1890870	eng	I'll be in my office.
1890871	eng	I'll be in the truck.
1890880	eng	I'll call you a cab.
1890882	eng	I'll come and get you.
1890884	eng	I'll come back for you.
1890886	eng	I'll come in early tomorrow.
1890888	eng	I'll do better next time.
1890890	eng	I'll do what I can.
1890900	eng	I'll get right on it.
1890905	eng	I'll get you a towel.
1890919	eng	I'll make a few calls.
1890925	eng	I'll pay my own way.
1890935	eng	I'll take it to Tom.
1890939	eng	I'll take you to Tom.
1890946	eng	I'll walk out with you.
1890959	eng	I'm afraid I don't understand.
1890986	eng	I'm going to be sick.
1890987	eng	I'm going to call Tom.
1890988	eng	I'm going to go now.
1890990	eng	I'm going to miss Tom.
1891003	eng	I'm here to help you.
1891006	eng	I'm just a taxi driver.
1891019	eng	I'm kind of a loner.
1891026	eng	I'm moving back to Boston.
1891032	eng	I'm not afraid of Tom.
1891033	eng	I'm not afraid of you.
1891042	eng	I'm not going to die.
1891051	eng	I'm not home right now.
1891056	eng	I'm not on anybody's side.
1891057	eng	I'm not one to gossip.
1891075	eng	I'm not telling you anything.
1891092	eng	I'm not your husband anymore.
1891093	eng	I'm old enough to drink.
1891094	eng	I'm old enough to drive.
1891095	eng	I'm old enough to vote.
1891100	eng	I'm only trying to help.
1891103	eng	I'm pretty sure about that.
1891120	eng	I'm sick of your complaints.
1891124	eng	I'm so glad you called.
1891126	eng	I'm so proud of you.
1891133	eng	I'm sure I'll be fine.
1891135	eng	I'm sure Tom is bored.
1891145	eng	I'm taking a week off.
1891149	eng	I'm tired of playing games.
1891152	eng	I'm tougher than you think.
1891153	eng	I'm trying to help you.
1891155	eng	I'm trying to reach Tom.
1891159	eng	I'm wide open for suggestions.
1891165	eng	I've already seen that movie.
1891170	eng	I've been here for hours.
1891171	eng	I've been so busy recently.
1891178	eng	I've got a better idea.
1891181	eng	I've got news for you.
1891187	eng	I've had a busy day.
1891188	eng	I've had a busy morning.
1891189	eng	I've had a busy week.
1891190	eng	I've had a horrible day.
1891191	eng	I've heard this song before.
1891192	eng	I've just finished eating breakfast.
1891195	eng	I've met people like that.
1891201	eng	I've taken care of everything.
1891234	eng	He has an intriguing personality.
1891264	eng	What's the secret to success?
1892199	eng	Peter is a truthful man.
1892429	eng	Is somebody teaching you French?
1892791	eng	Please give me an envelope.
1892798	eng	Please continue with your story.
1893271	eng	Come tomorrow to see me.
1893280	eng	Don't try that at home.
1893286	eng	He spoke for one hour.
1893595	eng	We've never been formally introduced.
1893597	eng	We've had this conversation before.
1893598	eng	We've got a problem here.
1893601	eng	We've been looking for you.
1893602	eng	We've already talked about this.
1893614	eng	We're still looking for Tom.
1893619	eng	We're ready when you are.
1893623	eng	We're paid by the hour.
1893633	eng	We're not home right now.
1893665	eng	We'll do everything we can.
1893708	eng	We tried to save Tom.
1893720	eng	We shouldn't have gone there.
1893721	eng	We shouldn't have done this.
1893722	eng	We shouldn't have done that.
1893724	eng	We should've gone there ourselves.
1893725	eng	We should've done that ourselves.
1893726	eng	We should set a trap.
1893728	eng	We should run some tests.
1893729	eng	We should probably go home.
1893736	eng	We should cut our losses.
1893741	eng	We need you to baby-sit.
1893745	eng	We need to protect Tom.
1893748	eng	We need to help Tom.
1893753	eng	We need to get going.
1893757	eng	We need to call someone.
1893769	eng	We must do it again.
1893783	eng	We know what we're doing.
1893786	eng	We just need a plan.
1893792	eng	We just fed the baby.
1893793	eng	We just couldn't help ourselves.
1893803	eng	We have work to do.
1893809	eng	We have to save Tom.
1893811	eng	We have to leave now.
1893815	eng	We have to help Tom.
1893816	eng	We have to go now.
1893819	eng	We have to fix this.
1893820	eng	We have to find Tom.
1893832	eng	We have to do better.
1893835	eng	We have things to do.
1893840	eng	We have medicine for you.
1893845	eng	We have business to discuss.
1893847	eng	We have a new problem.
1893860	eng	We fight all the time.
1893865	eng	We don't need your help.
1893883	eng	We don't have much time.
1893886	eng	We don't have any secrets.
1893896	eng	We do have other choices.
1893900	eng	We did all we could.
1893901	eng	We couldn't see a thing.
1893907	eng	We come here every day.
1893908	eng	We can't sell that bracelet.
1893910	eng	We can't protect Tom indefinitely.
1893911	eng	We can't live like this.
1893914	eng	We can't just walk away.
1893916	eng	We can't just ignore this.
1893917	eng	We can't just give up.
1893919	eng	We can't do this anymore.
1893923	eng	We can't change the past.
1894125	eng	The room erupted in laughter.
1894130	eng	You will pay for this!
1894131	eng	He will pay for this.
1894132	eng	She will pay for this.
1894143	eng	She has a dark secret.
1894144	eng	He has a dark secret.
1894191	eng	He is always neatly dressed.
1894198	eng	He wore a morning coat.
1894218	eng	We're going the wrong way.
1894257	eng	She runs a dance studio.
1894261	eng	He is intelligent and passionate.
1894288	eng	It feels like a dream.
1894295	eng	This is the right answer.
1894344	eng	I'll just leave this here.
1894348	eng	This is where she lives.
1894349	eng	This is where he lives.
1894386	eng	He plays World of Warcraft.
1894387	eng	She plays World of Warcraft.
1894391	eng	Thank you for your love.
1894433	eng	She was my only joy.
1894434	eng	He was my only joy.
1894443	eng	You will always be there.
1894445	eng	She will always be there.
1894447	eng	He will always be there.
1894529	eng	Let's split up into teams.
1894540	eng	Let's go to my office.
1894544	eng	Let's get ready to go.
1894598	eng	It's been a hard year.
1895544	eng	You've made a huge mistake.
1895546	eng	You've got to stop, Tom.
1895547	eng	You've got to stop Tom.
1895548	eng	You've got to help me.
1895553	eng	You've both been very helpful.
1895569	eng	You're so good at singing.
1895573	eng	You're smarter than Tom is.
1895575	eng	You're smarter than I am.
1895590	eng	You're not looking so hot.
1895598	eng	You're lucky Tom helped you.
1895600	eng	You're lucky Tom didn't come.
1895613	eng	You're going to like Tom.
1895625	eng	You're braver than I am.
1895630	eng	You're acting like a child.
1895631	eng	You're acting like a baby.
1895641	eng	You'd better hand that over.
1895642	eng	You won't remember a thing.
1895644	eng	You won't find anything here.
1895645	eng	You won't be needing that.
1895649	eng	You told me that before.
1895660	eng	You shouldn't have come back.
1895661	eng	You shouldn't have come alone.
1895662	eng	You shouldn't have any problems.
1895663	eng	You shouldn't be in here.
1895664	eng	You shouldn't be doing that.
1895666	eng	You should've listened to me.
1895670	eng	You should wash your hands.
1895671	eng	You should wash your hair.
1895672	eng	You should wash your face.
1895673	eng	You should wash your car.
1895675	eng	You should see Tom's picture.
1895697	eng	You owe me an explanation.
1895698	eng	You ought to trust me.
1895699	eng	You never know who's watching.
1895705	eng	You must face your fears.
1895706	eng	You must be Tom's mother.
1895721	eng	You lied to me again.
1895723	eng	You know where Tom is.
1895724	eng	You know what Tom wants.
1895725	eng	You know what I want.
1895730	eng	You just don't get it.
1895731	eng	You haven't done anything wrong.
1895733	eng	You have to leave Boston.
1895735	eng	You have to help me.
1895736	eng	You have to go home.
1895739	eng	You have to call Tom.
1895742	eng	You have taught him well.
1895743	eng	You have plenty of time.
1895751	eng	You have a secret admirer.
1895752	eng	You guys have to hurry.
1895753	eng	You guys are no fun.
1895758	eng	You don't really know me.
1895759	eng	You don't owe me anything.
1895763	eng	You don't look so good.
1895774	eng	You don't have a choice.
1895778	eng	You didn't let me finish.
1895781	eng	You did all you could.
1895784	eng	You could have been happy.
1895798	eng	You can't come in here.
1895804	eng	You can tell Tom yourself.
1895812	eng	You can come with us.
1895813	eng	You can call me Tom.
1895815	eng	You can always come here.
1895821	eng	You are such a liar.
1897655	eng	It can't possibly be true.
1897687	eng	If you'd listen, you'd understand.
1897689	eng	It could be big trouble.
1897701	eng	It is kind of pretty.
1897719	eng	It may take a while.
1897725	eng	It was a simple matter.
1897726	eng	It was all my fault.
1897736	eng	It was worth a try.
1897755	eng	That isn't what I meant.
1897766	eng	That was a big surprise.
1897781	eng	That's an even better idea.
1897797	eng	That's not all Tom said.
1897801	eng	That's not going to help.
1897804	eng	That's not in the file.
1897810	eng	That's not what I want.
1897811	eng	That's not what I'm saying.
1897812	eng	That's not what Tom meant.
1897825	eng	That's what friends are for.
1897848	eng	You have to be strong.
1897850	eng	I expected better of you.
1897851	eng	I expected better of him.
1897852	eng	I expected better of her.
1897862	eng	How does he know that?
1897863	eng	How does she know that?
1897872	eng	He wants to be different.
1897873	eng	She wants to be different.
1898029	eng	What Tom did was hilarious.
1898030	eng	What Tom did was awful.
1898063	eng	This was all a mistake.
1898082	eng	This is your last chance.
1898099	eng	This is not a game.
1898111	eng	This is all our fault.
1898113	eng	This is a nice place.
1898120	eng	They've had plenty of time.
1898130	eng	They're all scared of Tom.
1898131	eng	They'll take care of Tom.
1898132	eng	They won't tell us anything.
1898137	eng	They never did an autopsy.
1898177	eng	There must be some mistake.

2396229	eng	It didn't happen that way.
2396240	eng	It feels weird, doesn't it?
2396251	eng	It was never like that.
2396266	eng	It's what we always planned.
2396269	eng	Just don't get involved, OK?
2396270	eng	Just don't tell anyone, OK?

2396286	eng	May I be of assistance?
2396288	eng	May I be of service?
2396290	eng	May I borrow your lighter?
2396293	eng	Maybe we should keep looking.
2396298	eng	Nobody else has a chance.
2396299	eng	Nobody encouraged Tom to study.
2396301	eng	Nobody knows it but me.
2396302	eng	Now don't be hasty, please.
2396303	eng	Now don't freak out, OK?
2396304	eng	Now don't start crying, Tom.

2510964	eng	I hope he doesn't die.
2511140	eng	Tom almost never calls Mary.
2511821	eng	This isn't going to work.
2511831	eng	We were a perfect couple.
2511842	eng	I haven't finished my lunch.
2512850	eng	They differ in many respects.
2512852	eng	They're always deep in debt.
2513105	eng	Is it good or not?
2513121	eng	The thief smashed the window.
2513233	eng	Your car is being towed.
2513533	eng	Last night was really awesome.
2513605	eng	I run ten kilometers daily.
2514021	eng	Tom is considering several possibilities.
2514101	eng	Think of the starving children.
2514102	eng	You have to eat everything!
2514116	eng	Do you miss your friends?
2514133	eng	All I ate was bananas.
2514141	eng	This is a quiet street.
2514494	eng	She found what she wanted.
2514517	eng	She passes the time moaning.
2514899	eng	Queens is my favorite borough.
2515175	eng	I can't leave off smoking.
2515224	eng	He made a sand sculpture.
2515232	eng	He has clear blue eyes.
2515287	eng	They did not believe me.
2515288	eng	I felt attracted to him.
2515289	eng	I felt attracted to her.
2515292	eng	This man is good looking.
2515294	eng	She's good-looking for her age.
2515302	eng	They split the bill evenly.
2515304	eng	It wasn't all that great.
2515322	eng	You have much to learn.
2515686	eng	Leave it in my hands.
2515713	eng	Nothing is heard about him.
2515730	eng	Please take note of that.
2516069	eng	Don't you trust your instincts?
2516083	eng	Spencer's attitude drives me nuts.
2516412	eng	I'd like some ice cream.
2516430	eng	I hate cold winter days.
2517115	eng	I am your older sister.
2517117	eng	I am your elder sister.
2517176	eng	That's what makes me happy.
2517266	eng	Have we met somewhere before?
2517274	eng	Squirrels can run really quickly.
2517279	eng	My dog likes chasing squirrels.
2517676	eng	Not all laws are just.
2517748	eng	I know him quite well.
2517761	eng	She plays poker with them.
2517775	eng	He has problems at school.
2518217	eng	I'll loan you my dictionary.
2518317	eng	She has problems at school.
2518331	eng	I know her quite well.
2518376	eng	We dined at a restaurant.
2518556	eng	She wants to be popular.
2518562	eng	She didn't believe the rumor.
2518563	eng	He didn't believe the rumor.
2519929	eng	I need a writing pad.
2520112	eng	The tea is really delicious.
2520167	eng	Sorry about the last time.
2520216	eng	I had the same version.
2520227	eng	What did I just watch?
2520301	eng	The T-shirt costs ten euros.
2520311	eng	Never mind that right now.
2520313	eng	I hope she is okay.
2520315	eng	They went to Disney World.
2521139	eng	I'm going to Nîmes tomorrow.
2521843	eng	No action today, is there?
2522530	eng	I would do the same.
2522618	eng	Usually, Americans prefer big cars.
2522623	eng	Do you have mobile phones?
2522624	eng	Does your sister have children?
2523424	eng	I get everything I want.
2523744	eng	So there is a problem...
2523824	eng	John's older than I thought.
2523846	eng	That bed is very comfortable.
2523860	eng	I will write a letter.
2523931	eng	He worked the whole night.
2523935	eng	People should love each other.
2524364	eng	You should write a book!
2524378	eng	This is going too far.
2524568	eng	We're in summer, not winter.
2525107	eng	Quit finding fault with me!
2525130	eng	Give me all the money.
2525160	eng	Please give me this money.
2525221	eng	Don't confuse Chinese with Japanese.
2525230	eng	It seems he knows Ann.
2525295	eng	She gets paid a lot.
2526220	eng	She doesn't like this game.
2526222	eng	She didn't like this game.
2526223	eng	The conversation lasted beyond midnight.
2526358	eng	How old is your grandmother?
2527268	eng	He is good and coherent.
2528426	eng	It is what it is.
2528441	eng	Tom woke up at 6:30.
2528442	eng	Tom got up at 7:00.
2528451	eng	I will go to Athens.
2528468	eng	I ate the red apples.
2528472	eng	I ate the green apples.
2528509	eng	How come you didn't come?
2529716	eng	We learn much from experience.
2529723	eng	One hour until the event.
2530211	eng	He treats me with severity.
2530615	eng	We're looking for more volunteers.
2531344	eng	Thanks for volunteering to help.
2531347	eng	No one wants to volunteer.
2531349	eng	We're looking for a volunteer.
2531350	eng	I was hoping you'd volunteer.
2531376	eng	Tom is a volunteer fireman.
2531583	eng	You can't always avoid problems.
2533419	eng	How could I hate Tom?
2534274	eng	What a waste of time!
2534586	eng	I hope that doesn't happen.
2534598	eng	She's a very beautiful girl.
2534603	eng	What's that little blinking light?
2534606	eng	My connection has sporadic problems.
2534694	eng	Thinking too much is bad.
2534752	eng	You think too much too.
2534821	eng	What helps you sleep better?
2534830	eng	I feel like an amoeba.
2534862	eng	What a disappointment you are!
2534999	eng	A promise is a debt.
2535071	eng	What's that in your hand?
2535240	eng	He was sent to Guantanamo.
2535408	eng	Greece has a great history.
2535411	eng	Emily is afraid of heights.
2535414	eng	Emily is my best friend.
2535416	eng	People are urinating in public.
2536003	eng	Don't criticize him in public.
2538617	eng	Tom withheld some important information.
2538654	eng	Tom complained about the accommodations.
2539120	eng	Tom avoided answering Mary's question.
2539223	eng	I'll personally guarantee your safety.
2539462	eng	I'm not discounting that possibility.
2539471	eng	I'm having trouble understanding you.
2539603	eng	You're under arrest for trespassing.
2539626	eng	We drank cappuccinos and reminisced.
2539751	eng	I'm not feeling particularly hungry.
2539752	eng	I'm not expecting special treatment.
2539753	eng	I'm not carrying any identification.
2539910	eng	Are you recording this conversation?
2539911	eng	You've probably forgotten about it.
2539960	eng	Tom skipped breakfast this morning.
2539998	eng	Tom enjoyed reading Mary's letters.
2540002	eng	Tom couldn't walk without crutches.
2540177	eng	I'd recognize Tom's voice anywhere.
2540309	eng	You're very confident, aren't you?
2540340	eng	We're sorry for any inconvenience.
2540342	eng	We'll be there tomorrow afternoon.
2540369	eng	Tom sounded a little disappointed.
2540370	eng	Tom smiled at Mary affectionately.
2540387	eng	Tom is Mary's long-time boyfriend.
2540420	eng	Tom apparently can't speak French.
2540450	eng	I'm surprised you weren't invited.
2540465	eng	I'm suggesting it's a possibility.
2540468	eng	I'm still your commanding officer.
2540512	eng	I'm just following the blueprints.
2540537	eng	I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.
2540544	eng	I'm feeling embarrassed right now.
2540548	eng	I'm aware you've already finished.
2540654	eng	I understand why you're concerned.
2540725	eng	You wouldn't have recognized Tom.
2540727	eng	You should've brushed your teeth.
2540743	eng	What's your mother's maiden name?
2540749	eng	We should've gotten here earlier.
2540757	eng	Tom would've loved the concert.
2540768	eng	Tom withheld information from us.
2540774	eng	Tom was mopping the kitchen.
2540787	eng	Tom skateboarded down the street.
2540794	eng	Tom rides his bicycle everywhere.
2540822	eng	Tom eats breakfast every morning.
2540829	eng	Tom bought three lottery tickets.
2540850	eng	I'm worried about Tom's behavior.
2540854	eng	I'm very uncomfortable with this.
2540880	eng	I'm sure that wasn't intentional.
2540893	eng	I'm severely allergic to peanuts.
2540894	eng	I'm responsible for Tom's safety.
2540932	eng	I'm just saying it's complicated.
2540935	eng	I'm happy we're working together.
2540972	eng	I'm convinced Tom killed himself.
2540974	eng	I'm aware of my responsibilities.
2540979	eng	I'm afraid that's not acceptable.
2541003	eng	I'll handle all the arrangements.
2541105	eng	I thought Tom was crazy.
2541131	eng	You've still got thirty minutes.
2541132	eng	You've stalled long enough, Tom.
2541133	eng	You've skipped too many classes.
2541145	eng	You would've seen it eventually.
2541150	eng	You shouldn't play with matches.
2541164	eng	We'll worry about that tomorrow.
2541171	eng	We have Tom's signed confession.
2541190	eng	Tom was kidnapped by terrorists.
2541197	eng	Tom took a fifteen-minute break.
2541205	eng	Tom started scrubbing the floor.
2541219	eng	Tom probably won't eat anything.
2541220	eng	Tom opened the medicine cabinet.
2541221	eng	Tom offered Mary a handkerchief.
2541223	eng	Tom mumbled something in French.
2541238	eng	Tom is a bleeding-heart liberal.
2541247	eng	Tom disagreed with the decision.
2541250	eng	Tom checked the rearview mirror.
2541264	eng	Tom apparently doesn't eat meat.
2541269	eng	They wouldn't take me seriously.
2541271	eng	The restaurant was almost empty.
2541273	eng	That was interesting, wasn't it?
2541274	eng	That strike lasted three months.
2541281	eng	I've been getting death threats.
2541300	eng	I'm surprised you're still here.
2541301	eng	I'm surprised you overlooked it.
2541315	eng	I'm sure everything's just fine.
2541316	eng	I'm still not thinking straight.
2541324	eng	I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
2541330	eng	I'm on the nominating committee.
2541358	eng	I'm just following Tom's orders.
2541360	eng	I'm intrigued by your challenge.
2541363	eng	I'm having trouble believing it.
2541399	eng	I'm free for breakfast tomorrow.
2541403	eng	I'm concerned with Tom's safety.
2541404	eng	I'm concerned about your future.
2541405	eng	I'm checking out this afternoon.
2541409	eng	I'm beginning to understand why.
2541418	eng	I'm afraid that wasn't possible.
2541442	eng	I'll never forget what happened.
2541474	eng	I wouldn't recommend doing that.
2541502	eng	I wasn't asking your permission.
2541565	eng	I haven't eaten since breakfast.
2541590	eng	You're very strong, aren't you?
2541591	eng	You're very good with children.
2541593	eng	You're shivering. Are you cold?
2541595	eng	You're not getting any younger.
2541605	eng	You should've stayed in Boston.
2541622	eng	What's your wife's maiden name?
2541625	eng	We're not doing anything wrong.
2541628	eng	We should've gotten up earlier.
2541631	eng	Tom wrote about his experience.
2541632	eng	Tom wouldn't accept my apology.
2541641	eng	Tom won three thousand dollars.
2541658	eng	Tom switched on the microphone.
2541659	eng	Tom suspected Mary was kidding.
2541660	eng	Tom stumbled and fell backward.
2541664	eng	Tom scrubbed the kitchen floor.
2541677	eng	Tom opened the kitchen cabinet.
2541681	eng	Tom looked through the drawers.
2541682	eng	Tom looked in the refrigerator.
2541683	eng	Tom listened to Mary patiently.
2541694	eng	Tom isn't asking any questions.
2541706	eng	Tom handed Mary the binoculars.
2541716	eng	Tom didn't feel the earthquake.
2541718	eng	Tom declined to be interviewed.
2541720	eng	Tom closed the venetian blinds.
2541735	eng	Tom and Mary exchanged glances.
2541738	eng	This house has three bathrooms.
2541739	eng	They wouldn't refund my ticket.
2541741	eng	The police are questioning Tom.
2541744	eng	The Jacksons are our neighbors.
2541746	eng	The classroom was almost empty.
2541759	eng	I'm watching the football game.
2541761	eng	I'm waiting for an explanation.
2541808	eng	I'm slightly worried about Tom.
2541809	eng	I'm seriously annoyed with Tom.
2541816	eng	I'm prepared for any situation.
2541817	eng	I'm pleased you still remember.
2541821	eng	I'm not your assistant anymore.
2541822	eng	I'm not worried about anything.
2541823	eng	I'm not throwing anything away.
2541834	eng	I'm not sure anything happened.
2541835	eng	I'm not saying it's impossible.
2541836	eng	I'm not really that interested.
2541840	eng	I'm not interested in politics.
2541841	eng	I'm not having second thoughts.
2541853	eng	I'm not comfortable doing this.
2541854	eng	I'm not certain about anything.
2541855	eng	I'm not asking your permission.
2541865	eng	I'm just sitting here thinking.
2541866	eng	I'm just sitting here relaxing.
2541867	eng	I'm just an innocent bystander.
2541875	eng	I'm having trouble standing up.
2541906	eng	I'm glad you're feeling better.
2541913	eng	I'm glad everything worked out.
2541914	eng	I'm getting married in October.
2541918	eng	I'm concerned for Tom's safety.
2541919	eng	I'm certainly glad you're here.
2541923	eng	I'm beginning to lose patience.
2541925	eng	I'm afraid that's not possible.
2541927	eng	I'm actually kind of flattered.
2541929	eng	I'm a fairly well-educated guy.
2541932	eng	I'll tell you everything later.
2541947	eng	I'll make all the arrangements.
2541964	eng	I'll decide what is irrelevant.
2541981	eng	I'll answer all your questions.
2542060	eng	I understand that you're angry.
2542076	eng	I thought you looked depressed.
2542077	eng	I thought you enjoyed swimming.
2542083	eng	I thought it looked suspicious.
2542098	eng	Have you reconsidered the plan?
2542101	eng	Your cell phone's not working.
2542103	eng	You've written a great speech.
2542105	eng	You've saved Tom's life twice.
2542107	eng	You've really helped me today.
2542109	eng	You've often said so yourself.
2542111	eng	You've been following me. Why?
2542114	eng	You're Tom's boss, aren't you?
2542115	eng	You're not listening, are you?
2542116	eng	You're not depressed, are you?
2542120	eng	You're a believer, aren't you?
2542121	eng	You'll always be Tom's father.
2542124	eng	You should've stayed with Tom.
2542130	eng	You could've stayed in Boston.
2542133	eng	Would you mind repeating that?
2542138	eng	Why aren't you wearing gloves?
2542143	eng	We're definitely not a couple.
2542148	eng	We often play tennis together.
2542153	eng	Tom, your food's getting cold.
2542156	eng	Tom wouldn't actually do that.
2542159	eng	Tom would never have approved.
2542171	eng	Tom witnessed the whole thing.
2542175	eng	Tom watched Mary with concern.
2542185	eng	Tom wants my telephone number.
2542187	eng	Tom wanted something to drink.
2542189	eng	Tom walked into the drugstore.
2542190	eng	Tom walked into his apartment.
2542192	eng	Tom walked along the sidewalk.
2542205	eng	Tom stubbed out his cigarette.
2542207	eng	Tom smiled at Mary sheepishly.
2542214	eng	Tom rubbed his hands together.
2542243	eng	Tom has written several books.
2542256	eng	Tom could've stayed in Boston.
2542257	eng	Tom complained about the food.
2542258	eng	Tom changed into his swimsuit.
2542266	eng	Tom became even more agitated.
2542268	eng	Tom asked the wrong questions.
2542274	eng	Tom asked Mary for assistance.
2542275	eng	Tom appears unwilling to help.
2542277	eng	Tom appears to be disoriented.
2542278	eng	Tom announced he was retiring.
2542282	eng	They wrote that song together.
2542283	eng	They won't bother you anymore.
2542287	eng	That's the solution, isn't it?
2542288	eng	That's the question, isn't it?
2542289	eng	Roses are my favorite flowers.
2542292	eng	Maybe we'll see some dolphins.
2542298	eng	I've studied French for years.
2542301	eng	I'm unfamiliar with that word.
2542302	eng	I'm unfamiliar with that term.
2542310	eng	I'm taking everything with me.
2542312	eng	I'm surprised you missed that.
2542313	eng	I'm surprised you don't agree.
2542315	eng	I'm sure you're not surprised.
2542323	eng	I'm sure Tom would understand.
2542331	eng	I'm sure Tom wasn't surprised.
2542332	eng	I'm sure Tom understands this.
2542333	eng	I'm sure Tom understands that.
2542340	eng	I'm sure Tom appreciates that.
2542343	eng	I'm sure there's a connection.
2542345	eng	I'm sure that's not necessary.
2542347	eng	I'm sure it's nothing serious.
2542365	eng	I'm sorry about what happened.
2542368	eng	I'm really good with children.
2542371	eng	I'm really excited about that.
2542379	eng	I'm not very easily impressed.
2542409	eng	I'm meeting Tom for breakfast.
2542414	eng	I'm just saying it's possible.
2542419	eng	I'm interested in helping Tom.
2542420	eng	I'm in enough trouble already.
2542423	eng	I'm here on official business.
2542425	eng	I'm here for personal reasons.
2542426	eng	I'm headed to the supermarket.
2542429	eng	I'm grateful that you're safe.
2542454	eng	I'm glad you're enjoying this.
2542460	eng	I'm getting married on Monday.

2542466	eng	I'm canceling class next week.
2542467	eng	I'm being charged with murder.
2542470	eng	I'm beginning to enjoy myself.
2542472	eng	I'm aware of the difficulties.
2542473	eng	I'm aware of that possibility.
2542476	eng	I'm against the death penalty.
2542482	eng	I'll wait thirty more minutes.
2542490	eng	I'll take whatever you've got.
2542494	eng	I'll see Tom tomorrow morning.
2542522	eng	I'll determine how we proceed.
2542524	eng	I'll continue to offer advice.
2542529	eng	I'll be waiting right outside.
2542590	eng	I wasn't looking for anything.
2542595	eng	I wasn't doing anything wrong.
2542620	eng	I was having trouble sleeping.
2542634	eng	I understand why you're angry.
2542656	eng	I thought you understood that.
2542659	eng	I thought you loved chocolate.
2542660	eng	I thought you liked everybody.
2542665	eng	I thought that was impossible.
2542667	eng	I thought I'd lost everything.
2542678	eng	I have a doctor's appointment.
2542686	eng	Everyone jumped into the pool.
2542690	eng	Both of them started laughing.
2542693	eng	Accidents happen all the time.
2542695	eng	You've told Tom, haven't you?
2542699	eng	You're not a millionaire yet.
2542700	eng	You're about three days late.
2542701	eng	You're a good assistant, Tom.
2542713	eng	You have thirty minutes left.
2542715	eng	Would you please check those?
2542720	eng	Where does Tom eat breakfast?
2542733	eng	Tom's friends laughed at him.
2542734	eng	Tom's favorite color is blue.
2542739	eng	Tom wouldn't return my calls.
2542742	eng	Tom wouldn't even discuss it.
2542745	eng	Tom would never kill himself.
2542746	eng	Tom works for the government.
2542748	eng	Tom wondered what that meant.
2542763	eng	Tom watched from the doorway.
2542767	eng	Tom was harboring a fugitive.
2542771	eng	Tom walked down the sidewalk.
2542772	eng	Tom walked down the corridor.
2542776	eng	Tom unscrewed the light bulb.
2542779	eng	Tom turned on the headlights.
2542780	eng	Tom turned on his flashlight.
2542783	eng	Tom thought that was amusing.
2542784	eng	Tom started yelling for help.
2542787	eng	Tom shuffled across the room.
2542788	eng	Tom showed Mary John's photo.
2542791	eng	Tom says he'll come tomorrow.
2542798	eng	Tom rushed down the corridor.
2542803	eng	Tom opened all three letters.
2542805	eng	Tom listened to Mary singing.
2542808	eng	Tom knows about this already.
2542811	eng	Tom isn't paying us anything.
2542815	eng	Tom is slowly getting better.
2542819	eng	Tom is angry and embarrassed.
2542821	eng	Tom is a special-needs child.
2542826	eng	Tom has a contagious disease.
2542828	eng	Tom gave Mary John's message.
2542830	eng	Tom excused himself and left.
2542831	eng	Tom drove to the supermarket.
2542834	eng	Tom doesn't have any friends.
2542836	eng	Tom couldn't take it anymore.
2542838	eng	Tom ate breakfast by himself.
2542840	eng	Tom asked too many questions.
2542848	eng	Tom appears to have vanished.
2542851	eng	Tom angrily shoved Mary away.
2542852	eng	Tom angrily pushed Mary away.
2542854	eng	Tom and Mary switched places.
2542855	eng	Tom and Mary played checkers.
2542858	eng	This shouldn't take too long.
2542859	eng	This is the captain speaking.
2542860	eng	They're all wearing name tags.
2542861	eng	They don't have enough money.
2542862	eng	The walls were painted white.
2542863	eng	That's the problem, isn't it?
2542864	eng	That wouldn't change a thing.
2542868	eng	Maybe I shouldn't drive home.
2542871	eng	I've already thought of that.
2542878	eng	I'm very allergic to peanuts.
2542880	eng	I'm trying to understand you.
2542892	eng	I'm surprised Tom isn't here.
2542895	eng	I'm sure you understand that.
2542897	eng	I'm sure Tom will understand.
2542899	eng	I'm sure Tom is exaggerating.
2542904	eng	I'm sure it's just temporary.
2542907	eng	I'm still thinking about Tom.
2542921	eng	I'm simply stating the facts.
2542922	eng	I'm seeing Tom again tonight.
2542925	eng	I'm running for city council.
2542926	eng	I'm really worried about Tom.
2542927	eng	I'm really good with animals.
2542934	eng	I'm not your teacher anymore.
2542937	eng	I'm not taking anyone's side.
2542939	eng	I'm not sure that's possible.
2542942	eng	I'm not saying anything else.
2542943	eng	I'm not responsible for this.
2542962	eng	I'm not forgetting about you.
2542966	eng	I'm no longer your assistant.
2542967	eng	I'm little worried about Tom.
2542968	eng	I'm just waiting for someone.
2542973	eng	I'm just a concerned citizen.
2542975	eng	I'm having problems with Tom.
2542977	eng	I'm going upstairs to change.
2543011	eng	I'm glad you're doing better.
2543012	eng	I'm glad you weren't injured.
2543020	eng	I'm glad that you understand.
2543029	eng	I'm disappointed in you, Tom.
2543033	eng	I'm calling in sick tomorrow.
2543035	eng	I'm beginning to get curious.
2543036	eng	I'm beginning to feel stupid.
2543037	eng	I'm aware of the possibility.
2543038	eng	I'm auditioning for the part.
2543052	eng	I'm afraid I'm not available.
2543054	eng	I'm actually looking for Tom.
2543055	eng	I'm absolutely certain of it.
2543058	eng	I'm a little behind schedule.
2543065	eng	I'll tell Tom this afternoon.
2543067	eng	I'll take care of everything.
2543076	eng	I'll never forget Tom's face.
2543079	eng	I'll need about five minutes.
2543094	eng	I'll give you thirty minutes.
2543095	eng	I'll give you thirty dollars.
2543096	eng	I'll give you another minute.
2543101	eng	I'll come visit you tomorrow.
2543125	eng	I'd recommend not doing that.
2543130	eng	I'd forgotten all about that.
2543133	eng	I wrote down the information.
2543134	eng	I wouldn't mind some company.
2543135	eng	I wouldn't leave without you.
2543139	eng	I would appreciate your help.
2543140	eng	I worry about that sometimes.
2543152	eng	I won't answer your question.
2543163	eng	I wish things were different.
2543174	eng	I wasn't expecting you today.
2543198	eng	I understand why you're here.
2543216	eng	I thought you were different.
2543217	eng	I thought you studied French.
2543218	eng	I thought you said something.
2543222	eng	I thought you loved swimming.
2543229	eng	I thought this was important.
2543230	eng	I thought they'd never leave.
2543242	eng	How many lifeboats are there?
2543244	eng	Do you want anything special?
2543245	eng	Do you want another sandwich?
2543251	eng	All my friends have bicycles.
2543253	eng	You've told me that already.
2543255	eng	You've probably heard of us.
2543256	eng	You've probably heard of me.
2543257	eng	You've got to be reasonable.
2543258	eng	You've already told me that.
2543259	eng	You're with Tom, aren't you?
2543260	eng	You're very important to us.
2543261	eng	You're not serious, are you?
2543262	eng	You're not leaving, are you?
2543265	eng	You're acting like an idiot.
2543266	eng	You're a member, aren't you?
2543268	eng	You wouldn't stand a chance.
2543271	eng	You were angry, weren't you?
2543272	eng	You signed for the delivery.
2543273	eng	You should find another job.
2543274	eng	You haven't changed one bit.
2543275	eng	You have very little choice.
2543276	eng	You can't stay here anymore.
2543277	eng	You can't live here anymore.
2543278	eng	Would you move back, please?
2543280	eng	Would you follow me, please?
2543281	eng	Why doesn't Tom like Boston?
2543283	eng	Who makes breakfast for Tom?
2543285	eng	When does Tom eat breakfast?
2543287	eng	What're you guys doing here?
2543289	eng	We're very sorry about that.
2543290	eng	We're not letting anyone go.
2543291	eng	We're not in school anymore.
2543292	eng	We're not all students here.
2543293	eng	We're all very good players.
2543294	eng	We're about to have company.
2543295	eng	We'll work on this tomorrow.
2543298	eng	We'll all be there together.
2543300	eng	We take long walks together.
2543302	eng	We know everything you know.
2543304	eng	Tom's room isn't very large.
2543305	eng	Tom's birthday is next week.
2543310	eng	Tom wouldn't stand a chance.
2543312	eng	Tom wouldn't have said that.
2543313	eng	Tom wouldn't have done that.
2543314	eng	Tom wouldn't be that stupid.
2543315	eng	Tom would never hurt anyone.
2543317	eng	Tom wondered where Mary was.
2543320	eng	Tom wished Mary would leave.
2543321	eng	Tom will handle the details.
2543324	eng	Tom watched from a distance.
2543332	eng	Tom wanted something to eat.
2543334	eng	Tom walked around the store.
2543335	eng	Tom waited for the elevator.
2543337	eng	Tom turned off the computer.
2543338	eng	Tom turned off his computer.
2543339	eng	Tom tumbled down the stairs.
2543343	eng	Tom told Mary what happened.
2543348	eng	Tom threw Mary the baseball.
2543349	eng	Tom switched on the machine.
2543353	eng	Tom said he liked rain.
2543355	eng	Tom said goodnight to Mary.
2543356	eng	Tom refused to eat anything.
2543358	eng	Tom poured Mary some coffee.
2543361	eng	Tom often screens his calls.
2543363	eng	Tom noticed Mary was crying.
2543364	eng	Tom needs money for college.
2543365	eng	Tom needed something to eat.
2543371	eng	Tom kept checking his watch.
2543373	eng	Tom isn't dating anyone now.
2543376	eng	Tom is relocating to Boston.
2543377	eng	Tom is out grocery shopping.
2543378	eng	Tom is Mary's new boyfriend.
2543380	eng	Tom is friendly to everyone.
2543381	eng	Tom is angry and frustrated.
2543385	eng	Tom is a little embarrassed.
2543386	eng	Tom is a little disoriented.
2543389	eng	Tom has everything he wants.
2543390	eng	Tom has everything he needs.
2543395	eng	Tom giggled and Mary smiled.
2543400	eng	Tom didn't obey his parents.
2543402	eng	Tom crawled under the fence.
2543404	eng	Tom collapsed to the ground.
2543406	eng	Tom chuckled at Mary's joke.
2543407	eng	Tom checked his phone again.
2543409	eng	Tom borrowed $300 from Mary.
2543417	eng	Tom asked for my assistance.
2543418	eng	Tom asked for Mary's advice.
2543419	eng	Tom asked everyone to leave.
2543420	eng	Tom appeared out of nowhere.
2543421	eng	Tom appeared a moment later.
2543423	eng	Tom answered his front door.
2543424	eng	Tom answered his cell phone.
2543425	eng	Tom angrily closed the door.
2543427	eng	They're a couple of hippies.
2543428	eng	They're a couple of cowards.
2543429	eng	They're a bunch of windbags.
2543430	eng	They'll all be here tonight.
2543433	eng	The car stereo doesn't work.
2543435	eng	That isn't necessary, is it?
2543437	eng	Someone's in the other room.
2543438	eng	Someone tried to poison Tom.
2543440	eng	Maybe I shouldn't have come.
2543446	eng	I'm willing to try anything.
2543449	eng	I'm waiting for your answer.
2543450	eng	I'm very unhappy about this.
2543451	eng	I'm very serious about this.
2543454	eng	I'm trying to be supportive.
2543455	eng	I'm touched by your concern.
2543456	eng	I'm thinking we should move.
2543457	eng	I'm thinking the same thing.
2543468	eng	I'm sure that's not correct.
2543471	eng	I'm sure it's a coincidence.
2543474	eng	I'm supposed to protect you.
2543477	eng	I'm still worried about Tom.
2543480	eng	I'm sorry, but you're wrong.
2543481	eng	I'm sorry, but we're closed.
2543485	eng	I'm sorry I interrupted you.
2543486	eng	I'm running late for school.
2543489	eng	I'm really stupid, aren't I?
2543490	eng	I'm really sorry about this.
2543491	eng	I'm really sorry about that.
2543492	eng	I'm really glad you're here.
2543499	eng	I'm pretty good at guessing.
2543500	eng	I'm pretty excited about it.
2543502	eng	I'm one of Tom's assistants.
2543516	eng	I'm not sure about anything.
2543521	eng	I'm not satisfied with that.
2543526	eng	I'm not making myself clear.
2543527	eng	I'm not making any promises.
2543528	eng	I'm not looking for trouble.
2543533	eng	I'm not leaving without you.
2543534	eng	I'm not leaving without Tom.
2543543	eng	I'm not getting any younger.
2543546	eng	I'm not ashamed of anything.
2543549	eng	I'm not afraid of lightning.
2543550	eng	I'm never helping you again.
2543552	eng	I'm never eating here again.
2543556	eng	I'm leaving early next week.
2543557	eng	I'm late for an appointment.
2543564	eng	I'm just catching my breath.
2543565	eng	I'm just a little surprised.
2543566	eng	I'm intrigued by Tom's idea.
2543567	eng	I'm inclined to believe Tom.
2543576	eng	I'm going to start tomorrow.
2543593	eng	I'm going to check upstairs.
2543596	eng	I'm glad you're enjoying it.
2543597	eng	I'm glad you suggested this.
2543598	eng	I'm glad we're together now.
2543599	eng	I'm glad we're in agreement.
2543604	eng	I'm getting ahead of myself.
2543605	eng	I'm getting advice from Tom.
2543606	eng	I'm getting a little hungry.
2543608	eng	I'm curious about one thing.
2543609	eng	I'm calling the meeting off.
2543610	eng	I'm better looking than you.
2543612	eng	I'm aware of its importance.
2543615	eng	I'm afraid we're stuck here.
2543620	eng	I'm a little thirsty myself.
2543625	eng	I'll tell you what happened.
2543631	eng	I'll still be here tomorrow.
2543634	eng	I'll settle things with Tom.
2543635	eng	I'll set up the appointment.
2543640	eng	I'll see you after practice.
2543641	eng	I'll see Tom tomorrow night.
2543642	eng	I'll see to that personally.
2543643	eng	I'll probably see you there.
2543657	eng	I'll keep the motor running.
2543664	eng	I'll have somebody help you.
2543670	eng	I'll give you some examples.
2543671	eng	I'll get you another lawyer.
2543672	eng	I'll get Tom's home address.
2543673	eng	I'll get started right away.
2543678	eng	I'll drive Tom there myself.
2543680	eng	I'll demonstrate it for you.
2543684	eng	I'll call Tom and apologize.
2543686	eng	I'll be your server tonight.
2543691	eng	I'll be perfectly all right.
2543695	eng	I'll be coming back tonight.
2543697	eng	I'll be back tomorrow night.
2543698	eng	I'll be back this afternoon.
2543701	eng	I'll be back before morning.
2543703	eng	I'd rather not discuss that.
2543704	eng	I'd never betray your trust.
2543708	eng	I'd heard what had happened.
2543713	eng	I'd already thought of that.
2543715	eng	I wouldn't worry about that.
2543716	eng	I wouldn't mind helping Tom.
2543717	eng	I wouldn't like that either.
2543718	eng	I would've done that anyway.
2543720	eng	I wonder when that happened.
2543743	eng	I wasn't worried about that.
2543744	eng	I wasn't very hungry anyway.
2543754	eng	I was traveling on business.
2543756	eng	I was thinking about Boston.
2543757	eng	I was talking about clothes.
2543758	eng	I was swamped with homework.
2543761	eng	I was out getting groceries.
2543770	eng	I was just following orders.
2543791	eng	I understand what you meant.
2543793	eng	I tried calling your office.
2543794	eng	I took Tom's blood pressure.
2543813	eng	I thought you wouldn't mind.
2543815	eng	I thought you were grounded.
2543817	eng	I thought you understood me.
2543820	eng	I thought you loved reading.

2543844	eng	I looked over the documents.
2543853	eng	Don't you have any ambition?
2543855	eng	Both of them started crying.
2543856	eng	Aren't you curious about it?
2543857	eng	Your French is good enough.
2543859	eng	You've told me that before.
2543860	eng	You've saved all our lives.
2543861	eng	You've said nothing so far.
2543865	eng	You're with me, aren't you?

2543868	eng	Your time is running out.
2543870	eng	You're not scared, are you?
2543871	eng	You're not joking, are you?
2543874	eng	You're a very good teacher.
2543878	eng	You'd regret that, I think.
2543882	eng	You won't be safe anywhere.
2543883	eng	You picked Tom, didn't you?
2543885	eng	You know this is different.
2543887	eng	You have something of mine.
2543888	eng	You have a good reputation.
2543890	eng	You don't know anyone here.
2543892	eng	Would you stop saying that?
2543893	eng	Would you please step back?
2543894	eng	Would you please excuse us?
2543895	eng	Would you please come here?
2543898	eng	Why are you wearing gloves?
2543900	eng	Whatever you do, don't cry.
2543903	eng	We're waiting to be served.
2543904	eng	We're running out of money.

2544208	eng	I'm fairly sure it'll work.
2544212	eng	I'm delighted to hear that.
2544214	eng	I'm calling from my mobile.

2544217	eng	I'm aware of your problems.
2544218	eng	I'm aware of the situation.
2544220	eng	I'm anxious to get started.

2544296	eng	I'll call for an ambulance.
2544297	eng	I'll be taking Tom's place.
2544305	eng	I'll always care about you.
2544306	eng	I'll always believe in you.
2544309	eng	I'd think that was obvious.
2544313	eng	I'd rather not discuss Tom.
2544317	eng	I'd like some help, please.
2544319	eng	I'd better think this over.
2544320	eng	I'd better tell the others.
2544321	eng	I'd better get back inside.
2544323	eng	I'd better be getting home.
2544325	eng	I wouldn't worry about Tom.
2544333	eng	I wonder where everyone is.
2544363	eng	I wasn't talking about you.
2544364	eng	I wasn't talking about Tom.
2544377	eng	I was just getting started.
2544411	eng	I thought you'd be excited.
2544415	eng	I thought you might change.
2544416	eng	I thought you looked tired.
2544418	eng	I thought we were partners.
2544419	eng	I thought we said tomorrow.
2544423	eng	I thought this was settled.
2544424	eng	I thought it'd take months.
2544426	eng	I thought it was excellent.
2544448	eng	Do you know the difference?
2544449	eng	Did you say something, Tom?
2544453	eng	Your name's Tom, isn't it?
2544454	eng	You've walked into a trap.

2544467	eng	You're not going, are you?
2544468	eng	You're not a teenager yet.
2544471	eng	You're a good friend, Tom.
2544475	eng	You know this is nonsense.
2544476	eng	You know nothing about me.
2544478	eng	You have to eat something.
2544486	eng	Why doesn't Tom like Mary?
2544493	eng	We're sorry for your loss.
2544498	eng	We don't need Tom anymore.
2544500	eng	We all missed the meeting.
2544501	eng	Tom's not with us anymore.
2544503	eng	Tom's not in the hospital.

2544508	eng	Tom yelled over the music.
2544510	eng	Tom wouldn't listen to me.
2544511	eng	Tom wouldn't have said no.
2544517	eng	Tom wiped the table clean.
2544518	eng	Tom will never forgive me.
2544521	eng	Tom went into his bedroom.
2544522	eng	Tom wasn't gone very long.
2544524	eng	Tom was reloading his gun.
2544527	eng	Tom was drenched in sweat.
2544528	eng	Tom wanted to lose weight.

2544534	eng	Tom turned out the lights.
2544536	eng	Tom took out his earplugs.
2544537	eng	Tom took off his raincoat.
2544538	eng	Tom spoke to Mary quietly.
2544539	eng	Tom shut the kitchen door.

2544557	eng	Tom offered Mary his beer.
2544558	eng	Tom offered Mary a choice.
2544559	eng	Tom moved a little closer.
2544561	eng	Tom looks like a criminal.
2544563	eng	Tom looked in the drawers.
2544564	eng	Tom listened for a moment.
2544565	eng	Tom listened for a minute.
2544566	eng	Tom knows what this means.
2544567	eng	Tom knows we aren't happy.
2544568	eng	Tom jumped over the fence.
2544569	eng	Tom jumped out the window.
2544571	eng	Tom jumped into the water.
2544575	eng	Tom is in there somewhere.

2544603	eng	Tom didn't deserve to die.
2544604	eng	Tom climbed up the ladder.
2544605	eng	Tom cleared off the table.
2544606	eng	Tom brought Mary a coffee.
2544613	eng	Tom appears to be winning.
2544615	eng	Tom appears to be nervous.
2544618	eng	They're a bunch of losers.
2544621	eng	They don't have any money.
2544622	eng	The park was almost empty.
2544627	eng	Tell Tom this is hopeless.
2544629	eng	Someone is always on duty.
2544635	eng	It isn't necessary, is it?
2544636	eng	It doesn't get any easier.
2544639	eng	I'm waiting for an answer.
2544640	eng	I'm usually not this busy.
2544641	eng	I'm used to being ignored.
2544642	eng	I'm trying to protect you.
2544643	eng	I'm trying to protect Tom.
2544648	eng	I'm telling the truth now.
2544650	eng	I'm taking my lunch break.
2544651	eng	I'm taking a semester off.
2544661	eng	I'm sure it's Tom's fault.
2544662	eng	I'm sure glad that's over.
2544664	eng	I'm still working on this.
2544665	eng	I'm still working on that.
2544666	eng	I'm still married to Mary.
2544667	eng	I'm still looking for Tom.
2544668	eng	I'm still kind of thirsty.
2544669	eng	I'm staying at the Hilton.
2544671	eng	I'm sorry Tom wasn't here.
2544675	eng	I'm sorry for the trouble.
2544676	eng	I'm sorry about your loss.
2544677	eng	I'm sorry about the noise.
2544678	eng	I'm sorry about that, Tom.
2544681	eng	I'm sitting here with Tom.
2544684	eng	I'm seeing a pattern here.
2544685	eng	I'm running out of energy.
2544686	eng	I'm running a little late.
2544687	eng	I'm real upset about that.
2544688	eng	I'm pretty sure it's true.
2544695	eng	I'm offering you a choice.
2544696	eng	I'm not worried about you.
2544698	eng	I'm not thirsty right now.
2544699	eng	I'm not telling you again.
2544700	eng	I'm not talking about Tom.
2544701	eng	I'm not sure you're ready.
2544703	eng	I'm not sure I understand.
2544705	eng	I'm not supposed to drink.
2544707	eng	I'm not satisfied with it.
2544708	eng	I'm not prepared for this.
2544712	eng	I'm not like that anymore.
2544713	eng	I'm not like other people.
2544717	eng	I'm not going without you.

2544780	eng	I'm going to drive myself.
2544791	eng	I'm going back to college.
2544792	eng	I'm glad you're my friend.
2544793	eng	I'm glad you're here, Tom.
2544794	eng	I'm glad you're all right.
2544795	eng	I'm glad you weren't here.
2544796	eng	I'm glad you realize that.
2544798	eng	I'm glad that you're here.
2544800	eng	I'm getting tired of this.

2544817	eng	I'm a pretty good student.
2544820	eng	I'll try to remember that.
2544822	eng	I'll try to distract them.
2544823	eng	I'll text you the address.
2544826	eng	I'll tell Tom you're here.
2544829	eng	I'll talk to you tomorrow.
2544839	eng	I'll see what is possible.
2544843	eng	I'll never leave you, Tom.

2544908	eng	I wouldn't change a thing.
2544909	eng	I would've sent Tom money.
2544910	eng	I would advise against it.
2544913	eng	I wondered where Tom went.

2544997	eng	I thought you were taller.
2544998	eng	I thought we were friends.
2544999	eng	I thought we should leave.
2545001	eng	I thought they'd heard us.
2545005	eng	I shouldn't have slept in.
2545012	eng	I didn't prepare a speech.
2545015	eng	Don't you have an opinion?
2545018	eng	Do you have any sunscreen?
2545021	eng	Could I borrow your ruler?
2545022	eng	Business is very good now.
2545024	eng	Are you worried about Tom?
2545026	eng	Are you feeling all right?
2545027	eng	Are you asking my opinion?

2643797	eng	You must be feeling better.
2643800	eng	You have so much potential.
2643808	eng	Why is this cabinet locked?

2644492	eng	This is Tom, my assistant.
2644493	eng	This is difficult for Tom.
2644494	eng	They'll be ready for that.
2644495	eng	There's no doubt about it.
2644497	eng	The gun hadn't been fired.
2644498	eng	That's your job, isn't it?
2644501	eng	That was your third drink.
2644504	eng	Thanks for the help, guys.
2644505	eng	Thank you for your candor.

2644515	eng	Shouldn't you be in there?
2644517	eng	See you in thirty minutes.
2644519	eng	Put on your seatbelt, Tom.
2644520	eng	Perhaps Tom had it coming.
2644521	eng	Nobody was busy except me.
2644522	eng	Mary was Tom's first wife.
2644523	eng	Mary put on some lipstick.
2644524	eng	Mary is now my girlfriend.
2644525	eng	Mary is an old girlfriend.
2644526	eng	Love is a beautiful thing.
2644528	eng	Listen, we have a problem.
2644529	eng	Keep this to yourself, Tom.
2644530	eng	It's your money, isn't it?
2644535	eng	It all happened very fast.
2644536	eng	Is it your birthday today?
2644537	eng	I've never met Tom's wife.
2644540	eng	I'm sorry I said anything.
2644544	eng	I wasn't very busy anyway.
2644548	eng	I thought you'd be hungry.
2644550	eng	I thought Tom wasn't busy.
2644561	eng	How long's Tom been there?
2644563	eng	How have you been feeling?
2644567	eng	Has Tom had many visitors?
2644568	eng	Has that been done before?
2644569	eng	Half of them are students.
2644571	eng	Give Tom something to eat.
2644574	eng	Does Tom have an attorney?
2644575	eng	Does anybody have a match?

2644590	eng	Did you do the decorating?
2644591	eng	Did you do that purposely?
2644592	eng	Could you babysit my boys?
2644593	eng	Could Tom have been there?
2644595	eng	Both of them are confused.
2644600	eng	Are they keeping you busy?
2644604	eng	Your wife's on the phone.
2644605	eng	You're not wearing a tie.
2644606	eng	You're not that old, Tom.
2644608	eng	You're not busy, are you?
2644609	eng	You're no friend of mine.
2644610	eng	You're in the wrong seat.
2644615	eng	You'd better have a plan.
2644616	eng	You were right, you know.
2644617	eng	You were a teenager then.
2644618	eng	You three are very lucky.
2644619	eng	You said you were thirty.
2644620	eng	You said you were hungry.
2644621	eng	You said you needed help.
2644622	eng	You said we were invited.
2644623	eng	You said we were friends.
2644624	eng	You said Tom was adopted.
2644625	eng	You people are my guests.
2644626	eng	You opened the wrong box.
2644627	eng	You only have three days.
2644629	eng	You need to face reality.
2644631	eng	You must be very excited.
2644632	eng	You must be Tom's sister.
2644633	eng	You must be Tom's father.
2644635	eng	You must be the Jacksons.
2644637	eng	You know that isn't true.
2644639	eng	You have my full support.
2644640	eng	You don't seem too happy.
2644641	eng	You don't seem so hungry.
2644642	eng	You don't look very busy.
2644645	eng	Wouldn't that be a shame?
2644646	eng	Would you say that again?
2644647	eng	Would you really do that?
2644648	eng	Would you like more wine?
2644654	eng	Why have you deceived us?
2644656	eng	Why aren't you in school?
2644657	eng	Why aren't you in Boston?
2644658	eng	Why aren't you here, Tom?
2644660	eng	Why are you wearing that?
2644661	eng	Why are you a Republican?
2644662	eng	Why are they saying that?
2644663	eng	Who's picking up the tab?
2644665	eng	Who's going to wear them?
2644673	eng	Where have you been, Tom?
2644674	eng	Where are you going, Tom?
2644675	eng	What've you done with it?
2644680	eng	What's on your mind, Tom?
2644682	eng	What're we doing in here?
2644683	eng	What you did was illegal.
2644684	eng	What was in the envelope?
2644685	eng	What was in that package?
2644686	eng	What time did they leave?
2644690	eng	What have you heard, Tom?
2644691	eng	What have you found, Tom?
2644697	eng	What did Tom say exactly?
2644701	eng	What are you smirking at?
2644705	eng	What are they doing here?
2644707	eng	Were you in the military?
2644708	eng	Were you and Tom friends?
2644710	eng	We're the only ones left.
2644713	eng	We're not ready for this.
2644715	eng	We're almost out of time.
2644716	eng	We're almost out of fuel.
2644718	eng	We're all agreed on that.
2644720	eng	We weren't all that busy.
2644722	eng	We were all watching Tom.
2644723	eng	We were all very thirsty.
2644726	eng	We want nothing from you.
2644728	eng	We only have three hours.
2644731	eng	We need to eat something.
2644733	eng	We need a new babysitter.
2644734	eng	We must know for certain.
2644736	eng	We have the same dentist.
2644739	eng	We have so many students.
2644741	eng	We had nothing in common.
2644742	eng	We had a little argument.
2644743	eng	We could meet after work.
2644744	eng	We care about each other.
2644746	eng	We all have dark secrets.
2644749	eng	Tom's wife picked him up.
2644750	eng	Tom's not ready for that.
2644751	eng	Tom's eyes are wide open.
2644753	eng	Tom wiped his tears away.
2644756	eng	Tom was wrong about that.
2644757	eng	Tom was worried about me.
2644762	eng	Tom was tired and hungry.
2644765	eng	Tom was never my partner.
2644766	eng	Tom was murdered by Mary.
2644768	eng	Tom was in that building.
2644774	eng	Tom was asking about you.
2644775	eng	Tom was a little shocked.

2650191	eng	I want to see, too!
2650229	eng	Help is on its way.
2650306	eng	We use really state-of-the-art equipment.
2650860	eng	I hope you understand that.
2650885	eng	I think it's getting better.
2650888	eng	I love to read books.
2650907	eng	We work in a factory.
2650910	eng	Tom, come check this out.
2650914	eng	It's not gonna bite you.
2650939	eng	Don't worry about the baby.
2650963	eng	I can live without water.
2650974	eng	That's the word for it.
2651497	eng	This is a long pencil.
2651522	eng	That is a long pencil.
2651524	eng	It is a long pencil.
2651555	eng	The new house is here.
2651607	eng	You sleep in my room.
2651623	eng	I ask you a question.
2651630	eng	I ask her a question.
2651687	eng	Emily asked me a question.
2652175	eng	No doctor can explain that.
2652307	eng	It is a beautiful city.
2652325	eng	I'm here for another reason.
2652429	eng	He has a blue bicycle.
2652616	eng	I sleep at ten o'clock.
2652634	eng	This should not be allowed.
2652819	eng	I didn't drink the water.
2652821	eng	I didn't drink the milk.
2652885	eng	I really miss you all.
2652902	eng	May you be happy, Ricardo.
2652924	eng	May our friendship be eternal.
2652934	eng	Your submission is great! Congratulations!
2653106	eng	The river is also polluted.
2653176	eng	He works on Wall Street.
2653177	eng	This restaurant is ridiculously overpriced.
2653212	eng	That's right up my alley.
2653242	eng	What are all those bruises?
2653246	eng	She talked my ears off.
2653656	eng	Emily is writing a letter.
2653677	eng	What's-his-name was in church today.
2653769	eng	Ricardo is my first name.
2653820	eng	I sing a beautiful song.
2654197	eng	She made a macrame bracelet.
2654206	eng	The cold lasted three weeks.
2654305	eng	I must do my homework.
2654308	eng	You must do your homework.
2654309	eng	You're doing it ass backwards.
2654359	eng	Her first answer was laudable.
2654523	eng	She finds her parents embarrassing.
2654526	eng	He's trying to be cool.
2654547	eng	Establish contact with me tomorrow.
2654567	eng	I found this test difficult.
2654610	eng	He's a climate change denier.
2654639	eng	This is an elementary mistake.
2654640	eng	Please don't get me wrong.
2654662	eng	I wanted to slap myself.
2654677	eng	Science is not a religion.
2654701	eng	It's a labor of love.
2654806	eng	Do you have a dictionary?
2654810	eng	I need a better dictionary.
2654826	eng	You should write a letter.
2654838	eng	I want to learn Swedish.
2654841	eng	I returned to the house.
2654872	eng	Chill out now. Calm down.
2654891	eng	Are you good at sports?
2654908	eng	Does Emily have a dictionary?
2654911	eng	Does Laurie have a computer?
2655073	eng	Who sees my son's rose?
2655105	eng	Make each day your masterpiece.
2655154	eng	All life is an experiment.
2655185	eng	Loneliness is the ultimate poverty.
2655198	eng	I don't like to walk.
2655547	eng	Marriage is a covered dish.
2656404	eng	I speak a few languages.
2656977	eng	Why am I not surprised?
2657011	eng	Good always triumphs over evil.
2657511	eng	I live in a city.
2657534	eng	I'll live in the city.
2657711	eng	Do I have a knife?
2658147	eng	There's no other possible explanation.
2658206	eng	When will it get better?
2658239	eng	Mrs. Wood cooks very well.
2658251	eng	None of them have wives.
2658348	eng	Tom put on his socks.
2658467	eng	Be afraid. Be very afraid.
2658484	eng	Hurry up and get ready.
2658732	eng	I’m fancying an American firm.
2659015	eng	I learned it by heart.
2659137	eng	Laurie sat on the chair.
2659510	eng	Which school is the best?
2659524	eng	Every colour has a meaning.
2659530	eng	I changed the baby's nappy.
2659531	eng	The nappy smells very dirty.
2659533	eng	We travelled around the world.
2659574	eng	I dreamt a strange dream.
2659596	eng	Solid water is called ice.
2659614	eng	Do you have smaller sizes?
2659659	eng	What browser are you using?
2659685	eng	You'd better see a doctor.
2660289	eng	But he has bad manners.
2660301	eng	There's no gain without pain.
2660304	eng	Go is my only distraction.
2660310	eng	No rich people live here.
2660312	eng	The nail pierced the wall.
2660328	eng	The girls greeted us warmly.
2660353	eng	This global company follows GAAP.
2661218	eng	100 dollars? That's pocket change!
2661238	eng	Tom almost never asks questions.
2661317	eng	Sit in that chair, please.
2661472	eng	Insects are full of proteins.
2661475	eng	Have you ever eaten insects?
2661650	eng	The Zeppelin caught on fire.
2661651	eng	The airship burst into flames.
2661742	eng	I went to the hospital.
2661760	eng	He slept in the bed.
2661821	eng	I was playing the violin.
2661854	eng	Please read it once more.
2661904	eng	This is not my ticket.
2661921	eng	The children are already tired.
2662185	eng	She's not a child anymore.
2662186	eng	He's not a child anymore.
2662193	eng	Her new boyfriend is black.
2662197	eng	He did that on purpose.
2662234	eng	She has a cool job.
2662394	eng	Suddenly the lights went out.
2662400	eng	We always go home together.
2662404	eng	The gun suddenly went off.
2662410	eng	Let's get some fresh air.
2662412	eng	The room is very gloomy.
2662414	eng	Don't go to any trouble.
2662420	eng	This is a free country.
2662424	eng	The sugar is all gone.
2662444	eng	Why didn't anyone warn me?
2662931	eng	Maybe you're oversimplifying the problem.
2663046	eng	Fortunately, I've solved your problem.
2663055	eng	We're having some equipment problems.
2663110	eng	Let's discuss that problem tomorrow.
2663122	eng	Who's responsible for this problem?
2663168	eng	Tom has trouble remembering names.
2663177	eng	That's a very complicated problem.
2663180	eng	Our main problem remains unsolved.
2663181	eng	No mechanical problems were found.
2663186	eng	It's a fairly complicated problem.
2663197	eng	Everybody tells me their problems.
2663201	eng	Are you having financial problems?
2663202	eng	You've got some serious problems.
2663209	eng	We'll discuss this problem later.
2663215	eng	This is potentially your problem.
2663241	eng	I have trouble remembering names.
2663253	eng	Tom has some emotional problems.
2663254	eng	Tom has serious health problems.
2663257	eng	Tom didn't anticipate a problem.
2663258	eng	This is somebody else's problem.
2663264	eng	That's not your problem anymore.
2663266	eng	That is potentially our problem.
2663280	eng	I don't anticipate any problems.
2663286	eng	You've obviously got a problem.
2663287	eng	What's Tom's problem with Mary?
2663288	eng	We'll look into these problems.
2663298	eng	There shouldn't be any problem.
2663299	eng	The location isn't the problem.
2663300	eng	That doesn't solve the problem.
2663302	eng	Stop looking for problems, Tom.
2663309	eng	It's just a mechanical problem.
2663321	eng	Did you encounter any problems?
2663325	eng	What exactly was your problem?
2663326	eng	We've got this problem licked.
2663329	eng	Tom tried solving the problem.
2663330	eng	Tom solved the problem easily.
2663333	eng	There's one problem with this.
2663335	eng	There's just one tiny problem.
2663336	eng	There's just one problem here.
2663338	eng	There are still some problems.
2663339	eng	That's your problem, not mine.
2663342	eng	That's a very complex problem.
2663345	eng	That shouldn't be any problem.
2663346	eng	That should solve the problem.
2663347	eng	That isn't Tom's only problem.
2663350	eng	Maybe that's the real problem.
2663351	eng	It's not your problem, anyway.
2663363	eng	Does Tom have mental problems?
2663366	eng	Anyway, it's not your problem.
2663368	eng	All Tom's problems are solved.
2663369	eng	You'll have no more problems.
2663370	eng	You obviously have a problem.
2663372	eng	What's your problem with Tom?
2663373	eng	What's Tom's problem with me?
2663375	eng	We've got some problems here.
2663376	eng	We're working on the problem.
2663378	eng	We couldn't find the problem.
2663384	eng	That wasn't the only problem.
2663390	eng	Maybe that's not the problem.
2663395	eng	I heard about Tom's problems.
2663398	eng	Do you understand my problem?
2663399	eng	Did Tom mention any problems?
2663402	eng	What's the problem with Tom?
2663403	eng	What's the problem now, Tom?
2663404	eng	What exactly is the problem?
2663410	eng	Tom has an attitude problem.
2663412	eng	Tom had a problem yesterday.
2663415	eng	This problem affects us all.
2663417	eng	This is our biggest problem.
2663418	eng	This could become a problem.
2663419	eng	There's no problem with Tom.
2663420	eng	There's a problem with that.
2663422	eng	The problem has been solved.
2663423	eng	That's not our only problem.
2663425	eng	That's how I solve problems.
2663426	eng	That's a pretty big problem.
2663427	eng	That shouldn't be a problem.
2663430	eng	Let's not look for problems.
2663431	eng	It's not a computer problem.
2663435	eng	I'm good at problem solving.
2663438	eng	I found some other problems.
2663439	eng	Hey, that's not our problem.
2663441	eng	Can you correct the problem?
2663442	eng	And what's your problem now?
2663443	eng	Your problem's not with me.
2663446	eng	We've got our own problems.
2663447	eng	We'll work the problem out.
2663449	eng	This is really the problem.
2663451	eng	There was only one problem.
2663452	eng	The problem is finding Tom.
2663453	eng	The problem here isn't Tom.
2663454	eng	That's not our problem now.
2663455	eng	That's not my problem, Tom.
2663456	eng	That's no longer a problem.
2663457	eng	That's my problem with Tom.
2663459	eng	It's Tom who's the problem.
2663460	eng	It's not a problem anymore.
2663461	eng	It's my problem, not yours.
2663465	eng	I think we've got problems.
2663467	eng	I didn't have any problems.
2663468	eng	Are there problems at home?
2663470	eng	We have some new problems.
2663472	eng	Tom is becoming a problem.
2663474	eng	Tom had the same problems.
2663478	eng	The problem here isn't me.
2663482	eng	That was never my problem.
2663483	eng	That should be no problem.
2663486	eng	It's the same old problem.
2663489	eng	It's just a minor problem.
2663490	eng	It shouldn't be a problem.
2663496	eng	You have a problem there.
2663499	eng	We've got a real problem.
2663509	eng	Life is full of problems.
2663510	eng	It was really no problem.
2663511	eng	Is this a budget problem?
2663512	eng	Is there a problem there?
2663513	eng	All my problems are over.
2663517	eng	We've got a big problem.
2663518	eng	This is not our problem.
2663519	eng	This could be a problem.
2663525	eng	That would be a problem.
2663526	eng	That might be a problem.
2663527	eng	That could be a problem.
2663529	eng	Like I said, no problem.
2663530	eng	It's not a problem, Tom.
2663532	eng	Is there a problem, Tom?
2663533	eng	Is there a problem here?
2663534	eng	I had the same problems.
2663541	eng	We have a problem here.
2663543	eng	Tom is not the problem.
2663545	eng	Tom had a drug problem.
2663555	eng	I don't have a problem.
2663556	eng	We may have a problem.
2663565	eng	That can be a problem.
2663571	eng	It could be a problem.
2663574	eng	Why is it my problem?
2663577	eng	No one has a problem.
2663583	eng	Is it a big problem?
2663658	eng	There's no harm in looking.
2663659	eng	There's no harm in asking.
2663822	eng	Speaking and writing are different.
2663831	eng	What colour is her hair?
2663843	eng	The train's sound faded away.
2664183	eng	That door cannot be locked.
2664351	eng	Tom has three French dictionaries.
2664419	eng	Are you studying languages, too?
2664609	eng	There is no free lunch.
2664623	eng	Mom, Tom ate my cookie.
2664739	eng	The cat has been eaten.
2664768	eng	Leaf-blowers can cause hearing loss.
2664887	eng	She doesn't close the door.
2664921	eng	I must have a car.
2664951	eng	He robbed the mail coach.
2665011	eng	His injury left him paralyzed.
2665019	eng	This happens all the time.
2665024	eng	He's a snob about wine.
2665026	eng	They had a wine-and-cheese party.
2665135	eng	I would get the analyses.
2665143	eng	Do you believe in miracles?
2665148	eng	Wait, why are you here?
2665162	eng	Tom has two French dictionaries.
2665341	eng	Don't go near the edge.
2665362	eng	Tom is a Mexican immigrant.
2665504	eng	I'm trying to be reasonable.
2665506	eng	Which shoes do you want?
2665509	eng	Let me finish this first.
2665553	eng	I believe in your power.
2665581	eng	Hating someone is so easy.

2666720	eng	Do you have a book?
2666732	eng	Is there a shop here?
2666735	eng	Is there a shop there?
2666783	eng	I want to fuck you.
2667085	eng	We should have done that.
2667091	eng	The hospital is not crowded.
2667094	eng	We really should do that.
2667098	eng	I suddenly needed a car.
2667114	eng	My language is very complicated.
2667132	eng	I desperately need a car.
2667193	eng	You keep me hanging on.
2667211	eng	She died five years ago.
2667316	eng	Tom's wife is called Mary.

2667323	eng	Get up for a moment.
2667333	eng	That's not difficult to do.
2667335	eng	I'll try to arrive early.
2667353	eng	Mary took off her dress.
2667361	eng	These pants don't suit me.
2667367	eng	Mary drives faster than Tom.
2667372	eng	These bananas are not ripe.
2667379	eng	Tom is cheating on Mary.
2667382	eng	Tom's had his house painted.
2667385	eng	I can now die happily.
2667386	eng	Now I can die happy.
2667404	eng	I like trains very much.

2891157	eng	Does that make it clearer?
2891160	eng	Does Tom know about this?
2891163	eng	Does Tom know what happened?
2891169	eng	Everybody got up to leave.
2891171	eng	Everybody knows who Tom is.
2891174	eng	Everyone got up and left.
2891175	eng	Everyone has to go sometime.
2891176	eng	Everyone I know has one.
2891178	eng	Everyone knows Tom is lying.
2891179	eng	Everyone knows who you are.
2891180	eng	Everyone's going to be there.
2891187	eng	Everything will have to go.
2891188	eng	Everything's going to be great.
2891194	eng	Find out what Tom knows.
2891195	eng	Find out who they are.
2891197	eng	Finding Tom won't be easy.
2891199	eng	Get it out of here.
2891200	eng	Get out of my apartment.
2891201	eng	Get out of our house.
2891202	eng	Get out of the house.
2891203	eng	Get out of this car.
2891204	eng	Get out of this house.
2891208	eng	Get up out of bed.
2891223	eng	Hang on just one moment.
2891226	eng	Have you all gone mad?
2891231	eng	Have you thought of that?
2891233	eng	Here's an even better one.
2891234	eng	Here's one of my favorites.
2891239	eng	Hey, where did Tom go?
2891240	eng	Hold on just one second.
2891241	eng	Hold on one second, please.
2891248	eng	How can that be possible?
2891249	eng	How can they do that?
2891250	eng	How can this be happening?
2891253	eng	How can Tom do that?
2891254	eng	How can Tom do this?
2891257	eng	How can we get in?
2891259	eng	How can you be certain?
2891260	eng	How can you be contacted?
2891261	eng	How can you be reached?
2891267	eng	How can you do that?
2891268	eng	How can you do this?
2891271	eng	How can you not remember?
2891274	eng	How did all this start?
2891280	eng	How did they get there?
2891281	eng	How did Tom get away?
2891282	eng	How did Tom get caught?
2891283	eng	How did Tom get home?
2891284	eng	How did Tom get hurt?
2891287	eng	How did Tom get it?
2891291	eng	How did Tom get there?
2891294	eng	How did Tom take it?
2891298	eng	How did you get invited?
2891304	eng	How did you get these?
2891308	eng	How did you get this?
2891332	eng	How did you make contact?
2891354	eng	How does that make sense?
2891359	eng	How long's Tom had it?
2891363	eng	How will you get away?
2891364	eng	How will you get back?
2891365	eng	How will you get home?
2891369	eng	How would we do that?
2891370	eng	How would you know that?
2891373	eng	How're you all doing today?
2891374	eng	How's it going at school?
2891375	eng	How's that going to help?
2891376	eng	How's this going to end?
2891378	eng	I couldn't take that chance.
2891405	eng	I've got a better one.
2891413	eng	If you wish, I'll ask.
2891414	eng	In time, you will understand.
2891417	eng	Is it going to happen?
2891418	eng	Is it time to eat?
2891419	eng	Is it time to go?
2891420	eng	Is it time to leave?
2891424	eng	Is that all it is?
2891425	eng	Is that all it says?
2891426	eng	Is that all it takes?
2891428	eng	Is that all of them?
2891429	eng	Is that all there is?
2891430	eng	Is that all Tom does?
2891431	eng	Is that all you've got?
2891434	eng	Is that one of ours?
2891440	eng	Is that what it takes?
2891441	eng	Is that what people do?
2891443	eng	Is that what Tom says?
2891444	eng	Is that what you feel?
2891445	eng	Is that what you said?
2891464	eng	Is this all of them?
2891465	eng	Is this all there is?
2891466	eng	Is this all they do?
2891467	eng	Is this going to hurt?
2891469	eng	Is this going to work?
2891473	eng	Is Tom about to sing?
2891479	eng	Is Tom in the hospital?
2891481	eng	Is Tom taking it easy?
2891482	eng	Isn't it time for lunch?
2891484	eng	Isn't that what you said?
2891490	eng	It does make a difference.
2891494	eng	It isn't at all clear.
2891498	eng	It must've been someone else.
2891503	eng	It was all Tom's idea.
2891504	eng	It was all your imagination.
2891520	eng	It wasn't made of wood.
2891524	eng	It would be a mistake.
2891533	eng	It would've been so easy.
2891537	eng	It'll take about an hour.
2891542	eng	It's a real good one.
2891543	eng	It's all been a waste.
2891545	eng	It's all for the best.
2891548	eng	It's all in the file.
2891549	eng	It's all in the report.
2891550	eng	It's all in the room.
2891551	eng	It's all in this file.
2891563	eng	It's been known to happen.
2891566	eng	It's been there a while.
2891567	eng	It's done all the time.
2891569	eng	It's going to be amazing.
2891570	eng	It's going to be beautiful.
2891571	eng	It's going to be brutal.
2891572	eng	It's going to be close.
2891573	eng	It's going to be closed.
2891574	eng	It's going to be easy.
2891575	eng	It's going to be embarrassing.
2891577	eng	It's going to be good.
2891578	eng	It's going to be huge.
2891579	eng	It's going to be OK.
2891580	eng	It's going to be packed.
2891581	eng	It's going to be painful.
2891582	eng	It's going to be perfect.
2891583	eng	It's going to be tight.
2891584	eng	It's going to be weird.
2891587	eng	It's going to get worse.
2891594	eng	It's like one of those.
2891600	eng	It's not all that great.
2891601	eng	It's not all that ridiculous.
2891608	eng	It's not going to happen.
2891612	eng	It's not going to work.
2891622	eng	It's not something you forget.
2891626	eng	It's not up to you.
2891629	eng	It's one of our rules.
2891630	eng	It's out of my hands.
2891631	eng	It's out of our hands.
2891635	eng	It's somewhere in this room.
2891639	eng	It's time for a change.
2891642	eng	It's time for my break.
2891646	eng	It's time to get going.
2891647	eng	It's time to get ready.
2891648	eng	It's time to go now.
2891656	eng	It's totally up to you.
2891658	eng	It's up to them now.
2891661	eng	It's up to you now.
2891662	eng	It's up to you, Tom.
2891665	eng	It's you who are confused.
2891666	eng	Just do me one favor.
2891669	eng	Just get out of there.
2891673	eng	Just take it easy, OK?
2891680	eng	Keep Tom out of here.
2891681	eng	Keep Tom out of trouble.
2891682	eng	Learn what you can learn.
2891684	eng	Let go of my son.
2891685	eng	Let me out of here.
2891689	eng	Let's get the other one.
2891694	eng	Let's talk about it later.
2891699	eng	Look at all these flowers.
2891700	eng	Look at that one there.
2891702	eng	Look what we have here.
2891705	eng	Mary is a lovely woman.
2891708	eng	Maybe I'll have to wait.
2891716	eng	Men are all the same.
2891720	eng	My middle name is Tom.
2891725	eng	Neither one of them disagrees.
2891727	eng	No one can do anything.
2891731	eng	No one can say anything.
2891734	eng	No one had seen anything.
2891735	eng	No one has an answer.
2891736	eng	No one has an explanation.
2891738	eng	No one has been murdered.
2891740	eng	No one has that right.
2891741	eng	No one has the answer.
2891742	eng	No one is doing anything.
2891750	eng	No one is that lucky.
2891753	eng	No one is to leave.
2891757	eng	No one knows we're here.
2891759	eng	No one saw a thing.
2891763	eng	No one was with me.
2891764	eng	No one will be hurt.
2891765	eng	No one will help us.
2891767	eng	No one will see us.
2891768	eng	Nobody can be that lucky.
2891776	eng	Nothing will be the same.
2891777	eng	Nothing's going to go wrong.
2891785	eng	Now we can be together.
2891787	eng	Now we'll have some fun.
2891789	eng	Now what do we do?
2891794	eng	People are going to die.
2891795	eng	People can be so rude.
2891797	eng	Perhaps that would be possible.
2891801	eng	Perhaps you should get one.
2891813	eng	Please take your seat, sir.
2891818	eng	Pull up to the curb.
2891822	eng	Roll up your sleeve, please.
2891830	eng	See what you can find.
2891831	eng	Should we get a table?
2891837	eng	Shouldn't we get our stuff?
2891840	eng	Shouldn't we try to help?
2891842	eng	Shouldn't you be in bed?
2891843	eng	Shut up and do it.
2891850	eng	So, what do you think?
2891853	eng	Somebody is or was here.
2891855	eng	Somebody's got to do it.
2891856	eng	Somebody's got to do something.
2891860	eng	Someone is going to notice.
2891865	eng	Spend some time with me.
2891867	eng	Stay out of my business.
2891868	eng	Stay out of my kitchen.
2891869	eng	Stay out of this, Tom.
2891877	eng	Take Tom out of here.
2891878	eng	Take your time with it.
2891880	eng	Tell him who you are.
2891884	eng	Tell Tom I'll do it.
2891887	eng	Tell us about your brother.
2891888	eng	Tell us all about it.
2891889	eng	Tell us all the gossip.
2891894	eng	Thank you one and all.
2891896	eng	Thanks to all of you.
2891899	eng	That isn't going to happen.
2891900	eng	That isn't going to help.
2891906	eng	That probably wouldn't be appropriate.
2891909	eng	That was a good one.
2891922	eng	That wasn't there this morning.
2891924	eng	That will not be difficult.
2891925	eng	That will not be necessary.
2891926	eng	That will not be permitted.
2891927	eng	That will not be possible.
2891931	eng	That would be a challenge.
2891932	eng	That would be a change.
2891933	eng	That would be a pity.
2891934	eng	That would be a relief.
2891935	eng	That would be a shame.
2891936	eng	That would be a tragedy.
2891939	eng	That would be all right.
2891941	eng	That would be an improvement.
2891942	eng	That would be an understatement.
2891957	eng	That would be illegal, right?
2891965	eng	That would be one reason.
2891966	eng	That would be one theory.
2891970	eng	That would be so awkward.
2891984	eng	That would do the trick.
2891988	eng	That would not be appropriate.
2891989	eng	That would not be easy.
2891990	eng	That would not be wise.
2892006	eng	That's a very interesting one.
2892008	eng	That's all in the past.
2892009	eng	That's all it takes sometimes.
2892022	eng	That's all we can ask.
2892023	eng	That's all we do here.
2892026	eng	That's all you can do.
2892028	eng	That's exactly what I need.
2892029	eng	That's exactly what Tom needs.
2892030	eng	That's exactly what we need.
2892031	eng	That's going to be difficult.
2892032	eng	That's going to be tough.
2892033	eng	That's going to take forever.
2892034	eng	That's going to take time.
2892035	eng	That's got to be painful.
2892036	eng	That's got to be uncomfortable.
2892044	eng	That's not going to work.
2892049	eng	That's not something you forget.
2892050	eng	That's not what it means.
2892051	eng	That's not what that means.
2892052	eng	That's not what that was.
2892053	eng	That's not what they're after.
2892055	eng	That's not what we did.
2892057	eng	That's one of my concerns.
2892058	eng	That's one of my favorites.
2892059	eng	That's one of our rules.
2892061	eng	That's one of the reasons.
2892067	eng	That's the one we want.
2892073	eng	That's what I've been avoiding.
2892074	eng	That's what I've been doing.
2892075	eng	That's what I've been saying.
2892084	eng	That's what Tom was hiding.
2892085	eng	That's what we all thought.
2892086	eng	That's what we do best.
2892087	eng	That's what we do here.
2892093	eng	That's what we were thinking.
2892096	eng	That's what you all say.
2892098	eng	That's what you do best.
2892100	eng	That's what you said yesterday.
2892103	eng	That's what you would think.
2892106	eng	The game's about to begin.
2892107	eng	The meeting's about to start.
2892113	eng	There are people out there.
2892128	eng	There isn't time for that.
2892130	eng	There isn't time to explain.
2892132	eng	There was more than one.
2892136	eng	There will be an investigation.
2892148	eng	There's only room for one.
2892152	eng	There's someone in the backyard.
2892153	eng	There's someone in the basement.
2892162	eng	There's something on your back.
2892163	eng	There's something on your neck.
2892165	eng	These people are our guests.
2892167	eng	They were in perfect health.
2892169	eng	They're not going to stop.
2892182	eng	This has got to stop.
2892184	eng	This is all a conspiracy.
2892185	eng	This is all a mistake.
2892186	eng	This is all a misunderstanding.
2892188	eng	This is all so complicated.
2892189	eng	This is all so strange.
2892190	eng	This is all Tom's fault.
2892204	eng	This is getting us nowhere.
2892224	eng	This is going to happen.
2892225	eng	This is going to hurt.
2892232	eng	This is not going well.
2892233	eng	This is not so bad.
2892236	eng	This is one of mine.
2892255	eng	This is the best one.
2892256	eng	This is the big one.
2892257	eng	This is the free one.
2892258	eng	This is the last one.
2892259	eng	This is what Tom feared.
2892260	eng	This is what Tom wants.
2892262	eng	This is your one chance.
2892267	eng	This isn't getting us anywhere.
2892271	eng	This isn't what Tom expected.
2892272	eng	This isn't what we planned.
2892279	eng	This one wasn't your mistake.
2892280	eng	This one will be fine.
2892282	eng	This time you were lucky.
2892284	eng	This was all a misunderstanding.
2892285	eng	This was in Tom's safe.
2892290	eng	This will have to do.
2892292	eng	This will take some time.
2892299	eng	Tom closed his eyes tightly.
2892302	eng	Tom entered the bedroom quietly.
2892303	eng	Tom entered the building unnoticed.
2892307	eng	Tom had a perfect record.
2892309	eng	Tom hanged himself in jail.
2892310	eng	Tom hanged himself last night.
2892311	eng	Tom has a law degree.
2892316	eng	Tom is a law student.
2892318	eng	Tom is a public defender.
2892319	eng	Tom is a public official.
2892320	eng	Tom is about my age.
2892322	eng	Tom is clever and ambitious.
2892328	eng	Tom is in perfect condition.
2892335	eng	Tom is perfect for you.
2892341	eng	Tom knew what to say.
2892348	eng	Tom knows what it's about.
2892349	eng	Tom knows what you need.
2892358	eng	Tom put his notebook away.
2892360	eng	Tom reached for his drink.
2892365	eng	Tom ripped up the note.
2892376	eng	Tom was a potato farmer.
2892377	eng	Tom was a public servant.
2892384	eng	Tom will know something's wrong.
2892385	eng	Tom, can you take over?
2892387	eng	Tom's house was completely destroyed.
2892394	eng	Tonight's going to be fun.
2892395	eng	Tonight's going to be perfect.
2892396	eng	Try and get some sleep.
2892399	eng	Unfortunately, I'll have to pass.
2892401	eng	Wait a minute, will you?
2892404	eng	Wait till Tom gets here.
2892413	eng	Was there a time limit?
2892420	eng	We can't all be perfect.
2892421	eng	We do have one advantage.
2892423	eng	We need to protect ourselves.
2892424	eng	We want a complete evaluation.
2892433	eng	We're not going in there.
2892434	eng	We're perfect for each other.
2892439	eng	Were you one of them?
2892440	eng	Were you thinking about me?
2892445	eng	What are they up to?
2892458	eng	What are you all doing?
2892481	eng	What are you people thinking?
2892482	eng	What are you thinking now?
2892488	eng	What can all that mean?
2892499	eng	What can you do now?
2892509	eng	What did you do next?
2892511	eng	What did you get exactly?
2892530	eng	What do you have here?
2892543	eng	What do you think happened?
2892593	eng	What have we got here?
2892598	eng	What have you got there?
2892600	eng	What is all that stuff?
2892602	eng	What is all this stuff?
2892603	eng	What is Tom to you?
2892605	eng	What made you so sure?
2892606	eng	What made you think that?
2892607	eng	What makes it so unique?
2892608	eng	What makes this one special?
2892609	eng	What makes this so different?
2892610	eng	What makes Tom so special?
2892612	eng	What makes you so special?
2892613	eng	What makes you so sure?
2892629	eng	What time is it anyway?
2892633	eng	What was all this about?
2892637	eng	What was that all about?
2892638	eng	What was this all about?
2892642	eng	What were you thinking of?
2892646	eng	What would be the point?
2892652	eng	What would you do now?
2892653	eng	What would you have done?
2892655	eng	What would you say then?
2892657	eng	What you did took courage.

3248433	eng	All she does is gossip.
3248438	eng	I lost patience with him.
3248474	eng	I'm so glad you came!
3248527	eng	Did I really do that?
3248530	eng	Tom's a very gregarious person.
3248541	eng	You don't need my permission.
3248565	eng	I tried to warn him.
3248566	eng	I tried to warn her.

3250958	eng	Tom is moody at times.
3250967	eng	Tom has only one squirrel.
3250968	eng	It's because you're a girl.
3250969	eng	It's because you're a guy.

3258969	eng	We need to smile often.
3259000	eng	At the crossroads, turn left.
3259105	eng	Get off the train immediately.
3259117	eng	My father was an engineer.
3259148	eng	That man is completely drunk.
3259150	eng	Have you ever eaten oysters?
3259220	eng	He slept until ten o'clock.

3259250	eng	I see her every day.
3259254	eng	Which one are you bringing?
3259281	eng	Start reading at line thirteen.

3259320	eng	It is a luxury cruise.
3259330	eng	Is Miss Dupont absent today?
3259338	eng	I can't help you now.
3259356	eng	You eat well in France.

3259433	eng	This restaurant is less expensive.
3259447	eng	Let's go to the mountains.

3259745	eng	He's afraid of the dog.
3259779	eng	What are you complaining about?
3259808	eng	The rain waters the flowers.

3264688	eng	Is that a new jacket?
3264689	eng	This is my new guitar.
3264691	eng	Is that your new book?
3264692	eng	Is that a new perfume?

3264709	eng	Tom hired a new secretary.
3264712	eng	Are you the new secretary?
3264713	eng	Are you the new assistant?
3264719	eng	That's hardly a new concept.
3264739	eng	They've hired some new workers.
3264740	eng	There's no new information yet.
3264747	eng	Congratulations on your new job.
3265501	eng	The movers didn't break anything.
3265784	eng	He built the doghouse himself.
3265804	eng	My house is under construction.
3266027	eng	Tom is near the newsstand.
3266439	eng	The world is changing rapidly.
3266474	eng	It's time to say okay.
3266612	eng	We have made him cry.
3266834	eng	Please give me a hug.
3267230	eng	Am I the only one?
3267308	eng	Tom's life began falling apart.
3267380	eng	He is kind of bald.
3267706	eng	Ask her to call me.
3267707	eng	Ask them to call me.
3267732	eng	She is crazy about me.
3267782	eng	We are on our own.
3267793	eng	Let me have the picture.
3268076	eng	It's as clear as mud.

3270223	eng	There are very beautiful women.
3270598	eng	Tom's a friend of his.
3270672	eng	Cooking is my secret passion.
3270887	eng	How many inhabitants are there?
3270907	eng	He never brushes his teeth.
3270921	eng	He missed an important appointment.
3270946	eng	I don't understand Hungarian, sorry.
3271000	eng	We support the environmentalists completely.
3271002	eng	We looked around the property.
3271048	eng	She's following a get-fit programme.
3271054	eng	She had a narrow escape.

3271077	eng	It's a novel by Zola.
3271089	eng	I have only one sister.
3271216	eng	I missed my favourite series.
3271320	eng	You should see the film.
3271357	eng	You must have lost them.
3271403	eng	You look a sorry sight.
3271407	eng	You decide! It's your future!
3271473	eng	Why is that road blocked?
3271479	eng	Why doesn't he tell them?
3271488	eng	Who says it isn't fixed?
3271494	eng	Where are we going tomorrow?
3271527	eng	What's important is the result.
3271565	eng	What is her shoe size?
3271567	eng	What is his shoe size?
3271576	eng	What has become of you?
3271727	eng	What did he say again?
3271761	eng	We would have helped them.
3271779	eng	We thought you were sick.
3271785	eng	We should trust the experts.
3271791	eng	We received letters this morning.
3271908	eng	We bought her a necklace.
3271936	eng	This laptop belongs to me.
3272044	eng	They went to bed late.
3272059	eng	They started picking up stones.
3272061	eng	They should work on Monday.
3272065	eng	They should cost about €100.
3272138	eng	They made me really angry.
3272142	eng	They like to stay informed.
3272148	eng	They have only one option.
3272152	eng	They had to meet Jacques.
3272154	eng	They had no more electricity.
3272166	eng	They don't sell phone credit.
3272175	eng	They completely forgot the meeting.
3272239	eng	They belong to an association.
3272245	eng	They are worrying about nothing.
3272270	eng	There's nothing much to buy.
3272276	eng	There's not much to visit.
3272304	eng	The team left at eight.
3272345	eng	The phone belongs to you?
3272375	eng	The inquiry did not conclude.
3272407	eng	The book belongs to Paul.
3272421	eng	That would not suit us.
3272453	eng	That should last three weeks.
3272482	eng	Tell them about your holidays!
3272486	eng	Did you get your receipt?
3272492	eng	Sophie and Carole are exhausted.
3272498	eng	She's starting to annoy me.
3272510	eng	She's just skipped French class.
3272569	eng	She went to bed early.
3272585	eng	She turned on the TV.

3272724	eng	She can't find her keys.
3272726	eng	She can say that again!
3272746	eng	Put them on the table.
3272748	eng	Paul bought them a gift.
3272752	eng	Our concert has been postponed.
3272777	eng	No girl dares approach him.
3272787	eng	My friend almost went abroad.
3272829	eng	May she take that chair?
3273057	eng	Is there a supermarket nearby?
3273133	eng	I'll start revising next week.
3273183	eng	I'm convinced you'll love it.
3273224	eng	I'd like some sugar, please.

3273516	eng	He left her all alone.
3273574	eng	He had to go there.
3273600	eng	He didn't intervene? But why?
3273611	eng	He comes home at ten.
3273613	eng	He can't do everything himself.
3273615	eng	He can explain the situation.
3273633	eng	Have you seen Paul today?
3273687	eng	Go and get the boss!
3273691	eng	Give him back the ball!
3273700	eng	Everything should be in order.

3273793	eng	Do they have their suitcase?
3273807	eng	Did he get a receipt?
3273834	eng	Come back and see me!
3273887	eng	As long ago as that?!
3273921	eng	About twenty people were injured.
3274390	eng	Did you cut your hair?
3275653	eng	He came across a wolf.
3276018	eng	I bought a used truck.
3276058	eng	What else do they need?
3276502	eng	I was born in China.
3277267	eng	How did you meet Tom?
3277290	eng	Lorry is good at swimming.

3279443	eng	Can we speak French instead?
3279445	eng	Could we speak French instead?
3279725	eng	That's exactly what I meant.
3280075	eng	I'm in no particular hurry.
3280096	eng	Tom doesn't seem particularly worried.

3280391	eng	Did Tom ever mention Mary?
3280392	eng	Did I not mention that?
3280420	eng	Do it whenever you want.

3281678	eng	Come on, you're wasting time.
3281679	eng	You're just wasting your time.
3281686	eng	Tom seems pretty wasted already.
3281687	eng	We've already wasted enough time.
3281756	eng	This scientific theory is controversial.
3281766	eng	This is a low-calorie muffin.
3281784	eng	I want to punch him.
3281793	eng	She copies everything I do.
3281794	eng	He copies everything I do.
3281923	eng	I know you love him.
3282164	eng	The bell rings at 8:00.
3282630	eng	I don't like his hat.
3282631	eng	I don't like her hat.
3282952	eng	I tried to stop him.
3282953	eng	I tried to stop her.
3282992	eng	It's very cold this winter!
3282997	eng	Never forget who you are!
3283011	eng	This is unacceptable to me.
3283019	eng	This rope is very weak.
3283021	eng	Thank you for the support.
3283423	eng	Don't worry. I'll be fine.
3283822	eng	They don't want you here.
3283826	eng	They asked me to leave.
3283840	eng	I don't want them here.
3283850	eng	You're only just in time.
3284048	eng	The musicians acknowledge the applause.
3284090	eng	He looked at her eagerly.
3284098	eng	At least you have options.
3284211	eng	Tom readily admits his mistakes.
3284299	eng	Suggestions for improvements are welcomed.
3286210	eng	Do you like red wine?
3286805	eng	Tom has nothing to do.
3286809	eng	Tom saw nothing at all.
3286815	eng	It meant nothing to me.
3286816	eng	It means nothing to me.
3286817	eng	I've got nothing to do.
3286819	eng	You have nothing I want.
3286820	eng	Was it something I said?
3286827	eng	Let me put something on.
3286828	eng	It's nothing we can use.
3286836	eng	We have to try something.
3286838	eng	Tom, can I say something?
3286839	eng	This means nothing to me.
3286840	eng	Think nothing more of it.
3286846	eng	There was nothing to see.
3286847	eng	There was nothing to say.
3286848	eng	That means nothing to me.
3286852	eng	It meant something to me.
3286853	eng	It has to mean something.
3286854	eng	I don't owe Tom anything.
3286856	eng	You have something I want.
3286857	eng	We've got nothing to lose.
3286858	eng	We've got nothing to hide.
3286859	eng	Tom's got nothing to lose.
3286860	eng	Tom's got nothing to hide.
3286861	eng	Tom has something we want.
3286870	eng	Let's go do something fun.
3286871	eng	Let me try something else.
3286872	eng	It's not something I'd do.
3286873	eng	It won't cost us anything.
3286875	eng	I think I heard something.
3286876	eng	Do you two know something?
3286877	eng	Did we run over something?
3286878	eng	Can we try something else?
3286880	eng	We've got nothing to prove.
3286883	eng	There's nothing you can do.
3286884	eng	There's nothing Tom can do.
3286888	eng	There's nothing left to do.
3286895	eng	Is something wrong with me?
3286896	eng	Is something wrong with it?
3286897	eng	I've got nothing to report.
3286899	eng	I forgot to pack something.
3286900	eng	Do you need something else?
3286901	eng	Did you see something else?
3286902	eng	Did Tom do something wrong?
3286903	eng	Am I doing something wrong?
3286904	eng	You're nothing but a coward.
3286905	eng	We've got nothing in common.
3286906	eng	Tom's got something we want.
3286907	eng	Tom said he found something.
3286908	eng	Tom is choking on something.
3286909	eng	Tom is busy doing something.
3286911	eng	There's nothing we can't do.
3286912	eng	There's nothing they can do.
3286913	eng	There's nothing more to eat.
3286914	eng	There's nothing left to say.
3286915	eng	There's nothing here for us.
3286916	eng	There's nothing else to say.
3286917	eng	There's nothing else to eat.
3286918	eng	Nothing seems to be missing.
3286922	eng	Did you want something, Tom?
3286923	eng	Did you need something else?
3286927	eng	We must be missing something.
3286928	eng	We haven't done anything yet.
3286930	eng	Tom is doing something there.
3286931	eng	They've got something for us.
3286935	eng	There's nothing on the table.
3286936	eng	There's nothing in this room.
3286937	eng	There's nothing in the trunk.
3286938	eng	There's nothing here for you.
3286939	eng	There's nothing for you here.
3286942	eng	There may be something there.
3286944	eng	That might lead to something.
3286946	eng	Maybe something will turn up.
3286947	eng	Let's hope we find something.
3286948	eng	It's nothing that can't wait.
3286955	eng	Is something wrong with that?
3286956	eng	I haven't found anything yet.
3286958	eng	Could I say something, please?
3286960	eng	Are you sure nothing's wrong?
3286961	eng	You're always up to something.
3286962	eng	We'll think of something else.
3286964	eng	Tom said he'd found something.
3286966	eng	They're going to do something.
3286969	eng	They didn't offer me anything.
3286970	eng	There's something in this box.
3286972	eng	There's nothing more to drink.
3286974	eng	There's nothing left to drink.
3286975	eng	There's nothing in the fridge.
3286976	eng	There's nothing in the bucket.
3286978	eng	There's nothing else to drink.
3286980	eng	That's something I'd never do.
3286982	eng	So far, they've found nothing.
3286983	eng	Please show us something else.
3286984	eng	Please show me something else.
3286988	eng	It's not something we planned.
3286989	eng	It might be something serious.
3286996	eng	Aren't you scared of anything?
3286997	eng	Aren't you afraid of anything?
3287001	eng	Well, it's better than nothing.
3287002	eng	We shouldn't tell Tom anything.
3287006	eng	We aren't doing anything wrong.
3287008	eng	There's something under my bed.
3287015	eng	There's nothing in this drawer.
3287016	eng	There's nothing in this closet.
3287017	eng	There's nothing funny going on.
3287023	eng	Someone ought to say something.
3287026	eng	It's better than doing nothing.
3287039	eng	Finally, we agree on something.
3287042	eng	Did you actually see something?
3287049	eng	Tom knew something wasn't right.
3287054	eng	There's nothing more to discuss.
3287057	eng	There's nothing left to discuss.
3287061	eng	There's nothing else to discuss.
3287066	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't want anything.
3287070	eng	I think we're missing something.
3287085	eng	Tom's very upset about something.
3287092	eng	There's nothing strange about it.
3287096	eng	That's something I can't control.
3287098	eng	Maybe there's something I missed.
3287117	eng	There's something Tom should know.
3287121	eng	There's something else over there.
3287122	eng	There's nothing worse than hunger.
3287124	eng	There's nothing unusual to report.
3287129	eng	Maybe there's something we missed.
3287141	eng	We're talking about something else.
3287146	eng	There's something strange going on.
3287160	eng	It smells like something's rotting.
3287161	eng	It smells like something's burning.
3287164	eng	Is there something bothering you?
3287177	eng	Were you planning something special?
3287184	eng	There's something moving down there.
3287209	eng	Did I interrupt something important?
3287251	eng	There's nothing worse than loneliness.
3287258	eng	That's something worth thinking about.
3287270	eng	Am I interrupting something important?
3287287	eng	That's something you should understand.
3287309	eng	There's something definitely wrong here.
3287315	eng	There's definitely something wrong here.
3287351	eng	Maybe that's something worth considering.
3288267	eng	I didn't recognize the tune.
3289174	eng	Osaka is larger than Kyoto.
3289238	eng	What do we live for?
3289245	eng	Who do I live for?
3289246	eng	What do I live for?
3289388	eng	I buy newspapers every day.
3289539	eng	My grandmother is very old.
3289842	eng	It may rain before long.
3290042	eng	Tom has requested our help.
3290747	eng	Namibia is an African state.
3290766	eng	I need to sleep now.
3290775	eng	She has a swimming pool.
3291305	eng	Tom's starting to go bald.
3291515	eng	Knowledge is the supreme goal.
3291519	eng	That is knowledge which liberates.
3291524	eng	Knowledge is the supreme power.
3291528	eng	Without effort, nothing is possible.
3291532	eng	Touching the sky with glory.
3292152	eng	Did you already do that?
3292215	eng	I don't have a wife.
3292231	eng	I don't like anything here.
3292401	eng	Why are you so mysterious?
3292486	eng	I'll take some of that.
3292844	eng	He doesn't have any freckles.
3293462	eng	Not bad for a beginner.
3293492	eng	I always take the bus.
3293539	eng	The queen is mentally incapacitated.
3293688	eng	I like listening to him.
3293742	eng	There's no reason to complain.
3293888	eng	He was born in Mexico.
3294461	eng	I went into the house.
3294488	eng	I got on the horse.
3294847	eng	The bottle broke on me.
3294984	eng	A penguin colony lives there.
3295102	eng	This squirrel is not shy.
3295135	eng	The most dangerous inmate escaped.
3295245	eng	She was clearly in trouble.
3295257	eng	He was clearly in trouble.
3295376	eng	The scientists analyzed the data.
3295518	eng	I don't think that's fair.
3295519	eng	Mary has sandy blonde hair.
3295532	eng	I'm 99% sure it's true.
3297283	eng	She found him a spot.
3297452	eng	Absolute truth does not exist.
3297602	eng	Tom didn't seem that happy.
3298187	eng	Cooee! Can you hear me?
3298383	eng	Don't you dare leave me!
3298815	eng	Good things are easily spoiled.
3299481	eng	Tom watched the team practice.
3299579	eng	It will be over soon.
3299591	eng	Tom will never betray us.
3299619	eng	You throw like a girl.
3299624	eng	It was a counterintuitive event.
3299671	eng	I am reading his book.
3299701	eng	Don't you ever do that!
3299735	eng	Why would I be jealous?
3300120	eng	I needn't buy a car.
3300125	eng	Why did you go home?
3300207	eng	Tom, please just shut up.
3300287	eng	Stop now or I'll scream!
3300288	eng	Stop it or I'll scream!
3300290	eng	Please help me. I'm dying.
3300308	eng	He'll be arriving any moment.
3300309	eng	They'll be arriving any moment.
3300334	eng	I don't care. I'm hungry.
3300479	eng	Promise me you won't go.
3300535	eng	Please just calm down, okay?
3300563	eng	Don't do that ever again!
3300653	eng	She never listens to me.
3300679	eng	Stop spinning in that chair!
3300686	eng	He never listens to me.
3300753	eng	Do what your mother said.
3300981	eng	This necktie is too expensive.
3300983	eng	Do you believe in angels?
3300987	eng	That tie is too expensive.
3301001	eng	I don't know anybody here.
3301162	eng	Whaat? No, of course not.
3302536	eng	Houston, we have a problem.
3302548	eng	Do you see anyone here?
3302611	eng	Tom is nuts about squirrels.
3302741	eng	I have much work today.
3302763	eng	This concept has many meanings.
3302808	eng	It's dark in this room.
3302839	eng	Tari Ito was found guilty.
3302844	eng	It will shortly stop raining.
3302979	eng	The parcel was delivered yesterday.
3302981	eng	Please lend me ten cents.
3303223	eng	Your friend left the city.
3303224	eng	Does Mary really love me?
3303531	eng	I don't drink their water.
3303721	eng	He's not gifted at sports.
3303811	eng	The kids are at school.
3303812	eng	My husband is at work.
3303898	eng	Stop trying to control me!
3303913	eng	He gently took her hand.
3303918	eng	This is what friends do.
3303938	eng	You're so full of it.
3303940	eng	Tom, please leave me alone.
3303980	eng	She faked her own death.
3303981	eng	He faked his own death.
3304010	eng	I'm glad you came today.
3304044	eng	Tom has a hidden agenda.
3304934	eng	Mary is intelligent and kind.
3304944	eng	There was no hot water.
3304946	eng	She gave him the creeps.
3305144	eng	I speak Esperanto very poorly.
3305370	eng	The little girl washed herself.
3305387	eng	I want to learn Tigrinya.
3305854	eng	Tom, wake up! We're late!
3305870	eng	You dragged me into this!
3305871	eng	No, Tom, don't do that.
3305878	eng	Why don't you ask him?
3305879	eng	Why don't you ask her?
3305884	eng	My head is killing me.
3305895	eng	I love everything about you.
3305897	eng	We were all children once.
3305898	eng	Do you find him attractive?
3305899	eng	Do you find her attractive?
3305956	eng	You are a notorious liar.
3305962	eng	Tom is not in hospital.
3306092	eng	I have an Asus laptop.
3306918	eng	Have you visited Tokyo Tower?
3307007	eng	What's this hotel's fax number?
3307095	eng	Does it have any sense?
3307252	eng	Everybody was staring at me.
3307254	eng	Everybody was staring at him.
3307255	eng	Everybody was staring at her.
3307307	eng	Why are squirrels so cute?
3307309	eng	Everything has to be perfect.
3307317	eng	Everything had to be perfect.
3307434	eng	Tom, don't worry. I'm alright.
3307525	eng	All those things are true.
3307547	eng	Something wicked this way comes.
3307711	eng	The problem is not this.
3308092	eng	Most problems have many solutions.
3308232	eng	Can I get a picture?
3308234	eng	Get a picture of this.
3308235	eng	I sent Tom my picture.
3308240	eng	Here's a picture of me.
3308242	eng	Here's a picture of Tom.
3308243	eng	I'll send you a picture.
3308244	eng	Let me see the pictures.
3308246	eng	This is a great picture.
3308247	eng	Tom showed me a picture.
3308251	eng	Tom is drawing a picture.
3308253	eng	Tom is painting a picture.
3308254	eng	Tom isn't in this picture.
3308257	eng	Tom showed me his picture.
3308260	eng	Look at this picture again.
3308263	eng	Tom tore Mary's picture up.
3308267	eng	Tom showed us some pictures.
3308271	eng	Tom showed me Mary's picture.
3308278	eng	Tom took thousands of pictures.
3308289	eng	I'm downloading the pictures now.
3308379	eng	It's not a pretty picture.
3308380	eng	Is Tom in the picture?
3308389	eng	OK, I get the picture.
3308546	eng	They're talking about you, Tom.
3308547	eng	They're talking about you, Mary.
3308631	eng	They sat in a semi-circle.
3308643	eng	You have a poor memory!
3308766	eng	What happened to the girl?
3308767	eng	I loved him so much.
3308881	eng	Pashto is an interesting language.
3309015	eng	That's a big fat lie.
3309016	eng	Tom is short and fat.
3309017	eng	That's why I'm so fat.
3309018	eng	You sure got fat fast.
3309020	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom's fat.
3309204	eng	It was a significant moment.
3309206	eng	This is a significant change.
3309209	eng	That's a significant step forward.
3309210	eng	There is no significant difference.
3309216	eng	Tom's French has improved significantly.
3309269	eng	The whole world knows that.
3309702	eng	I have a Japanese car.
3309756	eng	Let's stick to the plan.
3309758	eng	You'll have a great time.
3309905	eng	We've come to get you.
3309909	eng	We've all heard about you.
3309910	eng	We've been waiting on you.
3309911	eng	We've been waiting for you.
3309912	eng	We've done fine without you.
3309915	eng	We've been searching for you.

3309951	eng	We've looked everywhere, haven't we?
3309952	eng	We've come a long way.
3309955	eng	We've got plenty of water.
3309956	eng	We've got to conserve water.
3309957	eng	We've got a search warrant.
3309968	eng	We've got to call Tom.
3309969	eng	We've got to find Tom.
3309970	eng	We've got to stop Tom.
3309972	eng	We've got to rescue Tom.

3309991	eng	We've run out of time.
3309992	eng	We've got very little time.
3309998	eng	We've got to share this.
3309999	eng	We've already been through this.
3310002	eng	We've come for Tom's things.
3310007	eng	We've got to find them.
3310008	eng	We've got to help them.
3310009	eng	We've got to stop them.
3310011	eng	We've taken care of that.
3310012	eng	We've made allowances for that.
3310020	eng	We've got the house surrounded.
3310021	eng	We've brought you a surprise.
3310029	eng	We've got a little situation.
3310030	eng	We've been together ever since.
3310034	eng	We've got patients to see.
3310035	eng	We've made a thorough search.
3310037	eng	We've got to make sacrifices.
3310038	eng	We've all heard the rumors.
3310039	eng	We've been down that road.
3310040	eng	We've been down this road.
3310042	eng	We've just got to relax.
3310045	eng	We've got to get ready.
3310046	eng	We've got to be quiet.
3310049	eng	We've been having some problems.
3310050	eng	We've got a bigger problem.
3310051	eng	We've got a little problem.
3310053	eng	We've got a mechanical problem.

3312779	eng	We weren't involved in that.
3312781	eng	We can't just ignore that.
3312785	eng	We left soon after that.
3312787	eng	We can deal with that.
3312788	eng	We can live with that.
3312791	eng	Are we clear on that?
3312792	eng	We can still do that.
3312796	eng	We need to fix that.
3312807	eng	We made quite a team.
3312808	eng	We made a good team.
3312811	eng	We think we'll be successful.
3312813	eng	We should probably get started.
3312816	eng	We'd better find it soon.
3312818	eng	We need to rest soon.
3312820	eng	We may need it soon.
3312824	eng	We all know you're smart.
3312827	eng	We dated in high school.
3312828	eng	We did it in school.
3312830	eng	We make our own rules.
3312831	eng	We took the quickest route.
3312832	eng	We shouldn't take the risk.
3312837	eng	We should let Tom rest.
3312838	eng	We can be held responsible.
3312840	eng	We came here to relax.
3312841	eng	We went to the races.
3312843	eng	We had to leave quickly.
3312846	eng	We had a little problem.
3312847	eng	We still have a problem.
3312849	eng	We took the usual precautions.
3312853	eng	We'd better get in position.
3312857	eng	We still need a plan.
3312858	eng	We found the perfect place.
3312859	eng	We can order a pizza.
3312864	eng	We got a standing ovation.
3312868	eng	We can move everything out.
3312869	eng	We'd better check it out.
3312870	eng	We can work this out.
3312877	eng	We could help each other.
3312878	eng	We still have each other.
3312879	eng	We can help each other.
3312880	eng	We can see each other.
3312881	eng	We were only following orders.
3312883	eng	We want a second opinion.
3312884	eng	We heard the door open.
3312885	eng	We only went out once.
3312886	eng	We only did it once.
3312890	eng	We still have an obligation.
3312898	eng	We should be going now.
3312899	eng	We can't do this now.
3312901	eng	We can help Tom now.
3312904	eng	We got robbed last night.
3312905	eng	We were there last night.
3312908	eng	We could watch a movie.
3312909	eng	We've been waiting all morning.
3312910	eng	We found it this morning.
3312913	eng	We dated for three months.
3312915	eng	We could use the money.
3312916	eng	We ran out of money.
3312920	eng	We just need thirty minutes.
3312921	eng	We just need a minute.
3312925	eng	We used to be married.
3312926	eng	We may still get lucky.
3312931	eng	We all cried a lot.
3312932	eng	We'd better take a look.
3312933	eng	We weren't gone that long.
3312934	eng	We can't wait that long.
3312937	eng	We should wait a little.
3312942	eng	We've got three days left.
3312944	eng	We can go shopping later.
3312945	eng	We can try again later.
3312946	eng	We may need it later.
3312949	eng	We're running a little late.
3312951	eng	We were almost too late.
3312952	eng	We may be too late.
3312968	eng	We should think about it.
3312971	eng	We just can't find it.
3312972	eng	We can deal with it.
3312979	eng	We know Tom did it.
3312980	eng	We made sure of it.
3312981	eng	We need to test it.
3312993	eng	We made some bad investments.
3312995	eng	We should get more information.
3312999	eng	We'd better go back in.
3313002	eng	We saw you come in.
3313007	eng	We still have three hours.
3313008	eng	We leave in three hours.
3313010	eng	We can all walk home.
3313011	eng	We can take a hint.
3313026	eng	We can't leave Tom here.
3313027	eng	We know you're in here.
3313028	eng	We need some help here.
3313029	eng	We need help in here.
3313030	eng	We need help up here.
3313031	eng	We used to live here.
3313032	eng	We know Tom is here.
3313036	eng	We could've called for help.
3313039	eng	We thought you could help.
3313040	eng	We could use some help.
3313042	eng	We could use the help.
3313043	eng	We may need some help.
3313044	eng	We can use your help.
3313046	eng	We haven't made much headway.
3313049	eng	We all work too hard.
3313051	eng	We could use a hand.
3313053	eng	We were just saying goodbye.
3313054	eng	We should probably get going.
3313055	eng	We should really get going.
3313062	eng	We thought it was funny.
3313064	eng	We were just having fun.
3313066	eng	We got to be friends.
3313067	eng	We know you're Tom's friend.
3313068	eng	We could've made a fortune.
3313072	eng	We were just about finished.
3313075	eng	We got into a fight.
3313076	eng	We got in a fight.
3313081	eng	We need to try everything.
3313084	eng	We used to be engaged.
3313085	eng	We should be someplace else.
3313086	eng	We can take the elevator.
3313087	eng	We couldn't go out either.
3313088	eng	We can't do that either.
3313089	eng	We know what you're doing.
3313099	eng	We haven't had our dinner.
3313101	eng	We had a slight delay.
3313103	eng	We did have a deal.
3313106	eng	We had a rough day.
3313111	eng	We need to be creative.
3313113	eng	We sent Tom a copy.
3313114	eng	We should have a conversation.
3313115	eng	We shouldn't jump to conclusions.
3313128	eng	We'd still have a chance.
3313129	eng	We never got the chance.
3313130	eng	We still have a chance.
3313133	eng	We tried to be careful.
3313136	eng	We just got this car.
3313139	eng	We got an anonymous call.
3313140	eng	We made you a cake.
3313141	eng	We did very good business.
3313143	eng	We went out for breakfast.
3313145	eng	We never got to Boston.
3313146	eng	We were just in Boston.
3313147	eng	We could write a book.
3313151	eng	We should be getting back.
3313156	eng	We can come right away.
3313159	eng	We can't make any assumptions.
3313160	eng	We thought you were asleep.
3313161	eng	We did what you asked.
3313166	eng	We couldn't find it anywhere.
3313168	eng	We haven't agreed to anything.
3313173	eng	We should call an ambulance.
3313181	eng	Are we in trouble again?
3313620	eng	I'm swimming in the sea.
3313812	eng	My mother is a nurse.
3314129	eng	I'm pretty busy right now.
3314158	eng	I've been busy this week.
3314160	eng	I've been busy all week.
3314620	eng	Mondays aren't good for me.
3314624	eng	It's a very small town.
3314625	eng	It was a small wedding.
3314626	eng	Tom's room is quite small.
3314628	eng	You're lucky you're so small.
3314629	eng	It's smaller than I remember.
3314630	eng	Hand me that small screwdriver.
3314721	eng	Do I need a screwdriver?
3314730	eng	He never used a screwdriver.
3314731	eng	She never used a screwdriver.
3314969	eng	Tom gave a big yawn.
3314980	eng	Congratulations on your big victory.
3314986	eng	Tom caught a big trout.
3314987	eng	Tom landed a big trout.
3314997	eng	It's a big country, Tom.
3315003	eng	You owe me big time.
3315009	eng	It's not a big thing.
3315011	eng	It's much bigger than that.
3315012	eng	How big is the team?
3315015	eng	Well, that's a big surprise.
3315017	eng	It was a big surprise.
3315019	eng	Tom is big and strong.
3315023	eng	Tom is a big spender.
3315025	eng	That's a pretty big snake.
3315027	eng	Tom took a big sip.
3315029	eng	Tom is a big shot.
3315032	eng	How big was your school?
3315033	eng	How big is your school?
3315035	eng	Is there a big rush?
3315038	eng	It's still a big risk.
3315039	eng	Tom took a big risk.
3315046	eng	I'm getting a big raise.
3315048	eng	You've got a big problem.
3315058	eng	Tom wants a bigger office.
3315059	eng	It'll be a big occasion.
3315064	eng	You're in big trouble now.
3315066	eng	Tom has a big nose.
3315068	eng	It was a big night.
3315071	eng	So what's the big mystery?
3315074	eng	You've got a big mouth.
3315075	eng	Tom's got a big mouth.
3315078	eng	This is my big moment.
3315080	eng	It's all a big misunderstanding.
3315089	eng	We're making a big mistake.
3315090	eng	You've made a big mistake.
3315092	eng	That was my big mistake.
3315093	eng	That was a big mistake.
3315094	eng	It was a big mistake.
3315116	eng	Welcome to the big leagues.
3315120	eng	It's all a big joke.
3315121	eng	It's an awfully big job.
3315135	eng	Hey what's the big idea?
3315156	eng	That was a big help.
3315157	eng	This is a big help.
3315168	eng	You're taking a big gamble.
3315174	eng	Does Tom have big feet?
3315193	eng	How big was your donation?
3315194	eng	Tom has a big dog.
3315199	eng	This is a big decision.
3315217	eng	It's really a big deal.
3315218	eng	So what's the big deal?
3315219	eng	Yeah, it's no big deal.
3315220	eng	This isn't a big deal.
3315221	eng	It wasn't a big deal.
3315222	eng	It's a very big deal.
3315223	eng	This is no big deal.
3315224	eng	Is that a big deal?
3315225	eng	Is this a big deal?
3315226	eng	It was no big deal.
3315228	eng	This is a big deal.
3315236	eng	How big was your contribution?
3315238	eng	It's a pretty big club.
3315242	eng	This is your big chance.
3315258	eng	This is my big break.
3315284	eng	What's the big deal anyway?
3315286	eng	What was the big announcement?
3315518	eng	Can we make a substitution?
3315579	eng	Bookends are very useful things.
3315785	eng	She's going to the hospital.
3316036	eng	Am I pronouncing this correctly?
3316130	eng	My accent is probably strange.
3316479	eng	You're going the wrong direction.
3316579	eng	What a bunch of assclowns!
3316608	eng	Tom, I'm in the basement.
3316621	eng	The basement door was broken.

3317858	eng	The birch has white bark.
3317907	eng	Birch trees have white bark.
3318439	eng	And what is the problem?
3318448	eng	What music do you like?
3318763	eng	That is a false dichotomy.
3318843	eng	Come on, Tom. Let's go.
3318858	eng	It's part of the game.
3318888	eng	That was a little confusing.
3318907	eng	Tom is a graduate student.
3318908	eng	Mary is a graduate student.

3319230	eng	Tom's pulse is still strong.
3319242	eng	The paramedic checked Tom's pulse.
3319243	eng	The nurse checked Tom's pulse.
3319244	eng	Let me check your pulse.
3319245	eng	I couldn't find a pulse.
3319700	eng	The woman calls the man.
3319781	eng	Your car is repaired now.
3320106	eng	Sweat dripped from his body.
3320328	eng	Oh! Thank you, my dear.
3320674	eng	The guests are drinking Champagne.

3324537	eng	Tom won the thumb-wrestling competition.
3324570	eng	I may be overthinking this.

3324713	eng	That's a fairly reasonable price.
3325412	eng	Tom is a bit overweight.
3325416	eng	Tom says I'm not dependable.
3325419	eng	Tom is usually quite organized.

3330307	eng	I don't think I'm narrow-minded.
3330310	eng	I'll bear it in mind.
3330338	eng	I don't think I'm materialistic.
3330352	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom's lying.
3330355	eng	I miss Tom a lot.
3330364	eng	I owe Tom my life.
3330367	eng	I wasn't the team leader.
3330370	eng	I know that Tom knows.
3330383	eng	I'm only doing my job.
3330407	eng	I can't quite believe it.
3330408	eng	I'm happy Tom liked it.
3330409	eng	I'm glad to hear it.
3330430	eng	I've got to come in.

3330596	eng	I had a tough day.
3330602	eng	I brought Tom some cookies.
3330604	eng	I've never heard Tom complain.
3330606	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom's competent.
3330613	eng	I'm not here to celebrate.
3330616	eng	I should've been more careful.
3330620	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom's Canadian.
3330624	eng	I'm friends with Tom's brother.

3330680	eng	I'm sure Tom wouldn't approve.
3330681	eng	I'm sure Tom would approve.

3330689	eng	I'm pretty sure Tom's ambitious.
3330690	eng	I've said too much already.

3330899	eng	You know I love you.
3330900	eng	You can't go home yet.
3330916	eng	You have to help us.
3330925	eng	You crack me up, Tom.
3330927	eng	You may call me Tom.
3330937	eng	You sure took your time.
3330942	eng	You've got to do this.
3330948	eng	You might see Tom there.
3330950	eng	You should stop doing that.
3330961	eng	You two look the same.
3330983	eng	You come back soon, OK?
3330984	eng	You've got to go now.
3330985	eng	You can come in now.
3330986	eng	You can let go now.

3331026	eng	You know what it's like.
3331028	eng	You know why I left.
3331042	eng	You need to fix it.
3331047	eng	You made me do it.
3331054	eng	You've got to go home.

3331102	eng	You owe me a beer.
3331103	eng	You know where I'll be.
3331106	eng	You live too far away.
3331111	eng	You can't help Tom anymore.
3331414	eng	I went to the gym.
3331486	eng	Tom wants to become famous.
3332594	eng	I've just arrived from Paris.
3332599	eng	Pompey and his soldiers fled.
3332647	eng	Tom's an extremely honest person.
3332778	eng	Do turtles change their shells?

3333897	eng	Let me take you there.
3333900	eng	Did you guys hear that?
3333901	eng	Are you done with that?
3333909	eng	That's not a bad story.
3333915	eng	That's not a good sign.
3333916	eng	Have you ever been shot?
3333918	eng	Will you wait a second?
3333920	eng	Did we solve the problem?
3333922	eng	Did you call the police?
3333923	eng	Do you see my point?
3333925	eng	Do you own this place?
3333928	eng	Are you asking me out?
3333931	eng	Are you sure you're OK?

3333946	eng	This can't wait until morning.
3333947	eng	Do you have any more?
3333948	eng	Has Tom changed his mind?
3333949	eng	Will you still help me?
3333954	eng	Do you still need me?
3333955	eng	Do you still hate me?
3333966	eng	It can't take much longer.
3333967	eng	Have you been here long?
3333969	eng	Am I allowed to leave?
3333973	eng	Have you found a job?
3333975	eng	Have you seen my jacket?
3334005	eng	Are you coming back in?
3334009	eng	That's not a good idea.
3334014	eng	Are you sure it's here?
3334022	eng	Did you miss the game?
3334028	eng	So what do I do?
3334030	eng	Have you found a cure?
3334032	eng	Did you sign the contract?
3334034	eng	Do you think I care?
3334654	eng	You don't even like fish.
3335643	eng	Depending on others is taboo.
3335701	eng	You're still taller than me.
3335847	eng	No, we didn't bring anything.
3336516	eng	She is full of energy.
3336520	eng	You are full of energy.
3336593	eng	I really like telling jokes.
3337829	eng	Tom was having hot flashes.
3337959	eng	Why don't you email me?
3337971	eng	Have you finished the job?
3337992	eng	He put on his gloves.
3338497	eng	She left without saying goodbye.
3339100	eng	Tom supported the proposal wholeheartedly.
3339448	eng	My mom went collecting toe-biters.
3339494	eng	I pick weaver ant's nests.
3339973	eng	Let me shell the crab.
3339974	eng	Let me shuck the oysters.
3339980	eng	Let's unearth the sweet potatoes.
3339987	eng	She is a drooly girl.
3339989	eng	She is a snotty child.
3339991	eng	I've got an eye booger.
3339992	eng	I've got an ear booger.
3340146	eng	I'm able to speak French.
3340776	eng	Do you remember this movie?
3341099	eng	Don't trust what Tom says.
3341496	eng	I asked him a favor.
3341599	eng	My hair is very ugly.
3341621	eng	I've never regretted marrying you.
3341645	eng	The world is very complicated.
3341658	eng	Life can sometimes be difficult.
3341669	eng	I've got stuff to do.
3341670	eng	I've got lots to say.
3341673	eng	You'd better stop doing that.
3341676	eng	Don't you ever wonder why?
3341677	eng	Do you have an umbrella?
3341678	eng	Are you hard of hearing?
3341679	eng	Are you doing all right?

3341700	eng	You used to call me.
3341705	eng	You made it so easy.
3341708	eng	You have to stop it.
3341713	eng	You can count on me.
3341714	eng	You can count on it.
3341863	eng	This is a 30-passenger bus.
3342192	eng	She is a self-oriented person.
3342245	eng	I got Tom to help.
3342293	eng	Does Tom really need help?
3342481	eng	My friends are all married.
3342505	eng	He wants to marry me.
3342512	eng	We're going to try again.

3342792	eng	You owe me for that.
3342796	eng	You'll do as I say.
3342799	eng	You may have a point.
3342800	eng	You can use my phone.
3342804	eng	You two fight it out.
3342809	eng	You can come out now.
3342810	eng	You have to come now.
3342811	eng	You need to rest now.
3342816	eng	You know what I need.
3342817	eng	You'd be a great mother.
3342820	eng	You can live with me.
3342821	eng	You two come with me.
3342822	eng	You wanted to see me?
3342826	eng	You know Tom is lying.
3342827	eng	You said I was lying.
3342828	eng	You've taught me a lot.
3342829	eng	You taught me a lot.
3342830	eng	You know what I like.
3342834	eng	You have a great job.
3342836	eng	You got away with it.
3342839	eng	You've got to fix it.
3342840	eng	You've got to try it.
3342843	eng	You have to go inside.
3342844	eng	You can come back in.
3342846	eng	You can head on home.
3342849	eng	You can come in here.
3342852	eng	You need what I have.
3342854	eng	You can hold my hand.
3342858	eng	You should let it go.
3342859	eng	You've been a good friend.
3342861	eng	You said I was fat.
3342862	eng	You've got to go faster.
3342866	eng	You can take it easy.
3342869	eng	You need to lie down.
3342871	eng	You owe me three dollars.
3342872	eng	You just made my day.
3342878	eng	You can take a break.
3342881	eng	You've got to come back.
3342882	eng	You let Tom get away.
3342891	eng	I'm not a big spender.
3342939	eng	Stop calling me Miss Smarty-pants.
3343140	eng	Hopefully, this won't take long.
3343209	eng	Do you think I'm wrong?
3343210	eng	Are you sure it'll work?
3343212	eng	Are you still there, Tom?
3343213	eng	I live next to Tom.
3343216	eng	Do you think I'm right?
3343218	eng	Have you read this report?
3343224	eng	Tom grew up with me.
3343226	eng	Do you think I'm lying?
3343227	eng	Have you lived here long?
3343228	eng	Will you drop by later?
3343231	eng	Are you just getting in?
3343276	eng	Have you lost the receipt?
3343277	eng	Have you been working out?
3343279	eng	Are you taking your meds?
3343282	eng	Are you coming to dinner?
3343284	eng	Did you see the accident?
3343760	eng	Are you hiding something, Tom?
3344211	eng	Where is the money, Tom?
3344221	eng	Mind if I join you?
3344226	eng	I'll see you around, Tom.
3344546	eng	The rice crop was harvested.
3344548	eng	The watch battery was dead.
3344549	eng	The watch's battery ran out.
3344567	eng	It was bitterly cold outside.
3344982	eng	No one needs this sentence.
3345279	eng	You know me too well.
3345281	eng	You've got to see Tom.
3345282	eng	You may leave us, Tom.
3345286	eng	You may not have time.
3345287	eng	Are you looking for this?
3345288	eng	You have to take this.
3345291	eng	You can put it there.
3345295	eng	You can use my office.
3345296	eng	You can take over now.
3345299	eng	You're going to be late.
3345300	eng	You've got to be kidding.
3345304	eng	You're going to like it.
3345306	eng	You can't be in here.
3345308	eng	You asked me to help.
3345309	eng	Do you think that's funny?
3345310	eng	You look like a freak.
3345312	eng	You're going to do fine.
3345316	eng	Do you think that's bad?
3345317	eng	You have to come back.
3345789	eng	Was I asleep for long?
3346116	eng	Do you live on benefits?
3346188	eng	My cellphone's battery is dead.
3346241	eng	Are you sure this'll work?
3346242	eng	Are you cool with that?
3346358	eng	You've got work to do.
3346365	eng	You're too good to me.
3346371	eng	You've got a point there.
3346847	eng	I learned French in Paris.
3347085	eng	Tom stared at the ground.
3347121	eng	Are you calling me fat?
3347134	eng	You need to walk away.
3347135	eng	You need to move away.
3347136	eng	You let them get away.
3347139	eng	You and I are friends.
3347140	eng	You have a great gift.
3347143	eng	You know where I live.
3347144	eng	You know what I meant.
3347145	eng	You sound like my mom.
3347146	eng	You guys are too much.
3347147	eng	You look kind of pale.
3347148	eng	You still have a shot.
3347149	eng	You used to love that.
3347150	eng	You need to sign that.
3347151	eng	You can count on that.
3347152	eng	You have to stop them.
3347153	eng	You know what I think.
3347154	eng	You need to hear this.
3347155	eng	You have to stop this.
3347159	eng	You got what I want.
3347160	eng	You did your job well.
3347161	eng	You know where I work.
3347201	eng	Tom called me an idiot.
3347293	eng	Tom called me a fool.
3347306	eng	Tom cried tears of rage.
3347341	eng	You got here too early.
3347370	eng	You don't work for me.
3347372	eng	Do you think I'm kidding?
3347387	eng	Are you sure you're ready?
3347419	eng	You can't touch the paintings.
3347489	eng	I messed up big time.
3347490	eng	Tom messed up big time.
3347559	eng	Did I cook for nothing?
3347756	eng	Tom doesn't get enough sleep.
3348001	eng	He's too cute for words!
3348041	eng	You know Tom can't win.
3348042	eng	You've come a long way.
3348043	eng	You might find this useful.
3348044	eng	You may find this useful.
3348045	eng	You might find it useful.
3348046	eng	You may find it useful.
3348048	eng	You're a lot like Tom.
3348050	eng	You can't go anywhere today.
3348051	eng	You don't have much time.
3348055	eng	You have a great smile.
3348058	eng	You just need to relax.
3348060	eng	You seem kind of quiet.
3348061	eng	You may have a problem.
3348062	eng	You just need to practice.
3348064	eng	You look a little pale.
3348066	eng	You guys know too much.
3348067	eng	You look like a monkey.
3348071	eng	You look like an idiot.
3348072	eng	You need to try harder.
3348074	eng	You're going to have fun.
3348081	eng	You have to get closer.
3348082	eng	You left me no choice.
3348087	eng	You owe me an apology.
3348148	eng	Do I like interrogative inversions?
3348155	eng	The new furniture arrived today.
3348175	eng	Do you think they noticed?
3348176	eng	Do you think that'll work?
3348177	eng	Do you think it's possible?
3348178	eng	Do you still believe that?
3348211	eng	Are you a tax evader?
3348221	eng	You should've taken his advice.
3348224	eng	We don't say that anymore.
3348236	eng	My car isn't powerful enough.
3348251	eng	It's getting worse and worse.
3348274	eng	No one approved the proposal.
3348428	eng	You've got to move out.
3348812	eng	You've got paint on you.
3348813	eng	You've got to trust us.
3348817	eng	You've got to help them.
3348819	eng	You've got to believe that.
3348821	eng	You've got a car, right?
3348825	eng	You've done a good job.
3348827	eng	You've got to come home.
3348830	eng	You've done all you can.
3348832	eng	You've lost too much blood.
3348834	eng	You've got to do better.
3349175	eng	You're a mean old woman.
3349417	eng	Did you buy some flowers?
3349512	eng	You'll have to get help.
3349514	eng	You'll be taken care of.
3349515	eng	You'll be all right now.
3349517	eng	You'd better take it easy.
3349519	eng	You'd better come with me.
3349578	eng	We don't repair PCs here.
3349908	eng	A drink never hurt anybody.
3349916	eng	We'll work this out amicably.
3350045	eng	What did he do here?
3350049	eng	They made the right decision.
3350054	eng	Have you seen Tom's phone?
3350112	eng	Tom left work early today.
3350114	eng	This is all that's left.
3350116	eng	Please send me a postcard.
3350117	eng	Just leave it to me.
3350119	eng	I've never been to Tom's.
3350121	eng	I helped fix the leak.
3350124	eng	Have you made an appointment?
3350141	eng	Do you think that's enough?
3350148	eng	Do you have anything better?
3350150	eng	Did you see any footprints?
3350153	eng	Can you handle all this?
3350155	eng	Are you throwing me out?
3350157	eng	Are you sure nobody's hurt?
3350158	eng	Are you still seeing Tom?
3350169	eng	You pay me very well.
3350170	eng	It makes me feel alive.
3350172	eng	I'll be back at 2:30.
3351168	eng	Tom now uses Windows 8.1.
3351390	eng	The idea is not new.
3351641	eng	Mary is a video artist.
3352452	eng	What colour is the cloud?
3352668	eng	Her English was really good.
3352669	eng	His English is really good.
3353250	eng	He particularly insisted on this.
3353256	eng	You live inside my heart.
3354127	eng	You're sure taking your time.
3354128	eng	You're going to love this.
3354130	eng	You're going to need these.
3354140	eng	You're going to miss me.
3354141	eng	You're a mean old man.
3354142	eng	You're the woman I love.
3354143	eng	You're doing a good job.
3354144	eng	You're going to love it.
3354145	eng	You're going to make it.
3354146	eng	You're going to need it.
3354148	eng	You're not hard to find.
3354149	eng	You're not going to die.
3354151	eng	You're not working here anymore.
3354152	eng	You're better than I am.
3354454	eng	Guess who I saw today.
3354457	eng	Tom has a broken rib.
3354462	eng	I'm usually not this indecisive.
3354507	eng	You've left me no choice.
3354510	eng	You've got to protect me.
3354511	eng	You've got to fight back.
3354514	eng	You've done what you can.
3354515	eng	You've done a superb job.
3354637	eng	You're parked in my space.
3354641	eng	You've parked in my space.
3354909	eng	You're lying to me again.
3354911	eng	You're in over your head.
3354914	eng	You're going to do great.
3354915	eng	You're driving way too fast.
3354916	eng	You're doing all you can.
3354917	eng	You're doing a great job.
3354944	eng	You shouldn't lie to Tom.
3354945	eng	You shouldn't lie to me.
3354950	eng	You should've seen Tom dance.
3354953	eng	You should write a book.
3354954	eng	You should turn that off.
3354955	eng	You should run for mayor.
3354956	eng	You should run for governor.
3354959	eng	You should live a little.
3354960	eng	You should just stay here.
3354962	eng	You should go back there.
3354963	eng	You should get out more.
3354964	eng	You should fix your tie.
3354965	eng	You should come see this.
3354966	eng	You should check on Tom.
3354967	eng	You should check it out.
3354968	eng	You should be going soon.
3355040	eng	Do you think it's important?
3355047	eng	Tom's French is really good.
3355088	eng	What brought you to Korea?
3355235	eng	Mary used to be pretty.
3355238	eng	I have my hands full.
3355241	eng	Have you ever played poker?
3355242	eng	Have you changed your mind?
3355243	eng	Go back to your work.
3355244	eng	Did you finish your homework?
3355246	eng	Are you sure everything's OK?
3355254	eng	It was a reasonable law.
3355350	eng	You would've done the same.
3355351	eng	You'd have done the same.
3355352	eng	You'd better take a look.
3355354	eng	You'd better get over here.
3355355	eng	You'd better get out here.
3355357	eng	You'd better get here soon.
3355358	eng	You'd better get down here.
3355359	eng	You'd better get back here.
3355361	eng	You'd better call Tom up.
3355645	eng	That's not cool. That's hyper-cool!
3356061	eng	You're going to wait, right?
3356064	eng	You're quite fussy, aren't you?
3356065	eng	You're quite sharp, aren't you?
3356066	eng	You're really quiet, aren't you?
3356215	eng	Have you read the manual?
3356216	eng	Did you read the instructions?
3356260	eng	You don't look like Tom.
3356273	eng	You know I respect you.
3356284	eng	You weren't kidding, were you?
3356285	eng	You guys can't leave yet.
3356286	eng	You don't have to yell.
3356289	eng	You look a little winded.
3356291	eng	You'd better rest a while.
3356292	eng	You'd better lead the way.
3356294	eng	You'll just have to wait.
3356295	eng	You were right as usual.
3356296	eng	You'd better check it twice.
3356297	eng	You know it's not true.
3356298	eng	You know that's not true.
3356303	eng	You look a little tired.
3356305	eng	You said that last time.
3356307	eng	You'd better look at this.
3356309	eng	You did a good thing.
3356312	eng	You sound just like them.
3356317	eng	You'll be seeing Tom soon.
3356318	eng	You don't have to shout.
3356319	eng	You take things too seriously.
3356320	eng	You'll do whatever I say.
3356321	eng	You look exactly the same.
3356323	eng	You may have been right.
3356324	eng	You might just be right.
3356326	eng	You used to teach, right?
3356327	eng	You'll wait for me, right?
3356333	eng	You did that on purpose.
3356339	eng	You need to come outside.
3356342	eng	You should throw these out.
3356343	eng	You should throw this out.
3356344	eng	You'd better check this out.
3356345	eng	You'll have to leave now.
3356349	eng	You remind me of myself.
3356350	eng	You sound like my mother.
3356352	eng	You spend too much money.
3356353	eng	You're right on the money.
3356354	eng	You may change your mind.
3356355	eng	You know I hate meetings.
3356356	eng	You don't even know me.
3356359	eng	You guys can't scare me.
3356360	eng	You look beautiful to me.
3356361	eng	You look familiar to me.
3356364	eng	You never even noticed me.
3356365	eng	You said you'd help me.
3356367	eng	You'll be fine without me.
3356373	eng	You might as well leave.
3356382	eng	You just can't ignore it.
3356383	eng	You know it's worth it.
3356386	eng	You may not like it.
3356389	eng	You ought to try it.
3356390	eng	You really should read it.
3356391	eng	You'll have to handle it.
3356393	eng	You sound like an idiot.
3356394	eng	You said it didn't hurt.
3356398	eng	You know why we're here.
3356401	eng	You'll have to come here.
3356408	eng	You guys are doing great.
3356409	eng	You know it's not good.
3356410	eng	You're just not very good.
3356412	eng	You have a pretty garden.
3356413	eng	You know it'll be fine.
3356414	eng	You were doing just fine.
3356415	eng	You drive way too fast.
3356417	eng	You know this isn't fair.
3356418	eng	You have such pretty eyes.
3356424	eng	You need to settle down.
3356425	eng	You know what I'm doing.
3356428	eng	You got what you deserve.
3356429	eng	You scared me to death.
3356432	eng	You may have a concussion.
3356434	eng	You never stood a chance.
3356435	eng	You really took a chance.
3356438	eng	You made the right call.
3356444	eng	You said I'd get better.
3356445	eng	You said I was beautiful.
3356446	eng	You drive a hard bargain.
3356447	eng	You hurt Tom pretty bad.
3356449	eng	You said to call anytime.
3356450	eng	You were right all along.
3357800	eng	You'll be hearing from us.
3357801	eng	You're going to need this.
3357802	eng	You're not going in there.
3357803	eng	You're too smart for that.
3357809	eng	You've got a great memory.
3357810	eng	You'll be hearing from me.
3357812	eng	You've got to be joking.
3357815	eng	You're going to need help.
3357816	eng	You're acting like a fool.
3357818	eng	You've got to calm down.
3357819	eng	You'll never see me again.
3357981	eng	This chocolate tastes really good.
3358136	eng	She is not there yet.
3358338	eng	You think you're so smart.
3358339	eng	You think you're so funny.
3358341	eng	You remind me of somebody.
3358343	eng	You never did that before.
3358355	eng	You did an incredible job.
3358356	eng	You did a fantastic job.
3358409	eng	You could've come with me.
3358413	eng	You could well be right.
3358414	eng	You could use some rest.
3358585	eng	You can read, can't you?
3358588	eng	You can't just leave us.
3358589	eng	You agreed to take turns.
3358591	eng	You can always text Tom.
3358597	eng	You all passed the test.
3358598	eng	You came on too strong.
3358599	eng	You can't throw me out.
3358601	eng	You can't turn back now.
3358607	eng	You can catch me later.
3358608	eng	You can thank me later.
3358609	eng	You can't just ignore it.
3358611	eng	You caught me off guard.
3358721	eng	You haven't changed a bit.
3358759	eng	You'd better come out here.
3358766	eng	You're not even thirty yet.
3358771	eng	You should leave right now.
3358785	eng	You're pretty good at this.
3358795	eng	You're taking quite a risk.
3358802	eng	You're standing on my foot.
3358880	eng	You're going to hurt yourself.
3358882	eng	You can manage, can't you?
3358893	eng	You haven't even tried yet.
3358895	eng	You weren't here last year.
3358896	eng	You couldn't be more wrong.
3358900	eng	You made a wrong turn.
3358902	eng	You look very nice tonight.
3358903	eng	You sure are quiet tonight.
3358904	eng	You sure seem happy tonight.
3358909	eng	You haven't got much time.
3358910	eng	You're running out of time.
3358917	eng	You're pretty good at that.
3358921	eng	You should try it sometime.
3358923	eng	You guys can't be serious.
3358925	eng	I would never betray you.
3358926	eng	You'd better get some rest.
3358931	eng	You should call more often.
3358932	eng	You should visit more often.
3358934	eng	You can't go right now.
3358937	eng	You shouldn't be here now.
3358939	eng	You were missed last night.
3358940	eng	You did what was necessary.
3358941	eng	You guys better get moving.
3358944	eng	You still owe me money.
3358945	eng	You still owe us money.
3358948	eng	You're starting to bore me.
3358955	eng	You're just doing your job.
3358958	eng	You'd better get back inside.
3358960	eng	You'd better take Tom home.
3358962	eng	You have really great hair.
3358964	eng	You're going to be exhausted.
3358968	eng	You've got yourself a deal.
3358969	eng	You think you're so clever.
3358972	eng	You're going to love Boston.
3358973	eng	You're looking a bit bored.
3358976	eng	You can't leave Tom behind.
3358977	eng	You three are under arrest.
3359693	eng	Would you mind explaining this?
3359701	eng	We've got too many rules.
3359712	eng	Do you think that's necessary?
3359721	eng	Are you almost done here?
3359722	eng	This game is really fun.
3359733	eng	Are you backing out already?
3359870	eng	My nose is too big.
3359899	eng	She lives like a princess.
3359920	eng	You've been practicing, haven't you?
3359941	eng	Take the kids to school.
3359962	eng	I thought you looked familiar.
3360139	eng	All of us like Tom.
3360144	eng	I wonder why birds migrate.
3360151	eng	I wish she'd stop smoking.
3360174	eng	You're really patient, aren't you?
3360181	eng	You should've seen what happened.
3360198	eng	You've got three months left.
3360200	eng	You've been a great audience.
3360201	eng	You're not going fast enough.
3360202	eng	You're just like your sister.
3360207	eng	You'd better come right away.
3360210	eng	You should get married again.
3360213	eng	You really do look beautiful.
3360223	eng	You did everything you could.
3360224	eng	You could've all been killed.
3360226	eng	You've made me look foolish.
3360230	eng	You've done so much already.
3360234	eng	You've been a good audience.
3360235	eng	You're welcome to wait here.
3360237	eng	You're putting me on, right?
3360238	eng	You're not saying very much.
3360240	eng	You're not doing this right.
3360241	eng	You're just like the others.
3360247	eng	You'll do as you're ordered.
3360248	eng	You shouldn't listen to Tom.
3360250	eng	You should've seen the fire.
3360253	eng	You should get that checked.
3360254	eng	You should get some shuteye.
3360258	eng	You should come by sometime.
3360259	eng	You should call your lawyer.
3360262	eng	You really do look stunning.
3360266	eng	You need a heart transplant.
3360267	eng	You might as well surrender.
3360268	eng	You made a horrible mistake.
3360269	eng	You leave me no alternative.
3360276	eng	You haven't lost your touch.
3360277	eng	You haven't lifted a finger.
3360278	eng	You haven't learned a thing.
3360304	eng	You'd better call a lawyer.
3360305	eng	You shouldn't even be here.
3360306	eng	You shouldn't be back here.
3360308	eng	You'll help me, won't you?
3360312	eng	You really do look great.
3360315	eng	You can't just walk away.
3360317	eng	You've done a great job.
3360322	eng	You didn't have to come.
3360323	eng	You did good work today.
3360325	eng	I'll never ever forget Tom.
3360328	eng	You must be very rich.
3360330	eng	You can count on Tom.
3360343	eng	That's none of our business.
3360380	eng	You can do it, Tom.
3360484	eng	You're difficult to work with.
3360493	eng	You haven't worked in months.
3360495	eng	You're doing good work here.
3360496	eng	You're doing wonderful work here.
3360498	eng	You've been working too hard.
3360500	eng	You're not working hard enough.
3360505	eng	You've done a remarkable job.
3360506	eng	You will be held accountable.
3360544	eng	This seems good to me.
3360547	eng	I can't find my umbrella.
3360569	eng	Tom lost all his money.
3360589	eng	Tom and Mary played chess.
3360595	eng	How old were you then?
3360609	eng	Tom is mad at you.
3360624	eng	Tom has no hat on.
3360950	eng	Tom got muddy playing football.
3361123	eng	You're going to like this.
3361145	eng	Could you drop me off?
3361166	eng	Why her and not me?
3361167	eng	Why him and not me?
3361185	eng	Everybody was staring at Tom.
3361190	eng	You're seeing someone, aren't you?
3361237	eng	Good luck. You'll need it.
3361380	eng	Have you got another plan?
3361402	eng	Suddenly, the crowd fell silent.
3361500	eng	You always pick his side!
3361501	eng	You always pick her side.
3361739	eng	I would never insult you.
3361771	eng	Does this thing embarrass you?
3361776	eng	Diseases begin to come forward.
3361830	eng	Shoot yourself with a shotgun.
3361839	eng	He disposes of them instantly.
3361854	eng	Your liver would like it.
3361895	eng	I do not feel free!
3361917	eng	Why don't you implement it?
3361950	eng	Is the drawing quite explanatory?
3361970	eng	At least you had fun.
3361981	eng	I like how you reason.
3362166	eng	Norway is my new homeland.
3362173	eng	Maybe it wasn't so obvious.
3362174	eng	Give food to the homeless.
3362431	eng	It's the height of luxury.
3362432	eng	It's the pinnacle of luxury.
3362900	eng	Do you have another plan?
3363717	eng	There's no cure for that.
3363724	eng	Mary is a pretty girl.
3363734	eng	I caught three fish today.
3363737	eng	All the doors are locked.
3364203	eng	I'm worried about the future.
3364254	eng	I'm thrilled with my purchase.
3364404	eng	Thank you for your efforts.
3364490	eng	That guy is batshit crazy.
3364598	eng	When is Tom due back?
3364599	eng	When does Tom get back?
3364604	eng	What else does Tom do?
3364606	eng	Who did Tom vote for?
3364607	eng	What room is Tom in?
3364608	eng	Why can't Tom do it?
3364609	eng	Where did Tom buy it?
3364611	eng	Will I see Tom later?
3364612	eng	Why did Tom kiss me?
3364613	eng	How will Tom stop me?
3364616	eng	Does Tom have a pet?
3364617	eng	Does Tom have any pets?
3364619	eng	What if Tom is right?
3364621	eng	How does Tom do this?
3364622	eng	Why did you fire Tom?
3364630	eng	Did I wake Tom up?
3364632	eng	What if Tom is wrong?
3364633	eng	What did Tom get you?
3365377	eng	What should we do now?
3365638	eng	I have to be here.
3365641	eng	Have you been there before?
3365644	eng	Do you have anything else?
3365774	eng	They are no longer recognizable.
3365844	eng	Look at that red car.
3366425	eng	I'll roast him some meat.
3366432	eng	I'll make some peanut butter.
3366447	eng	You can't go to town.
3366452	eng	They'll build you a house.
3367256	eng	Did you really say that?
3367270	eng	You're not welcome here anymore.
3367275	eng	I also need a pillow.
3367282	eng	Can I get another blanket?
3367316	eng	My hair is naturally curly.
3367350	eng	Were you mean to her?
3367401	eng	I didn't get his autograph.
3367402	eng	I didn't get her autograph.
3367751	eng	I saw Joe last Sunday.
3367754	eng	Why are you doing this?
3368058	eng	Did you really do that?
3368194	eng	Did Tom get my message?
3368196	eng	Did Tom take Mary home?
3368197	eng	Does Tom go to church?
3368198	eng	Does Tom know my name?
3368199	eng	Does Tom like it there?
3368201	eng	How can I reach Tom?
3368202	eng	How much does Tom weigh?
3368204	eng	What did Tom get me?
3368206	eng	What more does Tom need?
3368207	eng	What page is Tom on?
3368208	eng	What took Tom so long?
3368210	eng	Why did Tom leave you?
3368212	eng	Why did you attack Tom?
3368214	eng	Why did you shoot Tom?
3368216	eng	Why is Tom still here?
3368217	eng	Your name is Tom, right?
3368234	eng	This casino is losing money.
3368506	eng	You're in the good spot.
3368560	eng	Tom arrived precisely on time.
3368689	eng	Tom knows what deserves attention.
3368708	eng	It will be dreadfully hot.
3368714	eng	They considered that topic important.
3368737	eng	You look good in black.
3368809	eng	It's very humid, isn't it?
3368837	eng	Tom is an old footballer.
3368850	eng	What Tom did was wrong.
3368851	eng	Please take Tom with you.
3368853	eng	It's hard to surprise Tom.
3368856	eng	I'm sure Tom misses you.
3368865	eng	Thanks for the good conversation.
3369516	eng	She has a good memory.
3369529	eng	She has a good reputation.
3369967	eng	What should I have done?
3370277	eng	I'll sleep on the floor.
3370325	eng	The ink is still wet.
3370326	eng	The blood was still wet.
3370677	eng	Who else knows about this?
3370685	eng	I'm aware of the danger.
3370766	eng	My hair is still damp.
3370777	eng	Mary isn't all that cute.
3370780	eng	Mary is my older sister.
3371105	eng	I'll see you in hell.
3371178	eng	Do you need me, Tom?
3371179	eng	Get used to it, Tom.
3371183	eng	Glad to see you, Tom.
3371184	eng	Have a nice day, Tom.
3371185	eng	I love you, too, Tom.
3371187	eng	Nice to see you, Tom.
3371188	eng	Try to be brave, Tom.
3371191	eng	Where can we find Tom?
3371192	eng	See you next week, Tom.
3371195	eng	I think Tom is intrigued.
3371197	eng	We're almost home now, Tom.
3371199	eng	I thought Tom was annoying.
3371204	eng	You're confusing me with Tom.
3371365	eng	Koala bears smell like eucalyptus.
3371530	eng	I like the movie "Me".
3371857	eng	My patience has run out.
3371935	eng	She doesn't wash the dishes.
3371952	eng	Tom plays in a band.
3371972	eng	They were talking about me.
3371974	eng	None of that was true.
3372035	eng	I can read your thoughts.
3372037	eng	I guess we're even now.
3372050	eng	I thought you didn't drink.
3372069	eng	He tried to manipulate me.
3372071	eng	It was kind of weird.
3372077	eng	What will my parents think?
3372117	eng	He's charming, funny and intelligent.
3372140	eng	Why are you always here?
3372236	eng	Don't lie about your age.
3372390	eng	You're making too much noise.
3372392	eng	You're on the wrong road.
3372395	eng	You're running short of time.
3372398	eng	You barely touched your food.
3372400	eng	You didn't eat very much.
3372615	eng	You weren't even there yesterday.
3372651	eng	You know that's not possible.
3372929	eng	You had me completely fooled.
3372933	eng	You haven't convinced me yet.
3372940	eng	You shouldn't have called me.
3372941	eng	You should've called the cops.
3373017	eng	You'll land on your feet.
3373025	eng	You've known me thirty years.
3373028	eng	You're lying now, aren't you?
3373029	eng	You're looking a little pale.
3373048	eng	You couldn't wait, could you?
3373049	eng	You couldn't have known that.
3373056	eng	Please don't throw anything out.
3373158	eng	I'm fine, thanks for asking!
3373839	eng	The whole world loves Brazil.
3374141	eng	I can do it, too.
3374147	eng	How do I do that?
3374209	eng	Tell me what really happened.
3374210	eng	We are all relatively tired.
3374237	eng	Tom is a software developer.
3374653	eng	That's why I love you.
3374654	eng	I'll bring it to you.
3374662	eng	I need to know why.
3374663	eng	I get what I want.
3374665	eng	How does that help us?
3374667	eng	I got you a treat.
3374669	eng	I'm going to stop Tom.
3374674	eng	Why would I do this?
3374675	eng	I need time to think.
3374676	eng	Is that a bad thing?
3374679	eng	We need to stop them.
3374680	eng	Why do you need them?
3374682	eng	I want more than that.
3374683	eng	I'm trying to do that.
3374685	eng	I can help with that.
3374686	eng	We took care of that.
3374698	eng	You have a nice smile.
3374708	eng	I feel like I'm ready.
3374712	eng	It's a very good plan.
3374721	eng	Three is all we need.
3374727	eng	What did you bring me?
3374737	eng	What did it look like?
3374738	eng	I may need a lawyer.
3374739	eng	I might be home late.
3374742	eng	I've got the car keys.
3374745	eng	Put your back into it.
3374746	eng	We're going to fix it.
3374747	eng	Did you ever find it?
3374752	eng	We have to try it.
3374754	eng	I have my own house.
3374763	eng	Then where did you go?
3374778	eng	Then what did you do?
3374779	eng	What else could I do?
3374784	eng	Why do you even care?
3374786	eng	Why are you in bed?
3374788	eng	How do I get back?
3374789	eng	I need to get away.
3374978	eng	I was in excellent spirits.
3375352	eng	He's as stupid as stubborn.
3375746	eng	You owe it to yourself.
3375749	eng	It might not even work.
3375750	eng	I'll see you next week.
3375751	eng	Leave the matter to us.
3375752	eng	Who's going to stop us?
3375753	eng	I got a parking ticket.
3375757	eng	How do you figure that?
3375758	eng	Why would they do that?
3375759	eng	I know it sounds silly.
3375764	eng	My door is always open.
3375767	eng	That was a great movie.
3375769	eng	What did they bring me?
3375770	eng	You look like a lawyer.
3375774	eng	I no longer need it.
3375782	eng	Do the best you can.
3376500	eng	Does Tom believe in God?
3377073	eng	I'm glad Tom invited you.
3377075	eng	We'd do anything for you.
3377079	eng	It's about to get worse.
3377080	eng	This is really going well.
3377081	eng	You're not doing so well.
3377084	eng	I've found a better way.
3377085	eng	What color is your truck?
3377086	eng	We'll deal with it tomorrow.
3377093	eng	It looked similar to this.
3377094	eng	When did you decide this?
3377099	eng	Who would ever believe that?
3377104	eng	I'm real sorry about that.
3377105	eng	There's a reason for that.
3377107	eng	What's so wrong with that?
3377108	eng	How will you manage that?
3377111	eng	How long will that take?
3377112	eng	You have our full support.
3377113	eng	You'd better do it soon.
3377114	eng	What color were Tom's socks?
3377115	eng	I bought the wrong size.
3377116	eng	How long was your shift?
3377117	eng	What exactly did you see?
3377118	eng	I like my eggs scrambled.
3377122	eng	I thought you were rude.
3377124	eng	You'd better do it quickly.
3377127	eng	What have you found out?
3377132	eng	I was working all night.
3377133	eng	I looked into the mirror.
3377137	eng	Leave the driving to me.
3377138	eng	Thank you for asking me.
3377140	eng	That's the choice we made.
3377141	eng	I'm a very good listener.
3377142	eng	How long will that last?
3377143	eng	That's about all I know.
3377146	eng	Please be quick about it.
3377155	eng	I thought Tom could help.
3377157	eng	Where are you folks from?
3377159	eng	It's not all your fault.
3377160	eng	You'd better do it fast.
3377161	eng	There was a huge explosion.
3377164	eng	Would you call a doctor?
3377166	eng	It was the right decision.
3377167	eng	That was a bad decision.
3377169	eng	It's not open to debate.
3377170	eng	It gets worse every day.
3377171	eng	What crime did you commit?
3377173	eng	I'm not going to change.
3377174	eng	You never had a chance.
3377175	eng	What color is your car?
3377176	eng	Are you a natural blonde?
3377177	eng	It's only just the beginning.
3377180	eng	We hardly see you anymore.
3377181	eng	I'd like an honest answer.
3377182	eng	We can start over again.
3377450	eng	Tom takes after his mother.
3377896	eng	How much is this book?
3377898	eng	This book costs 20 dollars.
3377906	eng	This is my Japanese friend.
3377910	eng	This is a Chinese restaurant.
3377928	eng	Who taught you to speak?
3377991	eng	Yesterday I sold two books.
3378002	eng	I think this is blue.
3378010	eng	I buy you a present.
3378014	eng	I know the Chinese characters.
3378018	eng	Both my parents are musicians.
3378020	eng	My sister is a teacher.
3378022	eng	My major is comparative religion.

3396447	eng	Send the bill to me.
3396449	eng	Do you trust my judgment?
3396452	eng	This is our only hope.
3396456	eng	This ought to be fun.
3396460	eng	Should I ask someone else?
3396461	eng	That was a foolish decision.
3396462	eng	Are you a good dancer?
3396465	eng	That would be very beneficial.
3396500	eng	Who should I believe now?
3396540	eng	Those haven't been cleaned yet.
3396543	eng	It looks like you're wrong.
3396547	eng	Do you think that's wise?
3396552	eng	That's what I can't understand.
3396554	eng	Do you think that's true?
3396571	eng	We should get together sometime.
3396574	eng	That's an interesting-looking salt shaker.
3396575	eng	That didn't really make sense.
3396581	eng	I sure hope you're right.
3396599	eng	You'll have to excuse me.
3396603	eng	Is that what you'd like?
3396607	eng	We've been asked to leave.
3396614	eng	That's good news, isn't it?
3396626	eng	We shouldn't even be here.
3396628	eng	We've been asked to help.
3396630	eng	Show me what you've got.
3396631	eng	Show us what you've got.
3396641	eng	Do you think that's fair?
3396645	eng	I believe we've seen enough.
3396649	eng	Look at what you've done.
3396652	eng	Show me what you've done.
3396657	eng	What is it you're doing?
3396665	eng	This is kind of cool.
3396669	eng	That was just a coincidence.
3396673	eng	Actually, I'm kind of busy.
3396686	eng	Aren't you guys done yet?
3396688	eng	Did you guys make up?
3396689	eng	Would you guys shut up?
3396691	eng	Did you guys see that?
3396696	eng	Are you guys dating now?
3396697	eng	How did you guys meet?
3396698	eng	Could you guys help me?
3396700	eng	Why did you guys leave?
3396704	eng	Where are you guys headed?
3396709	eng	How are you guys doing?
3396710	eng	What did you guys do?
3396711	eng	What do you guys do?
3396716	eng	Do you guys see anything?
3396730	eng	Who else could've done it?
3396731	eng	Where were you guys today?
3396738	eng	I hope it works out.
3396740	eng	Promise me you'll do that.
3396745	eng	Why didn't you ask me?
3396749	eng	Are you saying that's true?
3396750	eng	Are you guys still dating?
3396752	eng	What are you guys planning?
3396755	eng	It really wasn't that hard.
3396756	eng	It's really true, isn't it?
3396763	eng	Are you sure that's enough?
3396765	eng	It's good that you're here.
3396770	eng	That's what you're good at.
3396777	eng	Look at what you've become.
3396779	eng	It's rather good, isn't it?
3396784	eng	Tom is kind of standoffish.
3396788	eng	Are you really only thirteen?
3396793	eng	Are you guys still together?
3396801	eng	That's a possibility, isn't it?
3396814	eng	That's what I would've done.
3396832	eng	The concert hasn't started yet.
3396833	eng	We haven't found it yet.
3396837	eng	These people can't be trusted.
3396838	eng	Why are you helping Tom?
3396842	eng	Why do you need these?
3396846	eng	Do you think that's possible?
3396847	eng	What's that you're working on?
3396852	eng	This place hasn't changed much.
3396854	eng	I haven't changed my mind.
3396855	eng	Why didn't you get married?
3396856	eng	What're you guys doing later?
3396858	eng	Have you looked outside lately?
3396879	eng	That was totally uncalled for.
3396880	eng	What're you guys looking for?
3396881	eng	That's what I should've done.
3396884	eng	Keep doing what you're doing.
3396885	eng	What've you guys been doing?
3396891	eng	My whole family's from Boston.
3396897	eng	Have you fixed the thermostat?
3396903	eng	That's the only logical choice.
3396904	eng	They both look very uncomfortable.
3396918	eng	I haven't got it yet.
3399330	eng	It was over in minutes.
3399351	eng	May the Gods help us.
3399353	eng	Will we be safe here?
3399370	eng	He always twists my words.
3399379	eng	Is there something troubling you?
3399477	eng	They're not roommates. They're lovers.
3399595	eng	I feel energetic and happy.
3399605	eng	I felt guilty and sad.
3399616	eng	Why are you taking pictures?
3399631	eng	Do you remember anything else?
3399635	eng	I like that one better.
3399645	eng	He just doesn't get it.
3401488	eng	Tom is a ruthless businessman.
3401894	eng	I forgot to tell him.
3401898	eng	I forgot to tell her.
3401899	eng	I forgot to tell them.
3401930	eng	Oranges are a seasonal fruit.
3401940	eng	Does this thing actually work?
3402217	eng	Tom will return at 2:30.
3402222	eng	Tom went home at 2:30.
3402231	eng	Tom left home at 2:30.
3402238	eng	Tom didn't return till 2:30.
3402239	eng	Tom didn't come until 2:30.
3402240	eng	Pick me up at 2:30.
3402253	eng	You should ask Tom yourself.
3402259	eng	Tom wants to look younger.
3402260	eng	Tom makes me feel young.
3402267	eng	Tom is still very young.
3402271	eng	Tom warned me about you.
3402280	eng	You're not angry, are you?
3402293	eng	You're a freshman, aren't you?
3402297	eng	Tom isn't mad at you.
3402302	eng	Why did Tom call you?
3402303	eng	We tried to call you.
3402304	eng	What do they call you?
3402312	eng	You got hurt, didn't you?
3402340	eng	When can I expect you?
3402341	eng	How did Tom find you?
3402342	eng	Why would I fire you?
3402343	eng	Did Tom work for you?
3402345	eng	Tom will wait for you.
3402351	eng	Tom was looking for you.
3402357	eng	Spinach is good for you.
3402364	eng	Look what I got you.
3402366	eng	You've done time, haven't you?
3402383	eng	Did Tom ever hurt you?
3402387	eng	Tom is just kidding you.
3402390	eng	When did Tom leave you?
3402392	eng	I really do like you.
3402394	eng	Where can we meet you?
3402396	eng	I think Tom misses you.
3402399	eng	That was sweet of you.
3402401	eng	That's awful sweet of you.
3402403	eng	Tom reminds me of you.
3402404	eng	That's very generous of you.
3402405	eng	Who took care of you?
3402407	eng	What do we owe you?
3402408	eng	What does Tom owe you?
3402420	eng	Come on, I'll show you.
3402422	eng	Where can I take you?
3402426	eng	Tom is stronger than you.
3402428	eng	Am I older than you?
3402429	eng	They're all older than you.
3402431	eng	How can I thank you?
3402437	eng	Tom was lying to you.
3402438	eng	Would Tom lie to you?
3402447	eng	Why did I trust you?
3402448	eng	How can I trust you?
3402449	eng	They seem to trust you.
3402452	eng	Tom tried to warn you.
3402455	eng	You were worried, weren't you?
3402457	eng	You were married, weren't you?
3402458	eng	You were curious, weren't you?
3402464	eng	Can I ride with you?
3402468	eng	Tom is angry with you.
3402486	eng	Tom hasn't come here yet.
3402488	eng	Tom hasn't made it yet.
3402492	eng	Tom isn't a lawyer yet.
3402505	eng	Tom isn't quite sure yet.
3402509	eng	Do you trust Tom yet?
3402510	eng	Has anyone found Tom yet?
3402512	eng	Tom hasn't seen us yet.
3402515	eng	You made that clear yesterday.
3402523	eng	Tom didn't go there yesterday.
3402538	eng	Tom was arrested last year.
3402544	eng	That's not what I wrote.
3402546	eng	Tom may not be wrong.
3402548	eng	Tom may have been wrong.
3402552	eng	I think Tom is wrong.
3402560	eng	Tom knew it was wrong.
3402566	eng	Tom has been seriously wounded.
3402567	eng	It's just a flesh wound.
3402571	eng	Tom prepared for the worst.
3402580	eng	That's the way it works.
3402581	eng	That's not how it works.
3402586	eng	Tom is a construction worker.
3402590	eng	Tom whistled as he worked.
3402593	eng	Tom's plan never would've worked.
3402594	eng	Tom is still at work.
3402600	eng	Tom focused on his work.
3402602	eng	Tom is doing his work.
3402605	eng	That computer might not work.
3402634	eng	Time is of the essence.
3403132	eng	Tom scarcely said a word.
3403134	eng	Tom looks like a woman.
3403137	eng	Just get it over with.
3403144	eng	Tom is clearly the winner.
3403145	eng	Tom drank too much wine.

3403151	eng	Tom rolled up the window.
3403152	eng	Tom climbed through the window.
3403153	eng	Tom crawled through the window.
3403156	eng	Tom stood near the window.
3403160	eng	Tom knew he couldn't win.
3403161	eng	Tom is sure to win.
3403164	eng	Go home to your wife.
3403165	eng	Tom opened his mouth wide.
3403171	eng	The difficult question is why.
3403173	eng	The unspoken question is why.
3403174	eng	The question now is why.
3403178	eng	The only question is who.
3403180	eng	The question now is who.
3403181	eng	Tom painted the fence white.
3403183	eng	It could take a while.
3403184	eng	It might take a while.
3403188	eng	Tom hesitated for a while.
3403192	eng	The difficult question is where.
3403193	eng	The only question is where.
3403195	eng	The question now is where.
3403196	eng	The only question is when.
3403198	eng	The question now is when.
3403199	eng	It's a question of when.
3403201	eng	Tom is in a wheelchair.
3403210	eng	Tom started crying as well.
3403216	eng	Tom was doing pretty well.
3403219	eng	Tom isn't doing so well.
3403223	eng	Tom can sing very well.
3403227	eng	Tom doesn't cook very well.
3403230	eng	Tom made us feel welcome.
3403233	eng	Tom has been gaining weight.
3403250	eng	We just met last week.
3403261	eng	It could be a weapon.
3403262	eng	Tom seems to be wealthy.
3403263	eng	Tom used to be wealthy.
3403270	eng	Do I appear that weak?
3403271	eng	There may be another way.
3403280	eng	Tom felt the same way.
3403281	eng	Tom took off that way.
3403284	eng	Tom must've gone that way.
3403286	eng	Tom showed me the way.
3403288	eng	Tom never looked this way.
3403289	eng	Tom must've gone this way.
3403291	eng	There may be a way.
3403292	eng	Tom doesn't really like watermelon.
3403296	eng	Tom plunged into the water.
3403316	eng	The water's not very warm.
3403327	eng	Who cares what Tom wants?
3403328	eng	It's nice to feel wanted.
3403329	eng	Tom found what he wanted.
3403331	eng	What do you men want?
3403332	eng	What did Tom really want?
3403333	eng	What does Tom really want?
3403348	eng	Is that all you want?
3403353	eng	Tom is a fast walker.
3403360	eng	Tom is taking a walk.
3403363	eng	How long can you wait?
3403365	eng	Tom has a beautiful voice.
3403366	eng	Tom has a good voice.
3403373	eng	Let me get my violin.
3403376	eng	Does Tom ever get violent?
3403378	eng	Tom felt his phone vibrate.
3403381	eng	Am I being too vague?
3403382	eng	Tom is now on vacation.
3403383	eng	Tom is away on vacation.
3403386	eng	Did Tom ask about us?
3403387	eng	Tom isn't mad at us.
3403396	eng	Keep Tom away from us.
3403403	eng	They tried to kill us.
3403404	eng	Why did you leave us?
3403410	eng	Tom may not remember us.
3403411	eng	How can you stop us?
3403412	eng	How would you stop us?
3403415	eng	Who sent this to us?
3403419	eng	Tom waved goodbye to us.
3403430	eng	Tom is coming with us.
3403435	eng	Tom shouldn't be with us.
3403436	eng	Tom won't agree with us.
3403438	eng	Why would I be upset?
3403441	eng	Tom started to back up.
3403445	eng	The sun just came up.
3403448	eng	Tom must've made it up.
3403450	eng	The rain has let up.
3403451	eng	My mind is made up.
3403452	eng	Tom's mind is made up.
3403454	eng	Tom didn't wake me up.
3403457	eng	Please clean this place up.
3403458	eng	Tom was pretty shaken up.
3403460	eng	Tom seemed pretty shook up.
3403461	eng	Tom tried to stand up.
3403465	eng	When did Tom wake up?
3403466	eng	Where can I wash up?

3405165	eng	Tom isn't the marrying type.
3405176	eng	Tom made a wrong turn.
3405181	eng	It's certainly worth a try.
3405184	eng	Tom must've known the truth.
3405185	eng	Tom must know the truth.
3405186	eng	Can Tom handle the truth?
3405189	eng	Tom isn't to be trusted.
3405199	eng	Everything I've said is true.
3405201	eng	Is any of this true?
3405203	eng	This fell off a truck.
3405210	eng	You should cancel your trip.
3405211	eng	You shouldn't cancel your trip.
3405213	eng	That was a good trick.
3405214	eng	It could be a trick.
3405216	eng	Tom hid behind the tree.
3405218	eng	Tom is used to traveling.
3405222	eng	Tom never takes the train.

3519674	eng	They're going to find Tom.
3519675	eng	They're going to shoot Tom.
3519676	eng	They tried to handcuff Tom.
3519677	eng	They'll be looking for Tom.
3519681	eng	They walked back toward Tom.
3519724	eng	They haven't heard from Tom.
3519726	eng	They're all grinning at Tom.
3520021	eng	Unfortunately, that is the truth.
3520025	eng	The reason is very simple.
3520379	eng	They're going to torture Tom.
3520384	eng	They'll come looking for Tom.
3520459	eng	They began walking toward Tom.
3520463	eng	They crouched down beside Tom.
3520465	eng	They walked slowly towards Tom.
3520634	eng	They say Coca-Cola dissolves teeth.
3520857	eng	You have wounded my feelings.
3520861	eng	That's OK, Tom, it happens.
3521059	eng	Don't fall off your chair.
3521151	eng	I know you're quite busy.
3521172	eng	You shouldn't have written that.

3521827	eng	Did you apologize to Tom?
3521828	eng	Where did you send Tom?

3523508	eng	Maybe you should ask Tom.
3523513	eng	Maybe we should help Tom.
3523514	eng	Maybe we can help Tom.
3523573	eng	He doesn't greet his neighbours.

3523644	eng	Why did they fire Tom?
3523645	eng	Who's going to believe Tom?
3523646	eng	Were you jealous of Tom?
3523647	eng	Why are you calling Tom?

3525076	eng	Just call me "Your Majesty".
3525080	eng	I cannot concentrate at all.
3525088	eng	I'll go if Tom goes.
3525096	eng	How's your old man doing?
3525102	eng	I lost your phone number.
3525116	eng	Why should I even care?

3528174	eng	Just go back to bed.

3531326	eng	Tom didn't notice Mary leave.
3531327	eng	There's no one else left.
3531329	eng	Just get me the list.
3531371	eng	He briskly rejects my suggestion.
3531387	eng	Tom didn't like my suggestion.
3531405	eng	Did Tom really kill Mary?
3531643	eng	Looks aren't important to me.
3531752	eng	So what's on your mind?
3531753	eng	Say what's on your mind.
3531757	eng	We've missed you so much.
3531762	eng	That would be very nice.

3531920	eng	Just go to your room.
3531921	eng	There's nobody in your room.
3531922	eng	You don't follow the rules.

3533712	eng	"We're just friends," said Tom.
3533755	eng	You don't seem very surprised.

3561916	eng	May I ask another question?
3562374	eng	"But Mom!" "Don't 'mom' me."
3562461	eng	Someone has to help me.
3562463	eng	That car could've hit me.
3562492	eng	You should stay with me.
3562518	eng	Lemon and melon are anagrams.
3563505	eng	Why did they fire you?
3563506	eng	Why can't we work together?
3563508	eng	Why can't I do it?
3563605	eng	Guess what I was thinking.
3563609	eng	I need help doing this.
3563696	eng	I must organize my thoughts.
3563770	eng	Should I call the police?
3563779	eng	Now, please leave me alone.
3563780	eng	Now, let's play some baseball.
3563783	eng	Now, take a deep breath.
3563785	eng	Now, listen to me carefully.
3563787	eng	Now, let's not get discouraged.
3563791	eng	Now, get me a drink.
3563796	eng	Now, I need your help.
3563798	eng	Now, why are you here?
3563799	eng	Now, you'd better go home.
3563804	eng	Now, let me handle it.
3563805	eng	Now, shut up and listen.
3563806	eng	Now, let's have a look.
3563808	eng	Now, would you excuse me?
3563809	eng	Now, will you help me?
3563811	eng	Now, wait just a minute.
3563814	eng	Now, who has a question?
3563818	eng	Now, wait just a second.
3563820	eng	Now, hang on a second.
3563830	eng	Now, help me with this.
3563832	eng	Now, that's not so unusual.
3563918	eng	Tom has an insatiable appetite.
3564118	eng	I bet I finish first.
3564246	eng	Coprophagia is common in dogs.
3564361	eng	Friends are thieves of time.
3564744	eng	I'm having lots of fun.
3564968	eng	Here, let me do it.
3564969	eng	Maybe I can fix it.
3565033	eng	I like what I like.
3565055	eng	That seems risky to me.
3565062	eng	This is it. It's over!
3565077	eng	Here, put these gloves on.
3565086	eng	The game got rained out.
3565118	eng	Remember to shut the windows.
3565122	eng	We cannot change the past.
3565126	eng	What color is your dress?
3565826	eng	I do have a theory.
3565863	eng	We're all worried about Tom.
3567240	eng	Maybe you'd better call Tom.
3567242	eng	You're supposed to call Tom.
3567243	eng	I need help carrying Tom.
3567247	eng	Perhaps we should contact Tom.
3567344	eng	You're supposed to help Tom.
3568107	eng	We're here to rescue you.
3568408	eng	Your dog just bit me.
3568409	eng	You're taking an awful risk.
3568415	eng	What's that in your pocket?
3568422	eng	That's a funny looking car.
3568428	eng	Look at all these boxes.
3568433	eng	It was important to me.
3568434	eng	Is this guy bothering you?
3568435	eng	Is this cool or what?
3568436	eng	I've got the afternoon free.
3568439	eng	I'm not your lab assistant.
3568445	eng	I'll visit whenever I can.
3568446	eng	I thought you were leaving.
3568449	eng	I still think it's good.
3568451	eng	I really enjoyed the show.
3568453	eng	I heard the bad news.
3568454	eng	I have another good idea.
3568463	eng	How did the interview go?
3568464	eng	How did the audition go?
3568466	eng	Everyone has to do this.
3568467	eng	Don't get mad at us.
3568469	eng	Does this medicine really work?
3568470	eng	Do you want my job?
3568473	eng	Did you want to drive?
3568474	eng	Did I miss the turn?
3568476	eng	Can we use your ball?
3568477	eng	Can I hide in here?
3568478	eng	Be nice to the babysitter.
3568785	eng	Elves live in the forest.
3570070	eng	It smells weird, doesn't it?
3570077	eng	Valuation is not always objective.
3570325	eng	Today was a tough day.
3570326	eng	Today was a busy day.
3570619	eng	Ajay is a bad boy.
3571933	eng	Tell me a bedtime story.
3571943	eng	I'm not the jealous type.
3571966	eng	Just stop bugging me, okay?
3571967	eng	This building looks very futuristic.
3571969	eng	That place is always packed.
3573194	eng	Looks like I messed up.
3573326	eng	Can I escort you anywhere?
3573331	eng	Do I sound that pessimistic?
3573348	eng	Success can also be seductive.
3573354	eng	You can improve your performance.
3573387	eng	What did your mom say?
3573609	eng	I'm good friends with Tom.
3573710	eng	Take a sip of this.
3573720	eng	Did I wake you guys?
3573721	eng	Did I mess up again?
3573726	eng	I think I'll do that.
3573728	eng	Is that coffee I smell?
3573729	eng	Where have you two been?
3573730	eng	Were you at Tom's party?
3573731	eng	That reminds me of home.
3573732	eng	I could fix that easily.
3573733	eng	I could easily fix that.
3573738	eng	That's exactly what I said.
3573745	eng	When did this package arrive?
3573746	eng	We've been working all night.
3573752	eng	I really like your paintings.
3573765	eng	You've made your position clear.
3573775	eng	Shouldn't you be getting dressed?
3573956	eng	Charity is an important mitzvah.
3573990	eng	Thanks for doing the dishes.
3574447	eng	Such inconveniences can always happen.
3574593	eng	I won't participate in speculation.
3575070	eng	She sometimes helps her mother.
3575085	eng	He gets his diploma tomorrow.
3575347	eng	I'm so confused right now.
3575354	eng	Hey, I can't help you.
3575356	eng	Hey, let me help you.
3575359	eng	Hey, I'm talking to you.
3575361	eng	Hey, what's wrong with you?
3575362	eng	Hey, we aren't done yet.
3575364	eng	Hey, it could be worse.
3575370	eng	Hey, what're you listening to?
3575371	eng	Hey, look at the time.
3575373	eng	Hey, Tom, look at this.
3575377	eng	Hey, get away from there.
3575378	eng	Hey, let's go in there.
3575382	eng	Hey, what's that over there?
3575383	eng	Hey, can I have that?
3575384	eng	Hey, did you hear that?
3575388	eng	Hey, we'd better get started.
3575390	eng	Hey, look at the snow.
3575392	eng	Hey, I'm on your side.
3575393	eng	Hey, long time no see.
3575394	eng	Hey, hold on a second.
3575398	eng	Hey, is everything all right?
3575404	eng	Hey, you only live once.
3575407	eng	Hey, you can't leave now.
3575409	eng	Hey, what's all the noise?
3575416	eng	Hey, did you hear me?
3575424	eng	Hey, what do I know?
3575428	eng	Hey, I can handle it.
3575431	eng	Hey, I have an idea.
3575436	eng	Hey, that's a good idea.
3575438	eng	Hey, that's a great idea.
3575439	eng	Hey, what a great idea!
3575441	eng	Hey, I just got here.
3575446	eng	Hey, what's going on here?
3575451	eng	Hey, thanks for the help.
3575453	eng	Hey, I need your help.
3575455	eng	Hey, that was really great.
3575456	eng	Hey, look what I've got.
3575463	eng	Hey, look what I found.
3575464	eng	Hey, what are friends for?
3575468	eng	Hey, I need a favor.
3575474	eng	Hey, look what I'm doing.
3575476	eng	Hey, I'm not a doctor.
3575481	eng	Hey, why are you crying?
3575482	eng	Hey, that's kind of cool.
3575490	eng	Hey, get off my bike.
3575493	eng	Hey, it's not so bad.
3575494	eng	Hey, I'll be right back.
3575497	eng	Hey, what's behind your back?
3576655	eng	We suffered a devastating loss.
3576947	eng	She has an indefinite contract.
3577037	eng	That is my favorite song!
3577164	eng	A right friend you are!
3577525	eng	What is Tom's real purpose?
3577540	eng	I quickly emailed him back.
3578734	eng	Sea turtles are magnificent creatures.
3579029	eng	Olivia and Emma are friends.
3579079	eng	Maya and Chloe are friends.
3579486	eng	They passed notes in class.
3579623	eng	I tried to act natural.
3579651	eng	He's a very sweet guy.
3579671	eng	Tom is a law-abiding citizen.
3579732	eng	He is not a child.
3579790	eng	Mary is tall and strong.
3579799	eng	Thus fought the Okinawan people.
3580301	eng	I know how to samba!
3580983	eng	Unfortunately, the system is corrupted.
3581009	eng	Never call someone a terrorist.
3581014	eng	Did you call me fat?
3581018	eng	You're always playing computer games.
3581038	eng	Kathleen is studying linear algebra.
3581056	eng	Aimee's in the bathroom now.
3581300	eng	This is a mobile phone.
3581909	eng	Mary was not badly injured.
3581929	eng	Tom was expelled from preschool.
3582471	eng	Tom sipped at his drink.
3582596	eng	He knows all the answers.
3582620	eng	The commander called reinforcements up.
3582717	eng	He is still at large.
3583248	eng	How old is your child?
3583290	eng	Have you ever played hooky?
3583291	eng	Have you ever skipped school?
3583311	eng	Can I touch your chest?
3583312	eng	Can I touch your breasts?
3583325	eng	When does fishing season start?
3583330	eng	What is everyone clapping about?
3583341	eng	What is making this sound?
3583366	eng	Does Australia have four seasons?
3584860	eng	Chiqui is a good parrot.
3584869	eng	This parrot has green feathers.
3584871	eng	Don't try to bullshit me.
3584872	eng	Why is life so difficult?
3584873	eng	Why is love so difficult?
3584929	eng	Autistic children never get bored.
3587702	eng	Love loves to love love.
3587858	eng	I will be right over.
3587899	eng	Can I do this later?
3588121	eng	I enjoyed working with Tom.
3588825	eng	It is simple as fuck.
3589252	eng	Minus and minus is plus.
3589868	eng	It turned out dead easy.
3590503	eng	This dress fits me perfectly.
3590504	eng	It looks fabulous on you!
3590535	eng	Let me pay for it.
3590604	eng	Tom, stop pulling my hair!
3590605	eng	His parents are very conservative.
3590617	eng	We wear the same size.
3590843	eng	How can I repay you?
3590844	eng	How did they find out?
3590845	eng	I do need your help.
3590854	eng	I still have to try.
3590923	eng	Do not drink the water!
3590956	eng	That's not at all funny.
3590973	eng	That boy looks like Tom.
3590977	eng	That cost me a fortune.
3591008	eng	That was a nice speech.
3591019	eng	It's only a temporary fix.
3591020	eng	That's a very bad idea.
3591024	eng	That's all I have left.
3591025	eng	That's also a bad idea.
3591032	eng	That's not a bad guess.
3591033	eng	That's not a bad start.
3591050	eng	That looked like it hurt.
3591080	eng	That's not funny at all.
3591082	eng	That's not what I think.
3591083	eng	That's not why I'm here.
3591084	eng	That's real nice of you.
3591090	eng	That could come in handy.
3591091	eng	That looks like it hurts.
3591099	eng	That seems to make sense.
3591111	eng	Tom may not be dead.
3591113	eng	That sounds like a train.
3591119	eng	That wouldn't be any fun.
3591120	eng	That'll take a long time.
3591126	eng	That's a very good point.
3591138	eng	That's a really good point.
3591140	eng	That's kind of the point.
3591142	eng	That's really not the point.
3591143	eng	That's not really the point.
3591144	eng	That's sort of the point.
3591170	eng	That's not a good choice.
3591172	eng	That's not nearly good enough.
3591173	eng	That's not really good enough.
3591174	eng	That cake was really good.
3591177	eng	That's a really good hospital.
3591185	eng	That's probably a good idea.
3591191	eng	That's a really good painting.
3591195	eng	That's a good story, Tom.
3591257	eng	That's not important right now.
3591281	eng	That was everything I had.
3591282	eng	That's how I do everything.
3591339	eng	That's what you've always wanted.
3591340	eng	That's what you should do.
3591341	eng	That's what you always do.
3591345	eng	That's very thoughtful of you.
3591473	eng	The light has turned green.
3591616	eng	That's why I'm here today.
3591618	eng	That's why I brought this.
3591623	eng	That's why I'm a bachelor.
3591635	eng	That's what I thought, too.
3591637	eng	That's what I was thinking.
3591640	eng	That's what I always say.
3591641	eng	That's what I should've said.
3591643	eng	That's what I'm counting on.
3591644	eng	That's what I'm frightened of.
3591645	eng	That's what I'm afraid of.
3591649	eng	That's what I'm here for.
3591651	eng	That's what I usually do.
3591661	eng	That's what I'm worried about.
3591669	eng	That's exactly what I expected.
3591671	eng	That's just what I thought.
3591672	eng	That's all I was thinking.
3591674	eng	That's exactly what I think.
3591675	eng	That's how I like things.
3591681	eng	That's exactly what I'm saying.
3591682	eng	That's exactly what I'd say.
3591688	eng	That's exactly what I needed.
3591692	eng	That's precisely what I meant.
3591693	eng	That's the choice I made.
3591696	eng	That's really all I know.
3591700	eng	That wasn't what I intended.
3591704	eng	That's not where I'm going.
3591708	eng	That's exactly how I feel.
3591709	eng	That's exactly what I expect.
3591710	eng	That's more than I expected.
3591716	eng	That's all I'm thinking about.
3591753	eng	That's where I went yesterday.
3591762	eng	That's the reason I'm here.
3591776	eng	That's how I planned it.
3591778	eng	That's exactly what I've needed.
3592039	eng	Your phone is ringing again.
3592189	eng	How do these things work?
3592197	eng	How do I explain this?
3592198	eng	How do we explain this?
3592202	eng	How do you remember that?
3592203	eng	How do you prove that?
3592226	eng	How do you explain it?
3592615	eng	What are you studying about?
3592858	eng	Tom said he'd kill you.
3592861	eng	Tom is calling for you.
3592863	eng	Tom said he'd call you.
3592870	eng	Tom is going to town.
3592881	eng	Tom is kind of needy.
3592885	eng	Tom said you'd phone me.
3592889	eng	Tom says he'll hurt me.
3592890	eng	That's between Tom and me.
3592891	eng	Tom sang better than Mary.
3592892	eng	Does Tom still love Mary?
3592893	eng	Tom tried to embrace Mary.
3592894	eng	Tom tried to console Mary.
3592895	eng	Tom is a married man.
3592913	eng	Tom looks like a cowboy.
3592916	eng	Tom came home by bus.
3592920	eng	Tom owes me an apology.
3593274	eng	The castle might be haunted.
3593341	eng	Amelia Earhart was an aviatrix.
3593450	eng	I'm doing the right thing.
3593451	eng	Is Mary prettier than me?
3593456	eng	We don't need you anymore.
3593616	eng	Haven't you eaten lunch yet?
3593650	eng	When did you quit smoking?
3593977	eng	That only makes it worse.
3593978	eng	That's what's got me worried.
3593980	eng	That's a lot of work.
3593984	eng	That's all I ever wanted.
3593994	eng	That's a very interesting theory.
3593996	eng	That's a very nice suit.
3594000	eng	That was quite a speech.
3594002	eng	That's a very good sign.
3594003	eng	That's a real long shot.
3594009	eng	That's all you ever say.
3594012	eng	That's all I can say.
3594015	eng	That was kind of rude.
3594017	eng	That's a lot to remember.
3594021	eng	That's all I can promise.
3594028	eng	That's what makes me nervous.
3594036	eng	That was kind of mean.
3594040	eng	That's not what worries me.
3594046	eng	That hadn't occurred to me.
3594049	eng	That did occur to me.
3594052	eng	That ball could've hit me.
3594053	eng	That seems like a lot.
3594054	eng	That might take too long.
3594060	eng	That's why I did it.
3594063	eng	That's how I see it.
3594064	eng	That's how I did it.
3594065	eng	That isn't much, is it?
3594067	eng	That's not how it is.
3594075	eng	That's a lot of help.
3594090	eng	That looks kind of fun.
3594092	eng	That's all I could find.
3594102	eng	That's for me to decide.
3594103	eng	That's what's driving me crazy.
3594105	eng	That's a lot to consider.
3594106	eng	That's a very nice coat.
3594108	eng	That's a lot of cash.
3594111	eng	That cost me three bucks.
3594113	eng	That makes me feel better.
3594118	eng	That's all I can ask.
3594119	eng	That was three weeks ago.
3594759	eng	I want my hammer back.
3595016	eng	Have you got an appointment?
3595273	eng	So, why are you here?
3596328	eng	Do we have free will?
3596385	eng	Have you ever driven stickshift?
3596386	eng	Have you ever driven manual?
3596579	eng	My favourite biscuit is Singoalla.
3596794	eng	You are always pissed off.
3596811	eng	Smoking is a disgusting habit.
3596976	eng	It's a matter of taste.
3596977	eng	It's a matter of survival.
3596979	eng	It's a matter of priorities.
3596980	eng	It's a matter of principle.
3597098	eng	I'd rather do this alone.
3597114	eng	I've already tried that once.
3597326	eng	I don't really need this.
3597385	eng	There are no more bullets.
3597391	eng	We've run out of ammunition.
3597392	eng	We've run out of food.

3721318	eng	Tom is carrying an umbrella.
3721325	eng	Tom makes a good jambalaya.
3721345	eng	That's part of our job.
3721351	eng	You've done a brilliant job.
3721355	eng	Tom fumbled with the doorknob.
3721359	eng	Let's just take a sec.
3721370	eng	Stay away from the clinic.
3721373	eng	Tom cranked up the music.
3721376	eng	Tom tends to be overdramatic.
3721377	eng	You were always the romantic.
3721380	eng	I must do something drastic.
3721383	eng	Not all aliens are bad.
3721388	eng	Tom wants it so bad.
3721391	eng	It's really not so bad.
3721399	eng	Tom is listed as dead.
3721400	eng	We're as good as dead.
3721411	eng	Tom completely lost his head.
3721414	eng	You really should've phoned ahead.
3721417	eng	Tom is a real hothead.
3721424	eng	I've got boxes to unload.
3721428	eng	You're all over the road.
3721435	eng	Tom sat up in bed.
3721446	eng	The carts were being loaded.
3721449	eng	Tom's fate is already decided.
3721455	eng	The prison is heavily guarded.
3721463	eng	You've got mouths to feed.
3721490	eng	Tom looked up and laughed.
3721495	eng	I have to be punished.
3721497	eng	The room became slightly hushed.
3721498	eng	Tom looks a little flushed.
3721506	eng	I'm not convinced that's justified.
3721525	eng	It's time you two talked.
3721528	eng	Not all cops are crooked.
3721530	eng	That isn't what I asked.
3721531	eng	I've done as you've asked.
3721533	eng	The truth couldn't be concealed.
3721535	eng	Tom's birth records are sealed.
3721536	eng	The leak has been sealed.
3721545	eng	Tom leaned back and smiled.
3721546	eng	Tom sat back and smiled.
3721560	eng	I could have you killed.
3721563	eng	I've never been so thrilled.
3721564	eng	You sure had me fooled.
3721567	eng	Tom was a little startled.
3721569	eng	You've got me all rattled.
3721571	eng	That's what had me puzzled.
3721577	eng	Tom wasn't a bit alarmed.
3721579	eng	Tom's doubts have been confirmed.
3721580	eng	Tom is amazingly well informed.
3721585	eng	It's like nothing ever happened.
3721597	eng	It doesn't change what happened.
3721614	eng	Tom's patience is being strained.
3721615	eng	Tom has been unavoidably detained.
3721622	eng	The pigeons were all poisoned.
3721627	eng	Tom stood up and clapped.
3721630	eng	Boy is my face red.
3721632	eng	Tom was good and scared.
3721637	eng	I can't believe you remembered.
3721640	eng	Tom appeared to be bewildered.
3721652	eng	Tom knocked and Mary answered.
3721656	eng	Tom will eventually get tired.
3721658	eng	Tom was suddenly very tired.
3721660	eng	Tom was just getting bored.
3721667	eng	No one will be released.
3721668	eng	Tom will be so pleased.
3721669	eng	You must be very pleased.
3721679	eng	Tom's ego has been bruised.
3721681	eng	The door was still closed.
3721688	eng	Tom is almost fully dressed.
3721696	eng	Tom was a little confused.
3721699	eng	Tom is now genuinely confused.
3721702	eng	I'm not that easily intimidated.
3721704	eng	The report may be exaggerated.
3721705	eng	You're about to be exonerated.
3721706	eng	I hope you're well compensated.
3721712	eng	I know Tom is connected.
3721715	eng	You aren't what I expected.
3721716	eng	It was to be expected.
3721723	eng	Tom takes everything for granted.
3721724	eng	Tom seemed a little disoriented.
3721731	eng	Tell me you were adopted.
3721732	eng	Please tell me I'm adopted.
3721736	eng	Tom began to get downhearted.
3721738	eng	Now look what you've started.
3721748	eng	Tom wasn't a bit interested.
3721754	eng	You should have Tom arrested.
3721755	eng	We should have you arrested.
3721764	eng	You've exceeded the time allotted.
3721768	eng	Tom looked pale and fatigued.
3721771	eng	You must be deeply relieved.
3721772	eng	Life needs to be lived.
3721780	eng	It's a miracle you survived.
3721783	eng	I know Tom is involved.
3721788	eng	I've never felt so loved.
3721789	eng	Tom and Mary never moved.
3721800	eng	I hope you're well paid.
3721803	eng	Tell me you're not afraid.
3721805	eng	That's what the papers said.
3721809	eng	Tom confirmed what Mary said.
3721833	eng	Tom is hardly a child.
3721834	eng	I must be getting old.
3721835	eng	I guess we're getting old.
3721841	eng	Tom is still out cold.
3721842	eng	The water was icy cold.
3721847	eng	I'm putting you on hold.
3721853	eng	Tom did what he could.
3721858	eng	Tom held up his hand.
3721862	eng	Tom put me in command.
3721869	eng	None of them could understand.
3721886	eng	We want that to end.
3721909	eng	This is the good kind.
3721920	eng	Tom has a brilliant mind.
3721922	eng	I haven't lost my mind.
3721923	eng	You've got a dirty mind.
3721940	eng	I knew you'd come around.
3721941	eng	Tom has been looking around.
3721943	eng	We were just screwing around.
3721946	eng	What goes around, comes around.
3721947	eng	Well, I'll see you around.
3721948	eng	Tom loves having Mary around.
3721949	eng	Tom stomped on the ground.
3721952	eng	Tom looked at the ground.
3721957	eng	I don't like alcohol, period.
3721960	eng	It's a waste of food.
3721964	eng	This ought to be good.
3721968	eng	Let's make this look good.
3721974	eng	Tom isn't looking too good.
3721975	eng	That wouldn't look so good.
3721978	eng	That massage felt so good.
3721982	eng	I think ambition is good.
3721986	eng	I don't feel that good.
3721989	eng	It would do you good.
3721992	eng	That would be very good.
3721993	eng	It doesn't look very good.
3721994	eng	Tom is looking pretty good.
3722000	eng	Somebody's in a good mood.
3722005	eng	I couldn't make myself heard.
3722009	eng	Tom is trying real hard.
3722014	eng	Tom is under 24-hour guard.
3722018	eng	Let's give Tom his reward.
3722021	eng	They branded you a coward.
3722027	eng	Tell me this isn't weird.
3722028	eng	This is off the record.
3722029	eng	I have a juvenile record.
3722030	eng	Tom has no prison record.
3722032	eng	I won't breathe a word.
3722034	eng	Don't you say a word.
3722035	eng	You said the magic word.
3722040	eng	I just got the word.
3722050	eng	Tom pushed through the crowd.
3722051	eng	Tom emerged from the crowd.
3722054	eng	That's as it should be.
3722063	eng	You should've seen your face.
3722071	eng	Tom finished drying his face.
3722080	eng	Tom looks out of place.
3722095	eng	Tom leaned against the mantelpiece.
3722096	eng	I gave at the office.
3722120	eng	Tom clearly has no choice.
3722121	eng	That leaves us no choice.
3722128	eng	I didn't raise my voice.
3722129	eng	We all have a price.
3722140	eng	You can ask any price.
3722157	eng	Tom jumped at the chance.
3722158	eng	I won't get the chance.
3722159	eng	There is but one chance.
3722162	eng	You were my last chance.
3722167	eng	Tom was in a trance.
3722169	eng	I've already spent my inheritance.
3722182	eng	Tom was on the fence.
3722187	eng	That hasn't been my experience.
3722189	eng	There was a dead silence.
3722191	eng	There was an awkward silence.
3722196	eng	There was a brief silence.
3722197	eng	There was a long silence.
3722198	eng	Tom broke the long silence.
3722205	eng	That makes all the difference.
3722206	eng	Tom never knew the difference.
3722207	eng	There's a lot of difference.
3722210	eng	Tom isn't questioning your competence.
3722218	eng	Tom didn't reply at once.
3722221	eng	The choice has been made.
3722226	eng	Tom teaches the third grade.
3722227	eng	That would help me decide.
3722236	eng	Thanks for saving my hide.
3722241	eng	You're on the wrong side.
3722247	eng	Look on the bright side.
3722249	eng	The law's on my side.
3722251	eng	Tom is still parked outside.
3722255	eng	Tom opened his eyes wide.
3722256	eng	You've got the wrong code.
3722258	eng	That's a very enlightened attitude.
3722259	eng	You just need some coffee.
3722262	eng	Tom was happy and carefree.
3722268	eng	Now you've got all three.
3722274	eng	This I have to see.
3722291	eng	We can't be too safe.
3722292	eng	Tom always plays it safe.
3722303	eng	That'll cost you your life.
3722317	eng	You're part of my life.
3722328	eng	I have an understanding wife.
3722338	eng	It's a green card marriage.
3722339	eng	I know all about marriage.
3722341	eng	I think we can manage.
3722344	eng	Tom printed out the page.
3722345	eng	We're on the same page.
3722347	eng	You made the front page.
3722351	eng	Tom handed Mary the message.
3722353	eng	You've always had an advantage.
3722355	eng	I had no such knowledge.
3722356	eng	Tom leaned over the bridge.
3722363	eng	I can feel the change.
3722372	eng	Some things will never change.
3722374	eng	Tom is really acting strange.
3722378	eng	Tom rose to the challenge.
3722380	eng	I gladly accept your challenge.
3722383	eng	The group was too large.
3722386	eng	Tom had a bad headache.
3722388	eng	I had a severe headache.
3722389	eng	I had a splitting headache.
3722390	eng	Tom walks like a zombie.
3722402	eng	Tom is a tough cookie.
3722403	eng	Tom is one tough cookie.
3722405	eng	That would be a lie.
3722406	eng	I can't tell a lie.
3722410	eng	Tom is a sweetie pie.
3722411	eng	I don't need a tie.
3722424	eng	There's too much at stake.
3722429	eng	It was an honest mistake.
3722430	eng	That was an honest mistake.
3722432	eng	That's the part I like.
3722446	eng	Tom laughed at the joke.
3722448	eng	This is somebody's sick joke.
3722449	eng	Tom had a minor stroke.
3722465	eng	I know someone who's available.
3722472	eng	I don't need a table.
3722479	eng	Get that off my table.
3722480	eng	Tom tends to be unpredictable.
3722483	eng	I was just being hospitable.
3722485	eng	If anything happens, I'm accountable.
3722494	eng	Tom's voice was hardly audible.
3722501	eng	Tell me how that's possible.
3722502	eng	I guess theoretically it's possible.
3722508	eng	I've done everything humanly possible.
3722512	eng	Tom says we're not compatible.
3722515	eng	I'll make yours a double.
3722517	eng	I'll save you the trouble.
3722530	eng	Tom knew this meant trouble.
3722531	eng	It's been nothing but trouble.
3722536	eng	Tom hopped on his motorcycle.
3722539	eng	It cost me a bundle.
3722540	eng	Tom tossed Mary a rifle.
3722544	eng	Tom disappeared into the jungle.
3722546	eng	Let me have the file.
3722547	eng	Tom went through the file.
3722550	eng	That could take a while.
3722553	eng	Tom continued after a while.
3722566	eng	Tom didn't crack a smile.
3722570	eng	Tom peeked out the peephole.
3722578	eng	You have your orders, people.
3722580	eng	Tom has murdered three people.
3722583	eng	I take care of people.
3722586	eng	I don't like upsetting people.
3722587	eng	I enjoy communicating with people.
3722592	eng	Tom is surrounded by people.
3722595	eng	We make quite a couple.
3722600	eng	I don't need a whistle.
3722601	eng	I'm clean as a whistle.
3722602	eng	I won't blow the whistle.
3722607	eng	It scares me a little.
3722608	eng	Tom drew back a little.
3722612	eng	Tom quickly hid the bottle.
3722647	eng	You're attempting to confuse me.
3722654	eng	That's why you love me.
3722663	eng	It was selfish of me.
3722672	eng	Thanks for not telling me.
3722683	eng	Maybe something's wrong with me.
3722684	eng	That's totally cool with me.
3722694	eng	That's what people call me.
3722700	eng	Tom hid things from me.
3722706	eng	No one believes in me.
3722714	eng	The cab ride's on me.
3722724	eng	You're so attracted to me.
3722731	eng	Apologies mean nothing to me.
3722733	eng	Tom meant everything to me.
3722735	eng	Please come back to me.
3722740	eng	Now you listen to me.
3722745	eng	This isn't fair to me.
3722746	eng	They did things to me.
3722771	eng	That goes double for me.
3722774	eng	Tom was there for me.
3722788	eng	Don't ruin it for me.
3722803	eng	I think Tom suspects me.
3722806	eng	Tom looked up at me.
3722808	eng	Tom looked straight at me.
3722809	eng	Tom looked right at me.
3722814	eng	I guess you've caught me.
3722831	eng	You couldn't live without me.
3722834	eng	That's not why I came.
3722838	eng	You're intentionally throwing the game.
3722839	eng	You can't watch the game.
3722848	eng	That's not my real name.
3722852	eng	We'll never be the same.
3722854	eng	It doesn't look the same.
3722855	eng	It's just not the same.
3722868	eng	Tom laughed all the time.
3722876	eng	You need to make time.
3722886	eng	I owe you big time.
3722903	eng	Tom was playing for time.
3722915	eng	There's always a first time.
3722917	eng	It's not my first time.
3722919	eng	It was before my time.
3722920	eng	You're seriously wasting my time.
3722929	eng	Welcome to our humble home.
3722930	eng	I need to come home.
3722938	eng	It's too close to home.
3722942	eng	Have a safe journey home.
3722943	eng	Tom is indeed quite handsome.
3722957	eng	They're going to be fine.
3722966	eng	That'll keep Tom in line.
3722969	eng	It's going to be mine.
3722978	eng	Tom never varies his routine.
3722995	eng	It's back to square one.
3723001	eng	You can't handle another one.
3723018	eng	I totally owe you one.
3723026	eng	Tom, look what you've done.
3723034	eng	Tom looks pretty far gone.
3723040	eng	Tom groggily answered the phone.
3723048	eng	It's better to be alone.
3723052	eng	I had a kidney stone.
3723056	eng	This will hardly convince anyone.
3723060	eng	Tom didn't dare tell anyone.
3723070	eng	Tom is well-liked by everyone.
3723074	eng	Tom is wearing a stethoscope.
3723078	eng	I had one last hope.
3723079	eng	You were our last hope.
3723084	eng	Tom cautiously opened the envelope.
3723088	eng	We are what we are.
3723101	eng	Tell us where they are.
3723106	eng	You're going to require care.
3723108	eng	I believe you do care.
3723110	eng	Tell me why you care.
3723111	eng	There was a bomb scare.
3723112	eng	I'm not living on welfare.
3723118	eng	You won, fair and square.
3723123	eng	Hey, I'm practically naked here.
3723126	eng	I want guards posted here.
3723135	eng	I like the people here.
3723139	eng	That's why we came here.
3723148	eng	I happen to live here.
3723149	eng	I'll let you off here.
3723151	eng	I'm busting out of here.
3723158	eng	That's what I'm doing here.
3723160	eng	I'm perfectly comfortable waiting here.
3723163	eng	You can't be back here.
3723169	eng	We're not in control here.
3723176	eng	You two get in here.
3723177	eng	I'm very busy in here.
3723182	eng	You can't be down here.
3723191	eng	You're not a prisoner here.
3723202	eng	I've got proof right here.
3723207	eng	That's how I got here.
3723210	eng	I think Tom slept here.
3723222	eng	We're in uncharted territory here.
3723229	eng	Tom just left me there.
3723238	eng	I know you're back there.
3723251	eng	Hey, you can't sleep there.
3723255	eng	That's why I was there.
3723266	eng	It's a scorcher out there.
3723267	eng	There are wolves out there.
3723269	eng	I can get you there.
3723271	eng	Everyone has to be somewhere.
3723272	eng	Everybody has to be somewhere.
3723273	eng	I've got to be somewhere.
3723287	eng	I can work from anywhere.
3723290	eng	They seem to be everywhere.
3723296	eng	Tom tended to the fire.
3723298	eng	Tom is a new hire.
3723309	eng	I've seen that look before.
3723328	eng	Tom could say nothing more.
3723329	eng	Tom could do no more.
3723330	eng	Tom could say no more.
3723331	eng	I have a lot more.
3723332	eng	I had to know more.
3723336	eng	I don't practice medicine anymore.
3723338	eng	I can't help myself anymore.
3723340	eng	I can't stand lying anymore.
3723348	eng	Tom was impossible to ignore.
3723352	eng	I don't need the brochure.
3723354	eng	I needed to be sure.
3723355	eng	This is an unexpected pleasure.
3723357	eng	Tom has a forgiving nature.
3723358	eng	It doesn't exist in nature.
3723367	eng	The opposite is the case.
3723370	eng	Tom is carrying a briefcase.
3723371	eng	Don't leave me again, please.
3723373	eng	Tom examined the new purchase.
3723386	eng	That was a fun surprise.
3723388	eng	Tom's face showed his surprise.
3723393	eng	Tom was killed someplace else.
3723402	eng	Tom couldn't go anywhere else.
3723403	eng	You're destined for something else.
3723406	eng	I'll tell you something else.
3723425	eng	I've got many of those.
3723426	eng	Tom was paid to lose.
3723438	eng	You're backing the wrong horse.
3723452	eng	We're giving you the house.
3723454	eng	I eventually located Tom's house.
3723460	eng	I'm playing the devil's advocate.
3723461	eng	I don't need a date.
3723471	eng	I will accept my fate.
3723472	eng	Tom exited through the gate.
3723479	eng	That could be too late.
3723487	eng	I don't need a plate.
3723493	eng	I know how you operate.
3723503	eng	It's never black and white.
3723505	eng	It's not black and white.
3723506	eng	Half the suspects were white.
3723508	eng	I feel like a hypocrite.
3723509	eng	Tom glanced at the note.
3723511	eng	I call for a vote.
3723513	eng	I'm not changing my vote.
3723525	eng	Come downstairs right this minute.
3723527	eng	There's one born every minute.
3723534	eng	Tom is in the morgue.
3723535	eng	That was the first clue.
3723536	eng	It just can't be true.
3723546	eng	I don't need a tissue.
3723547	eng	Tom appeared from the cave.
3723572	eng	You shouldn't still be alive.
3723574	eng	That's why I'm still alive.
3723576	eng	I've never felt so alive.
3723578	eng	Tom will eat you alive.
3723580	eng	I've never done anything impulsive.
3723582	eng	We must take the offensive.
3723586	eng	Tom is obedient, almost submissive.
3723593	eng	Tom is being held captive.
3723594	eng	I've always fought to survive.
3723598	eng	I'm definitely falling in love.
3723604	eng	Tom is on the move.
3723605	eng	This is the right move.
3723620	eng	I came by to apologize.
3723621	eng	Tom might at least apologize.
3723627	eng	Tom coughed into his handkerchief.
3723632	eng	This is such a relief.
3723634	eng	Tom's face showed his relief.
3723636	eng	I'll make this very brief.
3723640	eng	Tom is pretty bad off.
3723645	eng	Tom's classmates are goofing off.
3723646	eng	Tom couldn't help showing off.
3723648	eng	Tom was definitely bought off.
3723652	eng	I didn't rip you off.
3723668	eng	Tom tried to prepare himself.
3723671	eng	Tom was ashamed of himself.
3723672	eng	Tom was sure of himself.
3723675	eng	Tom looks pleased with himself.
3723677	eng	Tom's very pleased with himself.
3723680	eng	Tom lost confidence in himself.
3723689	eng	You're not so bad yourself.
3723693	eng	You must be kicking yourself.
3723703	eng	You even said that yourself.
3723706	eng	The cycle is repeating itself.
3723713	eng	I've only been fooling myself.
3723714	eng	I can live with myself.
3723725	eng	I could kill you myself.
3723732	eng	Mary rummaged through her bag.
3723735	eng	Tom was waving a flag.
3723743	eng	They think we're a gang.
3723748	eng	It doesn't look too convincing.
3723751	eng	I'm usually better at reading.
3723752	eng	I might need some persuading.
3723758	eng	I don't require your understanding.
3723759	eng	Tom isn't good at pretending.
3723764	eng	Tom could hear steps approaching.
3723766	eng	Tom's left eye started twitching.
3723775	eng	That's probably a good thing.
3723777	eng	Tom orchestrated this whole thing.
3723779	eng	That isn't the same thing.
3723787	eng	You're right about one thing.
3723796	eng	You've done a marvelous thing.
3723800	eng	I thought you jury-rigged something.
3723801	eng	Tom has indeed found something.
3723802	eng	I think we found something.
3723813	eng	It's got to mean something.
3723815	eng	Tom was munching on something.
3723819	eng	I need to confess something.
3723820	eng	Maybe that'll tell us something.
3723823	eng	It might tell us something.
3723825	eng	I knew I felt something.
3723826	eng	Tell me you've got something.
3723830	eng	That should tell you something.
3723833	eng	I had to say something.
3723837	eng	Tom is perplexed by something.
3723840	eng	The fight had settled nothing.
3723851	eng	Tom is good for nothing.
3723853	eng	I'm sure it was nothing.
3723860	eng	I'm afraid to touch anything.
3723862	eng	Try not to steal anything.
3723864	eng	Nobody could tell Tom anything.
3723870	eng	Tom hasn't picked up anything.
3723879	eng	Nobody's going to try anything.
3723885	eng	I'm going to make everything.
3723889	eng	That's Tom's answer for everything.
3723905	eng	The other kids aren't talking.
3723907	eng	I've been doing some thinking.
3723914	eng	They were out late drinking.
3723918	eng	You're really tall and good-looking.
3723922	eng	You know what I'm asking.
3723928	eng	I don't need any counseling.
3723938	eng	Someone knew we were coming.
3723942	eng	You all had this coming.
3723945	eng	You should've seen this coming.
3723946	eng	I never saw that coming.
3723949	eng	You should've seen it coming.
3723951	eng	That's what I find alarming.
3723956	eng	I should've anticipated this happening.
3723988	eng	That's just what I'm doing.
3723989	eng	This is your own doing.
3723991	eng	That's what I was doing.
3724001	eng	You have very acute hearing.
3724002	eng	I know what you're offering.
3724003	eng	I can end your suffering.
3724010	eng	Tom may need some doctoring.
3724012	eng	Tom is incapable of losing.
3724015	eng	You need to stop obsessing.
3724021	eng	That was really quite amusing.
3724028	eng	I can't believe you're graduating.
3724031	eng	I know who you're protecting.
3724043	eng	Tom really likes your painting.
3724046	eng	I just realized something interesting.
3724053	eng	Don't tell me you're quitting.
3724054	eng	You'll get nowhere by shouting.
3724056	eng	Every life is worth saving.
3724058	eng	Tom works for a living.
3724062	eng	That's really a good carving.
3724065	eng	There was soft music playing.
3724081	eng	Tom just can't stop crying.
3724092	eng	That would take too long.
3724100	eng	I think we'll tag along.
3724105	eng	You two would get along.
3724116	eng	You've got me all wrong.
3724118	eng	It just seems so wrong.
3724124	eng	Of course, you weren't wrong.
3724127	eng	Tom and Mary were young.
3724137	eng	I chose the wrong approach.
3724140	eng	Tom let out a belch.
3724143	eng	Tom is progressing in French.
3724146	eng	Tom complained of the stench.
3724147	eng	That'll do in a pinch.
3724150	eng	I'm still free for lunch.
3724155	eng	Tom is quite the catch.
3724158	eng	I'll take the first watch.
3724164	eng	It doesn't look like much.
3724165	eng	It doesn't bother me much.
3724169	eng	This is just too much.
3724171	eng	You give me so much.
3724174	eng	Tom loves you so much.
3724176	eng	I had suspected as much.
3724179	eng	I didn't learn very much.
3724180	eng	Tom liked Mary very much.
3724181	eng	Tom slumped on the couch.
3724187	eng	I think you've helped enough.
3724189	eng	That better be good enough.
3724190	eng	I'm just not good enough.
3724200	eng	Sometimes that just isn't enough.
3724205	eng	I think you'll pull through.
3724214	eng	I know I'm being selfish.
3724225	eng	It scares me to death.
3724232	eng	Tom drew a long breath.
3724233	eng	Tom drew a deep breath.
3724234	eng	Tom drew a sharp breath.
3724235	eng	Tom drew in his breath.
3724236	eng	I won't hold my breath.
3724262	eng	You're grounded for a month.
3724300	eng	I just tell the truth.
3724307	eng	We already know the truth.
3724308	eng	You already know the truth.
3724310	eng	Tom makes an excellent martini.
3724311	eng	Tom hailed a cruising taxi.
3724315	eng	Tom forced himself to speak.
3724318	eng	Tom wanted Mary to speak.
3724332	eng	I can be laid back.
3724335	eng	That's why I came back.
3724347	eng	It's great having you back.
3724354	eng	We've suffered a minor setback.
3724357	eng	The door opened a crack.
3724359	eng	We'd never survive another attack.
3724360	eng	We must continue our attack.
3724366	eng	Tom is a total wreck.
3724368	eng	It could've been a trick.
3724369	eng	That was a dirty trick.
3724370	eng	Tom will be worried sick.
3724371	eng	You've had me worried sick.
3724373	eng	This stuff makes me sick.
3724374	eng	You're making us all sick.
3724381	eng	I can make this quick.
3724382	eng	Tom is almost in shock.
3724385	eng	You missed your ten o'clock.
3724389	eng	I think we're in luck.
3724390	eng	I make my own luck.
3724393	eng	I couldn't believe my luck.
3724401	eng	I knew people would talk.
3724406	eng	Tom is here to talk.
3724407	eng	People are going to talk.
3724408	eng	People are starting to talk.
3724417	eng	I didn't rob any bank.
3724418	eng	Tom's face suddenly went blank.
3724425	eng	You're better than you think.
3724426	eng	I'm back in the pink.
3724441	eng	It's a piece of junk.
3724442	eng	You smell like a drunk.
3724451	eng	Tom glanced at the book.
3724453	eng	Tom is an open book.
3724462	eng	Tom couldn't help but look.
3724463	eng	Ha, I made you look.
3724469	eng	Tom laughed at the remark.
3724471	eng	Tom is obviously a jerk.
3724474	eng	Stop being such a dork.
3724480	eng	This is how we work.
3724484	eng	Twenty to one it'll work.
3724487	eng	I know Tom from work.
3724489	eng	I'll need someplace to work.
3724495	eng	Tom is dressed for work.
3724496	eng	I'm here looking for work.
3724499	eng	I've been following your work.
3724514	eng	We barely talked about work.
3724520	eng	I'm afraid to even ask.
3724527	eng	Tom drummed on the desk.
3724536	eng	Tom isn't a flight risk.
3724539	eng	I find your arguments illogical.
3724541	eng	The asking price is astronomical.
3724544	eng	Tom's condition is very critical.
3724546	eng	Tom won the sharpshooter medal.
3724552	eng	This one's the real deal.
3724553	eng	This is the real deal.
3724556	eng	I had a decent meal.
3724565	eng	Everything Tom does is illegal.
3724567	eng	You must be very special.
3724579	eng	Tom isn't exactly a liberal.
3724580	eng	Tom is a decorated general.
3724588	eng	None of us are immortal.
3724598	eng	That's the way I feel.
3724603	eng	Let me take the wheel.
3724605	eng	Tom peered down the tunnel.
3724609	eng	I've already posted your bail.
3724614	eng	I'll visit you in jail.
3724615	eng	Let it go to voicemail.
3724620	eng	Tom wasn't late after all.
3724622	eng	That's not good at all.
3724631	eng	I can make a call.
3724633	eng	You get one phone call.
3724634	eng	This isn't a social call.
3724635	eng	This is your wake-up call.
3724647	eng	It's really hard to tell.
3724651	eng	Tom remembered Mary quite well.
3724654	eng	That seemed to go well.
3724656	eng	Tom could dance rather well.
3724659	eng	Tom isn't looking very well.
3724666	eng	Tom ran on the treadmill.
3724668	eng	You'll need to hold still.
3724734	eng	That would be less painful.
3724748	eng	It sounds like a scam.
3724749	eng	That sounds like a scam.
3724751	eng	Take one for the team.
3724752	eng	You're part of our team.
3724757	eng	Their marriage is a sham.
3724758	eng	I don't need a cardiogram.
3724760	eng	I'm not what I seem.
3724762	eng	I have very low self-esteem.
3724763	eng	You must have dropped them.
3724764	eng	Someone must have planted them.
3724766	eng	That's why I like them.
3724769	eng	Tom was one of them.
3724781	eng	I've learned to trust them.
3724783	eng	You're better off without them.
3724784	eng	I felt threatened by them.
3724787	eng	Tom clearly has a problem.
3724789	eng	It wasn't a maintenance problem.
3724794	eng	There is an additional problem.
3724813	eng	Find Tom and kill him.
3724827	eng	Tom was the third victim.
3724835	eng	Tell me you understand, Tom.
3724841	eng	It wasn't your choice, Tom.
3724846	eng	You saved my marriage, Tom.
3724848	eng	Don't ride the brake, Tom.
3724851	eng	We're not bad people, Tom.
3724853	eng	You can't control me, Tom.
3724858	eng	This isn't your home, Tom.
3724859	eng	You're a strange one, Tom.
3724861	eng	I owe you one, Tom.
3724868	eng	Help me out here, Tom.
3724869	eng	You've lost me there, Tom.
3724876	eng	They'll promise you anything, Tom.
3724879	eng	You should be smiling, Tom.
3724880	eng	I'm ready and willing, Tom.
3724885	eng	You'll need your strength, Tom.
3724890	eng	Get with the program, Tom.
3724893	eng	Don't rub it in, Tom.
3724895	eng	We'll be together again, Tom.
3724898	eng	Get your clothes on, Tom.
3724899	eng	Don't run yourself down, Tom.
3724901	eng	Tell me you remember, Tom.
3724903	eng	Listen to your father, Tom.
3724904	eng	Don't sass your father, Tom.
3724909	eng	I admire your scruples, Tom.
3724911	eng	Stay on your toes, Tom.
3724920	eng	You have your orders, Tom.
3724928	eng	We meet at last, Tom.
3724934	eng	God be with you, Tom.
3724954	eng	You handled that badly, Tom.
3724958	eng	The girls all liked Tom.
3724979	eng	It's important we find Tom.
3724989	eng	That better not be Tom.
3725001	eng	That's why I like Tom.
3725003	eng	I didn't much like Tom.
3725007	eng	You sounded just like Tom.
3725008	eng	It sounds exactly like Tom.
3725014	eng	Let somebody else hire Tom.
3725036	eng	I've lost track of Tom.
3725049	eng	There was no avoiding Tom.
3725052	eng	Thank you for bringing Tom.
3725055	eng	There was no escaping Tom.
3725057	eng	I'll see what's keeping Tom.
3725059	eng	There was no stopping Tom.
3725099	eng	I'm moving in with Tom.
3725126	eng	You never know with Tom.
3725128	eng	Clearly, you're angry with Tom.
3725132	eng	I know who took Tom.
3725134	eng	You'd have to ask Tom.
3725141	eng	I'll let you tell Tom.
3725149	eng	You look worse than Tom.
3725155	eng	They're trying to restrain Tom.
3725156	eng	They must've relied on Tom.
3725173	eng	That'll depend entirely on Tom.
3725177	eng	This must've belonged to Tom.
3725197	eng	I wrote back to Tom.
3725205	eng	Mary looked beautiful to Tom.
3725216	eng	Try explaining that to Tom.
3725221	eng	It's very important to Tom.
3725224	eng	I'm recommending you to Tom.
3725248	eng	Nothing's good enough for Tom.
3725250	eng	That's good enough for Tom.
3725252	eng	I won't cook for Tom.
3725271	eng	That's what everybody calls Tom.
3725282	eng	You've got to respect Tom.
3725283	eng	They're here to protect Tom.
3725285	eng	We're about to meet Tom.
3725294	eng	Someone has to confront Tom.
3725311	eng	I wouldn't bet against Tom.
3725320	eng	We're done talking about Tom.
3725330	eng	I'm not upset about Tom.
3725340	eng	Do your best without Tom.
3725347	eng	I'll run it by Tom.
3725353	eng	Tom glanced round the room.
3725354	eng	Tom stepped inside the room.
3725358	eng	Tom was in the room.
3725371	eng	Tom glanced round the bedroom.
3725384	eng	We mean Tom no harm.
3725385	eng	It'll work like a charm.
3725386	eng	You're my good luck charm.
3725393	eng	Tom is at the podium.
3725394	eng	Tom did the bare minimum.
3725400	eng	Let's salvage what we can.
3725402	eng	I need to come clean.
3725407	eng	Tom is an excellent physician.
3725409	eng	It sounds like a plan.
3725410	eng	That sounds like a plan.
3725412	eng	That's part of the plan.
3725416	eng	We had a master plan.
3725421	eng	You need a good woman.
3725425	eng	Tom is a respectable businessman.
3725429	eng	We're at war with Japan.
3725433	eng	It was a little sudden.
3725442	eng	You're such a drama queen.
3725447	eng	Tom is no spring chicken.
3725448	eng	Tom reported his car stolen.
3725450	eng	They were all strong men.
3725457	eng	The door was kicked open.
3725458	eng	The window was wide open.
3725462	eng	The heavy door swung open.
3725465	eng	The rear gate was open.
3725481	eng	We can make this happen.
3725483	eng	I could make that happen.
3725492	eng	Tom leaned forward to listen.
3725493	eng	Tom leaned down to listen.
3725497	eng	That's usually a good sign.
3725499	eng	I'm impressed by your design.
3725504	eng	Tom has already checked in.
3725505	eng	Tom is all tucked in.
3725509	eng	That's where you come in.
3725512	eng	You should turn yourself in.
3725513	eng	Anyone could just walk in.
3725518	eng	Tom let me sleep in.
3725519	eng	I can get us in.
3725533	eng	That's how Tom got in.
3725535	eng	I can get you in.
3725561	eng	I had that dream again.
3725564	eng	Tom never turned up again.
3725567	eng	I read it over again.
3725568	eng	Tom opened his eyes again.
3725569	eng	Tom closed his eyes again.
3725570	eng	Tom shut his eyes again.
3725602	eng	You've got to be certain.
3725607	eng	We're stretched a little thin.
3725630	eng	So much is going on.
3725633	eng	The ceiling fan is on.
3725641	eng	Tom will need some persuasion.
3725644	eng	I'm waiting for your decision.
3725649	eng	I just had a vision.
3725650	eng	Tom doesn't require much supervision.
3725660	eng	You have a nasty concussion.
3725661	eng	I know you're on vacation.
3725662	eng	I've never seen such dedication.
3725663	eng	Tom isn't on any medication.
3725669	eng	This is only a simulation.
3725686	eng	Tom is losing his concentration.
3725698	eng	We sympathize with your situation.
3725702	eng	I can make a reservation.
3725720	eng	I have a skin condition.
3725721	eng	I know about your condition.
3725732	eng	That was never an option.
3725734	eng	Staying here isn't an option.
3725740	eng	Tom kindly answered the question.
3725747	eng	That's a mighty fine question.
3725748	eng	It was a legitimate question.
3725749	eng	That's a really provocative question.
3725751	eng	Your sanity isn't in question.
3725753	eng	Tom immediately answered Mary's question.
3725754	eng	I'm done with this question.
3725761	eng	We have an elegant solution.
3725765	eng	It was a great afternoon.
3725768	eng	Your time will come soon.
3725771	eng	Tom didn't come too soon.
3725775	eng	Tom looked for a weapon.
3725783	eng	Tom couldn't find his son.
3725785	eng	Get away from my son.
3725788	eng	Tell me there's a reason.
3725801	eng	You're going back to prison.
3725807	eng	You're a very privileged person.
3725808	eng	Tom isn't a stable person.
3725810	eng	You're a very perceptive person.
3725813	eng	Tom isn't a truthful person.
3725820	eng	It's Tom calling from Boston.
3725826	eng	Tom is stationed in Boston.
3725833	eng	I need you in Boston.
3725850	eng	Your safety isn't our concern.
3725854	eng	We need time to mourn.
3725858	eng	I want something in return.
3725860	eng	That's part of the fun.
3725864	eng	Let Tom have his fun.
3725866	eng	The guy had a gun.
3725868	eng	I don't wear a gun.
3725885	eng	I let my guard down.
3725901	eng	I'm closing this operation down.
3725902	eng	Tom put his glass down.
3725904	eng	That's how it went down.
3725905	eng	I'm putting my foot down.
3725911	eng	The circus is in town.
3725922	eng	It's not what we do.
3725996	eng	That's what I always do.
3725999	eng	Tom loves everything you do.
3726009	eng	Of course Tom will go.
3726012	eng	Just let the woman go.
3726017	eng	Look, I have to go.
3726055	eng	Remember, Tom, just say no.
3726056	eng	Tom didn't exactly say no.
3726058	eng	Tom is probably dead, too.
3726070	eng	That's what I want, too.
3726072	eng	Tom was a war hero.
3726074	eng	You're authorized to do so.
3726076	eng	I remember telling you so.
3726089	eng	Find somebody to talk to.
3726103	eng	You had quite a sleep.
3726106	eng	Tom was allowed to sleep.
3726125	eng	Tom will be denied membership.
3726127	eng	Don't give me any lip.
3726139	eng	Tom clearly wants to help.
3726144	eng	Tom was anxious for help.
3726145	eng	The country needs your help.
3726152	eng	That's why you're a cop.
3726156	eng	We have an unscheduled stop.
3726157	eng	I just wanted to stop.
3726158	eng	When's this going to stop?
3726159	eng	I'm not about to stop.
3726163	eng	Tom has been roughed up.
3726167	eng	Tom is all worked up.
3726168	eng	The crowd was worked up.
3726172	eng	Tom seemed pretty messed up.
3726179	eng	Tom really cracks me up.
3726180	eng	It never really came up.
3726182	eng	Tom just doesn't measure up.
3726186	eng	I was just finishing up.
3726188	eng	I didn't open anything up.
3726189	eng	That could've screwed everything up.
3726192	eng	I was just closing up.
3726198	eng	Tom was badly shook up.
3726200	eng	You guys should team up.
3726201	eng	Tom is pretty shaken up.
3726204	eng	Wow, you've really grown up.
3726206	eng	Tom packed his things up.
3726210	eng	We can't keep this up.
3726213	eng	Tom is pretty beat up.
3726214	eng	Tom made himself get up.
3726219	eng	Somebody must've picked it up.
3726223	eng	That about wraps it up.
3726230	eng	Maybe this'll cheer you up.
3726233	eng	That's where I grew up.
3726234	eng	It's time you grew up.
3726239	eng	Tom set down his cup.
3726251	eng	Tom leaped into the car.
3726275	eng	It gets better every year.
3726277	eng	Tom couldn't have gotten far.
3726284	eng	Tom was smoking a cigar.
3726304	eng	I know about your cancer.
3726305	eng	Tom isn't a charismatic leader.
3726306	eng	You're not exactly an outsider.
3726307	eng	Tom gently touched Mary's shoulder.
3726313	eng	I could've been a contender.
3726324	eng	Tom is completing your order.
3726333	eng	We're investigating a possible murder.
3726334	eng	Tom isn't guilty of murder.
3726342	eng	I could use a beer.
3726357	eng	Tom is withdrawing his offer.
3726359	eng	Tom wants them to suffer.
3726362	eng	Tom felt nothing except anger.
3726368	eng	These kids are in danger.
3726369	eng	My friends are in danger.
3726370	eng	Your lives are in danger.
3726443	eng	Tom is currently in danger.
3726446	eng	Tom was exposed to danger.
3726451	eng	Tom is a complete stranger.
3726452	eng	Tom wasn't a perfect stranger.
3726454	eng	Tom held up a finger.
3726456	eng	Tom held up one finger.
3726462	eng	They don't exist any longer.
3726474	eng	We're birds of a feather.
3726479	eng	Tom is my biological father.
3726484	eng	I'm named after your grandfather.
3726486	eng	You two were good together.
3726498	eng	Tom clasped his hands together.
3726502	eng	Tom and Mary sat together.
3726507	eng	This one's not working either.
3726510	eng	I can't see you either.
3726518	eng	They whispered to each other.
3726531	eng	Tom was a soldier's soldier.
3726534	eng	I should've said something earlier.
3726537	eng	Nothing could've made Tom happier.
3726541	eng	Tom is a successful banker.
3726542	eng	Tom is no investment banker.
3726558	eng	I'll see you at dinner.
3726565	eng	I don't need a partner.
3726566	eng	Tom is my dance partner.
3726568	eng	Tom glanced over the paper.
3726569	eng	Tom glanced at the paper.
3726572	eng	We need to dig deeper.
3726576	eng	Tom is a big-time loser.
3726577	eng	Tom is a complete loser.
3726578	eng	Tom is an excellent kisser.
3726588	eng	Tom arrived three days later.
3726591	eng	Tom stayed in the water.
3726598	eng	Tom always wanted a daughter.
3726603	eng	Tom is a published writer.
3726605	eng	Tom is a speech writer.
3726608	eng	The walls are white plaster.
3726610	eng	My life is a disaster.
3726611	eng	Everything goes in the dumpster.
3726615	eng	This is a grave matter.
3726620	eng	The less delay, the better.
3726625	eng	It made me feel better.
3726626	eng	Tom began to feel better.
3726633	eng	It will only get better.
3726641	eng	Tom is a potential babysitter.
3726642	eng	The room gradually got hotter.
3726643	eng	I don't need a computer.
3726649	eng	Tom is running a fever.
3726653	eng	You can't protect Tom forever.
3726655	eng	We can't live together forever.
3726657	eng	Tom has left us forever.
3726659	eng	Tom is the fastest driver.
3726661	eng	We have to pull over.
3726662	eng	We'll have a sleep over.
3726664	eng	Tom is glad it's over.
3726667	eng	Tell me this is over.
3726668	eng	I guess this is over.
3726678	eng	You already know the answer.
3726679	eng	Tom gave an evasive answer.
3726688	eng	Tom is a team player.
3726690	eng	You're a real team player.
3726691	eng	Tom hasn't got a prayer.
3726694	eng	My husband was a lawyer.
3726698	eng	Change is in the air.
3726700	eng	I just wanted some air.
3726703	eng	I have long blonde hair.
3726707	eng	Tom pulled up a chair.
3726711	eng	Tom slumped in his chair.
3726712	eng	Tom fidgeted in his chair.
3726714	eng	Tom collapsed into his chair.
3726716	eng	Your table is ready, sir.
3726732	eng	I'm not worth dying for.
3726739	eng	I regret my recent behavior.
3726740	eng	I don't need a counselor.
3726750	eng	Tom nodded toward the door.
3726751	eng	Tom came through the door.
3726752	eng	Tom emerged from the door.
3726757	eng	Tom appeared at the door.
3726758	eng	Tom ducked out the door.
3726759	eng	Tom stumbled out the door.
3726760	eng	Tom opened the truck door.
3726763	eng	I awoke on the floor.
3726766	eng	Tom was on the floor.
3726769	eng	Tom walked across the floor.
3726770	eng	I can feel Tom's terror.
3726774	eng	You deserve to be supervisor.
3726775	eng	I've already picked my successor.
3726784	eng	Tom is a parasailing instructor.
3726787	eng	We were returning a favor.
3726802	eng	Tom has the oddest ideas.
3726811	eng	That's not how it was.
3726812	eng	That's just how it was.
3726820	eng	I finally beat the odds.
3726823	eng	We both have urgent needs.
3726828	eng	Stop gossiping about my kids.
3726834	eng	Tom held out his hands.
3726874	eng	You have very steady hands.
3726891	eng	It'll just take three seconds.
3726901	eng	Tom saw many familiar faces.
3726903	eng	You should've seen their faces.
3726907	eng	These are very sophisticated devices.
3726908	eng	Tom couldn't take any chances.
3726912	eng	Tom likes what he sees.
3726923	eng	Someone's been playing with matches.
3726930	eng	Tom is in casual clothes.
3726934	eng	You have my deepest apologies.
3726938	eng	I need some new supplies.
3726942	eng	I know all the theories.
3726949	eng	There are too many difficulties.
3726951	eng	Tom slammed on his brakes.
3726953	eng	I know a million jokes.
3726965	eng	I fight my own battles.
3726989	eng	Let's see what it does.
3726995	eng	It's not like anybody cares.
3727014	eng	Tom neither reads nor writes.
3727015	eng	It'll just take three minutes.
3727021	eng	You're digging your own graves.
3727022	eng	We're here to save lives.
3727026	eng	Hold on for your lives.
3727030	eng	We wish to improve ourselves.
3727033	eng	Let's not lie to ourselves.
3727067	eng	You say the sweetest things.
3727071	eng	I know about your feelings.
3727074	eng	I've completely lost my bearings.
3727084	eng	I've been where Tom is.
3727102	eng	I couldn't have planned this.
3727103	eng	Tom hadn't really expected this.
3727118	eng	I'm not usually like this.
3727120	eng	Tom would've never done this.
3727123	eng	Get a load of this.
3727129	eng	You started all of this.
3727132	eng	Get a shot of this.
3727135	eng	Keep me out of this.
3727144	eng	You're the one doing this.
3727147	eng	I'm not comfortable discussing this.
3727165	eng	They're having fun with this.
3727176	eng	I'll never remember all this.
3727177	eng	Wow, look at all this.
3727183	eng	You know better than this.
3727192	eng	Tom hadn't counted on this.
3727194	eng	Let's be clear on this.
3727195	eng	Put your finger on this.
3727197	eng	I need you on this.
3727199	eng	We can all do this.
3727202	eng	You're going to do this.
3727207	eng	Look, I can't do this.
3727209	eng	You can't just do this.
3727219	eng	You forced me into this.
3727235	eng	I didn't look for this.
3727242	eng	You're really amazing at this.
3727244	eng	You've been warned about this.
3727254	eng	I'm so sorry about this.
3727263	eng	That's on a need-to-know basis.
3727265	eng	Tom walked in with snacks.
3727268	eng	I can barely use chopsticks.
3727269	eng	Tom peeled off his socks.
3727272	eng	You wouldn't last three weeks.
3727308	eng	When Tom drinks, everybody drinks.
3727309	eng	I think my job stinks.
3727313	eng	I know how this looks.
3727314	eng	Feed him to the sharks.
3727323	eng	You're as tough as nails.
3727325	eng	I won't go into details.
3727326	eng	Tom wouldn't pay his bills.
3727333	eng	That's the way it seems.
3727334	eng	Even beautiful people have problems.
3727336	eng	I'm having some legal problems.
3727350	eng	I have all your albums.
3727352	eng	They'll know what that means.
3727354	eng	I'm still studying the plans.
3727360	eng	It happens when it happens.
3727362	eng	I know all the signs.
3727368	eng	Don't make any rash decisions.
3727371	eng	I'm looking for reasonably-priced accommodations.
3727375	eng	I don't respond to accusations.
3727377	eng	We all earn our reputations.
3727401	eng	I have so many questions.
3727405	eng	We have more immediate concerns.
3727408	eng	Tom appeared on the steps.
3727409	eng	Tom dashed up the steps.
3727410	eng	Watch out for the steps.
3727414	eng	Tom licked his dry lips.
3727417	eng	Tell it to the cops.
3727418	eng	Tom looked through the bars.
3727419	eng	I've always been into cars.
3727423	eng	Tom couldn't stop the tears.
3727424	eng	Tom was almost in tears.
3727425	eng	Tom was close to tears.
3727427	eng	They were together three years.
3727442	eng	It may take many years.
3727452	eng	I've gone over the numbers.
3727454	eng	Tom is massaging Mary's shoulders.
3727457	eng	You should've followed Tom's orders.
3727459	eng	I already have my orders.
3727463	eng	It's not like we're strangers.
3727465	eng	I can't talk to strangers.
3727467	eng	Tom drummed with his fingers.
3727470	eng	Tom glanced at the others.
3727474	eng	I don't pick up hitchhikers.
3727484	eng	They are surrounded by admirers.
3727499	eng	Tom charged down the stairs.
3727502	eng	Tom never even came upstairs.
3727515	eng	The decision must be yours.
3727520	eng	I'm guessing this is yours.
3727527	eng	Tom set down his glass.
3727528	eng	Tom held out his glass.
3727534	eng	I've got nothing to confess.
3727538	eng	It's very rare and priceless.
3727542	eng	You guys are really clueless.
3727544	eng	It may be quite harmless.
3727546	eng	I'm sure you feel helpless.
3727563	eng	Tom is making real progress.
3727565	eng	I'm impressed by your progress.
3727567	eng	Tom is under considerable stress.
3727573	eng	That was my second guess.
3727575	eng	That was my first guess.
3727577	eng	It's never just a kiss.
3727586	eng	I don't care about boats.
3727588	eng	It doesn't change the facts.
3727604	eng	Hold on to your pants.
3727606	eng	You're not wearing any pants.
3727614	eng	I thought we had commitments.
3727616	eng	They were loving, caring parents.
3727618	eng	Tom dined with his parents.
3727620	eng	The rains came in torrents.
3727625	eng	I'm getting some beautiful shots.
3727628	eng	Tom seems out of sorts.
3727630	eng	I just ran some tests.
3727646	eng	Someone's been here before us.
3727647	eng	Somebody got there before us.
3727652	eng	They're here to save us.
3727655	eng	You're way ahead of us.
3727671	eng	Tom is toying with us.
3727675	eng	Come and fight with us.
3727687	eng	Tom is gaining on us.
3727688	eng	They're closing in on us.
3727702	eng	Tom made this mistake intentionally.
3727703	eng	Tom deliberately made this mistake.
3727747	eng	They left that for us.
3727749	eng	No one's getting past us.
3727761	eng	I think you're absolutely gorgeous.
3727764	eng	The room was fairly spacious.
3727776	eng	Tom will be getting anxious.
3727778	eng	Tom will be so jealous.
3727780	eng	Tom is delusional and dangerous.
3727782	eng	Tom seems to be dangerous.
3727786	eng	It's just way too dangerous.
3727790	eng	I think that's really generous.
3727804	eng	Tom delivered the horrible news.
3727817	eng	You're out of vacation days.
3727819	eng	It went on for days.
3727826	eng	Tom fumbled with his keys.
3727827	eng	They sent me three turkeys.
3727852	eng	That must've felt so great.
3727859	eng	Tom leaped from his seat.
3727862	eng	Tom hopped in the backseat.
3727865	eng	I never would've guessed that.
3727867	eng	I guess I deserved that.
3727868	eng	Somebody somewhere must've said that.
3727871	eng	You can work around that.
3727893	eng	Girls don't ordinarily like that.
3727898	eng	I can certainly appreciate that.
3727900	eng	I believe you believe that.
3727917	eng	I'm not just saying that.
3727920	eng	I'm not concerned with that.
3727923	eng	I can't compete with that.
3727925	eng	I can work with that.
3727926	eng	I was cool with that.
3727932	eng	I can prevent all that.
3727941	eng	It was more than that.
3727942	eng	Tom deserves more than that.
3727945	eng	Tom is smarter than that.
3727949	eng	Tom knows better than that.
3727952	eng	You know better than that.
3727968	eng	You should totally do that.
3727980	eng	You can help stop that.
3727982	eng	I needed to hear that.
3727986	eng	There's no getting over that.
3727988	eng	Perhaps I can answer that.
3727993	eng	You're too late for that.
3727996	eng	I hated Tom for that.
3728001	eng	You can't look at that.
3728010	eng	I feel horrible about that.
3728016	eng	We're very curious about that.
3728035	eng	We're forever in your debt.
3728038	eng	Let's stay in close contact.
3728044	eng	You already have my respect.
3728045	eng	I've failed in every respect.
3728055	eng	Tom scrambled to his feet.
3728056	eng	Tom leaped to his feet.
3728057	eng	Tom got to his feet.
3728066	eng	I only wanted to forget.
3728072	eng	The house seemed strangely quiet.
3728073	eng	The house is very quiet.
3728080	eng	Tom searched in his pocket.
3728083	eng	Tom vomited into the bucket.
3728102	eng	We've received no explanation yet.
3728103	eng	It hasn't come up yet.
3728106	eng	I may do it yet.
3728108	eng	Don't tell Tom just yet.
3728111	eng	I haven't dismissed you yet.
3728113	eng	There's hope for you yet.
3728118	eng	You've got one minute left.
3728119	eng	You have one move left.
3728120	eng	There's only one torpedo left.
3728124	eng	I'll take the first shift.
3728127	eng	I must be getting soft.
3728128	eng	Let's get one thing straight.
3728129	eng	Let me get something straight.
3728139	eng	Tom switched off the light.
3728141	eng	Tom cried out with delight.
3728192	eng	I had an awful night.
3728213	eng	Tom is flying in tonight.
3728218	eng	We're having TV dinners tonight.
3728223	eng	That's Tom on the right.
3728238	eng	You gave me a fright.
3728240	eng	Tom was out of sight.
3728244	eng	Tom is nowhere in sight.
3728245	eng	The end is in sight.
3728251	eng	My testimony can't be bought.
3728253	eng	It's just as I thought.
3728258	eng	Tom is lost in thought.
3728262	eng	I think you liked it.
3728263	eng	Someone else must've opened it.
3728264	eng	I might have mentioned it.
3728267	eng	You can't have wanted it.
3728274	eng	Tom could hardly stand it.
3728277	eng	I'm going to find it.
3728281	eng	That's how I found it.
3728298	eng	Trust me, you'll like it.
3728309	eng	You can't just have it.
3728310	eng	I'm beginning to believe it.
3728313	eng	I'm going to prove it.
3728317	eng	Tom was sure of it.
3728327	eng	That's only part of it.
3728329	eng	That's the last of it.
3728330	eng	Make the most of it.
3728334	eng	Leave us out of it.
3728340	eng	Tom couldn't resist touching it.
3728347	eng	This is pretty much it.
3728348	eng	I'll talk you through it.
3728350	eng	Tom was OK with it.
3728351	eng	Tom seems OK with it.
3728353	eng	I can live with it.
3728361	eng	They're having fun with it.
3728366	eng	I'm vaguely familiar with it.
3728368	eng	They're getting away with it.
3728391	eng	That's how we do it.
3728392	eng	That's when I'll do it.
3728393	eng	I let Tom do it.
3728401	eng	OK, let's just do it.
3728402	eng	That should about do it.
3728405	eng	I couldn't swear to it.
3728407	eng	Tom beat you to it.
3728410	eng	Put your backs into it.
3728416	eng	I'm saying get over it.
3728419	eng	There's no need for it.
3728421	eng	We'll wait here for it.
3728423	eng	I almost fell for it.
3728426	eng	We'll pay you for it.
3728429	eng	That's how Tom does it.
3728432	eng	You were bad at it.
3728433	eng	I was good at it.
3728434	eng	They're still going at it.
3728435	eng	You're going to eat it.
3728440	eng	We should never forget it.
3728446	eng	I'm very much against it.
3728452	eng	I'm very excited about it.
3728470	eng	I guess that's about it.
3728474	eng	I'll tell you about it.
3728478	eng	I can live without it.
3728480	eng	I knew you'd blow it.
3728486	eng	That was worth the wait.
3728493	eng	I'm a creature of habit.
3728495	eng	We're all creatures of habit.
3728496	eng	Tom is asking for credit.
3728499	eng	I don't care about profit.
3728501	eng	I'm doing the speed limit.
3728513	eng	The rest was my fault.
3728516	eng	This is a good result.
3728521	eng	I thought you were brilliant.
3728527	eng	I think birthdays are important.
3728539	eng	The ruins are truly magnificent.
3728541	eng	They must know I'm innocent.
3728548	eng	I haven't exactly been prudent.
3728556	eng	Tom was a mental patient.
3728558	eng	Tom felt himself growing impatient.
3728564	eng	I could never be violent.
3728578	eng	Tom's eyes twinkle with amusement.
3728581	eng	I've always trusted your judgment.
3728583	eng	Tom glanced around in astonishment.
3728607	eng	We've received our first assignment.
3728610	eng	They chatted for a moment.
3728616	eng	It was an awkward moment.
3728623	eng	That was a beautiful moment.
3728634	eng	Tom couldn't hide his disappointment.
3728636	eng	I wasn't in your apartment.
3728641	eng	You make an interesting argument.
3728644	eng	Tom is a worthy opponent.
3728652	eng	That's what makes us different.
3728654	eng	It doesn't feel any different.
3728658	eng	It's a black tie event.
3728660	eng	You make a good point.
3728664	eng	Everybody has a breaking point.
3728665	eng	Tom was robbed at gunpoint.
3728675	eng	You think you're so hot.
3728677	eng	I gave it a shot.
3728678	eng	You'll get only one shot.
3728683	eng	That was a lucky shot.
3728687	eng	I move around a lot.
3728688	eng	That sounds like a lot.
3728691	eng	It could matter a lot.
3728692	eng	I don't expect a lot.
3728699	eng	I can't imagine why not.
3728712	eng	I'm not usually this inept.
3728715	eng	I'm nursing a broken heart.
3728721	eng	I think that's really smart.
3728722	eng	I think you're plenty smart.
3728725	eng	You already did your part.
3728728	eng	That was the worst part.
3728733	eng	Tom woke with a start.
3728755	eng	Tom took out his passport.
3728757	eng	A little practice couldn't hurt.
3728760	eng	We have to move fast.
3728762	eng	Tom began to talk fast.
3728768	eng	I invited them to breakfast.
3728771	eng	You should make a toast.
3728774	eng	Tom is still the best.
3728780	eng	Get it off your chest.
3728785	eng	Tom, give it a rest.
3728786	eng	You need time to rest.
3728787	eng	Tom listened with deep interest.
3728788	eng	We're placing you under arrest.
3728789	eng	I'm placing you under arrest.
3728796	eng	I don't need a psychologist.
3728800	eng	Tom is determined to resist.
3728808	eng	I know when I've lost.
3728811	eng	Get back to your post.
3728823	eng	Tom is all weirded out.
3728829	eng	The militia were called out.
3728831	eng	Tom is pretty wiped out.
3728833	eng	They were all tired out.
3728834	eng	I need to find out.
3728836	eng	We're going to find out.
3728842	eng	Tom is creeping me out.
3728844	eng	You're not buying me out.
3728857	eng	Tom says you're moving out.
3728859	eng	You'd just better watch out.
3728862	eng	Tom's story didn't check out.
3728869	eng	I planned it all out.
3728873	eng	Tom's girlfriend threw him out.
3728876	eng	You're time just ran out.
3728877	eng	Tom is clearly worn out.
3728884	eng	Tom must've sold us out.
3728885	eng	Thanks for pointing that out.
3728890	eng	Tom was checking you out.
3728896	eng	That's what I'm here about.
3728905	eng	There's nothing to think about.
3728912	eng	I think we'll stay put.
3728916	eng	Everyone knows what'll happen next.
3728920	eng	That's why I need you.
3728921	eng	That's why we need you.
3728926	eng	That's why I hired you.
3728927	eng	That's why I rescued you.
3728928	eng	That's why I loved you.
3728930	eng	That's why I followed you.
3728931	eng	I knew I recognized you.
3728933	eng	I came to find you.
3728938	eng	Maybe this will convince you.
3728942	eng	I needed to see you.
3728945	eng	It's wonderful to see you.
3728949	eng	I could've been like you.
3728950	eng	I need men like you.
3728958	eng	I want to please you.
3728966	eng	I choose to believe you.
3728972	eng	Tom was ashamed of you.
3728977	eng	That's really noble of you.
3728983	eng	That's very mature of you.
3728985	eng	That's very civil of you.
3728991	eng	That's very elitist of you.
3728992	eng	That's enough out of you.
3728996	eng	Thank you for being you.
3728999	eng	That's why I'm asking you.
3729002	eng	Tom has been misinforming you.
3729004	eng	I won't even touch you.
3729053	eng	Tom was toying with you.
3729054	eng	Tom is toying with you.
3729056	eng	That's what's wrong with you.
3729107	eng	The drinks are on you.
3729109	eng	I checked up on you.
3729128	eng	It'll come back to you.
3729134	eng	I'm very drawn to you.
3729146	eng	Maybe I'll run into you.
3729147	eng	I was totally into you.
3729148	eng	It's going to help you.
3729169	eng	Tom sacrificed everything for you.
3729173	eng	They'll be rooting for you.
3729184	eng	I grabbed this for you.
3729212	eng	They're out to get you.
3729213	eng	Sometimes I don't get you.
3729215	eng	I never should've left you.
3729217	eng	That's why Tom hit you.
3729220	eng	That's why we want you.
3729222	eng	I never would've shot you.
3729236	eng	It's going to cost you.
3729237	eng	That's why I trust you.
3729243	eng	I'm not writing about you.
3729244	eng	I've read all about you.
3729245	eng	Not everything is about you.
3729246	eng	Tom, this isn't about you.
3729251	eng	We're better off without you.
3729261	eng	I'm still intimidated by you.
3729264	eng	You nearly broke my jaw.
3729266	eng	That's not what I saw.
3729268	eng	Tom liked what he saw.
3729275	eng	Tom crossed to the window.
3729278	eng	I'll make myself useful somehow.
3729279	eng	You're missing the late show.
3729281	eng	You were a no show.
3729283	eng	I'm surprised Tom didn't show.
3729287	eng	Tom is an eccentric fellow.
3729295	eng	You can get dressed now.
3729300	eng	I'm done fooling around now.
3729302	eng	It's got to be now.
3729303	eng	Tom is at peace now.
3729305	eng	We're totally different people now.
3729306	eng	You'll come with me now.
3729308	eng	My computer works fine now.
3729310	eng	I get the picture now.
3729317	eng	That's how I feel now.
3729345	eng	I'm opening my presents now.
3729347	eng	I can see that now.
3729379	eng	We're in for it now.
3729380	eng	We're serious about it now.
3729381	eng	I'm practically an adult now.
3729384	eng	I'm practically an expert now.
3729385	eng	I'm very unhappy just now.
3729388	eng	It's all behind you now.
3729392	eng	I could kill you now.
3729393	eng	I'm coming to you now.
3729417	eng	I guess we'll never know.
3729425	eng	You're wiser than you know.
3729439	eng	We're in the same fix.
3729441	eng	You haven't aged a day.
3729443	eng	Somebody's having a good day.
3729546	eng	This is your special day.
3729553	eng	We had a slow day.
3729554	eng	It's been a slow day.
3729572	eng	You can't be around today.
3729584	eng	We're expecting lousy weather today.
3729601	eng	The organ started to play.
3729607	eng	That's the price you pay.
3729612	eng	That's what you should say.
3729630	eng	You know what they say.
3729635	eng	Tom didn't care to stay.
3729642	eng	You'd feel the same way.
3729645	eng	I pay my own way.
3729646	eng	I don't mind either way.
3729650	eng	Tom was in Mary's way.
3729657	eng	Pizza is on its way.
3729662	eng	You'll never escape that way.
3729663	eng	It doesn't look that way.
3729666	eng	You've always been that way.
3729668	eng	It certainly looks that way.
3729685	eng	Tom blushed and turned away.
3729691	eng	You've already given yourself away.
3729695	eng	You take my breath away.
3729696	eng	Just let me walk away.
3729711	eng	You should be put away.
3729712	eng	This will blow you away.
3729714	eng	Tom just can't stay away.
3729716	eng	Tom made a clean getaway.
3729718	eng	They met each other halfway.
3729719	eng	Tom didn't belong here anyway.
3729727	eng	Tom is afraid of intimacy.
3729733	eng	Tom had a family emergency.
3729741	eng	You have my attention already.
3729742	eng	I'm practically an adult already.
3729752	eng	I've never actually tortured anybody.
3729765	eng	I've been watching you study.
3729775	eng	We can make some money.
3729786	eng	I'm not asking for money.
3729794	eng	Not everything is about money.
3729797	eng	You never have any money.
3729798	eng	Tom is an excellent attorney.
3729801	eng	Tom is still pretty groggy.
3729803	eng	It'll help you save energy.
3729805	eng	Tom doesn't seem particularly trustworthy.
3729811	eng	I couldn't tell you why.
3729814	eng	I couldn't get that lucky.
3729818	eng	Tom smiled and laughed uncomfortably.
3729826	eng	Tom left the room hurriedly.
3729839	eng	Tom looked at them closely.
3729840	eng	Tom looked at Mary closely.
3729845	eng	It's you who've acted inappropriately.
3729851	eng	Tom changed his attitude completely.
3729856	eng	Tom looked at Mary apprehensively.
3729862	eng	Tom looked at Mary inquiringly.
3729866	eng	It's going to get ugly.
3729881	eng	Tom clenched his fists angrily.
3729882	eng	Tom looked at Mary uneasily.
3729885	eng	Tom turned the page quickly.
3729889	eng	Tom closed his eyes quickly.
3729890	eng	Tom looked at Mary quickly.
3729892	eng	Tom stared at Mary blankly.
3729896	eng	Don't take it so personally.
3729900	eng	The sail won't open fully.
3729907	eng	Tom performed his duties faithfully.
3729909	eng	The two brothers embraced warmly.
3729913	eng	Tom woke up quite suddenly.
3729914	eng	Tom could see it plainly.
3729916	eng	Tom didn't attempt to reply.
3729917	eng	Tom looked at Mary sharply.
3729928	eng	We've got to talk seriously.
3729931	eng	Tom glanced at Mary curiously.
3729932	eng	Tom looked at Mary curiously.
3729934	eng	You do like living dangerously.
3729935	eng	Tom looked at Mary contemptuously.
3729937	eng	Tom cleared his throat nervously.
3729985	eng	I don't hate Tom exactly.
3729992	eng	Tom went upstairs very quietly.
3730002	eng	Tom lowered his voice slightly.
3730003	eng	Tom and Mary hugged tightly.
3730004	eng	Tom clenched his hands tightly.
3730015	eng	I think Tom feels differently.
3730016	eng	Tom looked at Mary intently.
3730020	eng	It should be ready shortly.
3730024	eng	Tom sipped his wine slowly.
3730037	eng	Tom is joining our company.
3730039	eng	It was worth every penny.
3730040	eng	Normally this would be funny.
3730044	eng	Tom was writhing in agony.
3730049	eng	Tom couldn't contain his joy.
3730050	eng	It's time for your therapy.
3730054	eng	I thought it was creepy.
3730057	eng	Tom was suddenly very happy.
3730058	eng	Maybe Tom is getting sloppy.
3730066	eng	Tom followed closely behind Mary.
3730075	eng	Tom threatened to leave Mary.
3730077	eng	Tom frequently thought of Mary.
3730084	eng	Tom made peace with Mary.
3730090	eng	Tom is conferring with Mary.
3730096	eng	Tom planned to kill Mary.
3730098	eng	Tom looked away from Mary.
3730108	eng	Tom wasn't listening to Mary.
3730110	eng	Tom looked familiar to Mary.
3730112	eng	Tom crept closer to Mary.
3730115	eng	Tom handed it to Mary.
3730130	eng	Tom has feelings for Mary.
3730131	eng	Tom's last girlfriend was Mary.
3730136	eng	Tom looked questioningly at Mary.
3730139	eng	Tom looked up at Mary.
3730140	eng	Tom looked sideways at Mary.
3730141	eng	Tom looked anxiously at Mary.
3730145	eng	Tom was right about Mary.
3730146	eng	Tom was distracted by Mary.
3730161	eng	Tom felt himself getting hungry.
3730162	eng	Tom was suddenly very hungry.
3730168	eng	Hey, it's just a story.
3730171	eng	I'm not buying your story.
3730172	eng	Tom told us his story.
3730174	eng	I told Tom my story.
3730177	eng	Tom will be so sorry.
3730181	eng	There wasn't any special hurry.
3730190	eng	You're making this too easy.
3730191	eng	Life could be so easy.
3730193	eng	You're not making this easy.
3730203	eng	We're concerned for your safety.
3730211	eng	I heard Tom hates publicity.
3730216	eng	Tom hadn't considered that possibility.
3730222	eng	You had plenty of opportunity.
3730223	eng	I'm giving you an opportunity.
3730226	eng	You may have that opportunity.
3730227	eng	I regret losing that opportunity.
3730234	eng	I don't feel that guilty.
3730236	eng	I'll see you in twenty.
3730240	eng	The street was very empty.
3730243	eng	I'm at an office party.
3730249	eng	It makes me feel dirty.
3730267	eng	You've got the wrong guy.
3730273	eng	Tom was green with envy.
3730277	eng	Please tell me it's crazy.
3730280	eng	What's happening here at 2:30?
3730281	eng	Where were you on 9/11?
3730291	eng	It scared me, too, OK?
3730307	eng	How come you're not dead?
3730309	eng	What would we do instead?
3730311	eng	How many have you had?
3730312	eng	Did that make Tom mad?
3730313	eng	Did that make you mad?
3730316	eng	Is it time you need?
3730317	eng	Is it money you need?
3730319	eng	Is that why they died?
3730327	eng	How many have you killed?
3730328	eng	How could it have happened?
3730330	eng	Can you determine what happened?
3730350	eng	Where was Tom being held?
3730352	eng	Why should we all stand?
3730357	eng	Have I lost my mind?
3730365	eng	Can anyone report anything good?
3730367	eng	Why are you being weird?
3730370	eng	Can I say it aloud?
3730371	eng	How old could Tom be?

3730557	eng	What's the job this time?
3730562	eng	How about sleeping at home?
3730566	eng	Do you have the vaccine?
3730571	eng	Could you leave me one?
3730587	eng	Isn't that why we're here?

3730734	eng	Who said anything about sleeping?
3730738	eng	How much did you bring?
3730739	eng	How much are they offering?
3730755	eng	Should we have some lunch?

3731152	eng	How could you resist Tom?
3731175	eng	Is that still my room?
3731183	eng	Where's all this coming from?
3731190	eng	What could it all mean?
3731191	eng	So what does it mean?
3731194	eng	Are you getting enough oxygen?
3731205	eng	Who knows what could happen?
3731211	eng	When's this supposed to happen?
3731212	eng	How's it going to happen?
3731217	eng	Could you fill me in?
3731224	eng	What are the rules again?
3731229	eng	Where do we even begin?
3731249	eng	Can I make one observation?
3731251	eng	What would get their attention?
3731260	eng	Do you carry a weapon?
3731261	eng	Do I need a reason?
3731275	eng	What was I to do?
3731280	eng	What is it you do?
3731281	eng	Did you shoot this video?
3731285	eng	How did Tom's hearing go?
3731286	eng	How far would Tom go?
3731348	eng	God can be found everywhere.
3731351	eng	That's not an issue anymore.
3731354	eng	That never was an issue.
3731359	eng	Better a little than nothing.
3731363	eng	A marathon is pretty exhausting.
3731372	eng	Tom worked around the clock.
3731375	eng	Fear is essential for survival.
3731382	eng	Never trust a naked woman.
3731395	eng	Those are old wives' tales.
3731400	eng	I'm familiar with such things.
3731408	eng	Spare me the grisly details.
3731418	eng	Tom got away with it.
3731422	eng	My patience is running out.
3731430	eng	Don't take it so literally.
3731431	eng	They greeted each other warmly.
3731436	eng	Do you mean to go?
3731439	eng	How far can you go?
3731440	eng	Where did the money go?
3731443	eng	Do you feel it, too?
3731444	eng	What am I agreeing to?
3731450	eng	Who said you could sleep?
3731456	eng	What are you doing up?
3731459	eng	Did you give him up?
3731460	eng	What did you turn up?
3731463	eng	Would you just shut up?
3731464	eng	Did you see that car?
3731465	eng	Did you steal that car?
3731473	eng	Are you the group leader?
3731480	eng	How many were there altogether?
3731486	eng	Are you the medical examiner?
3731487	eng	Did you fix the scanner?
3731506	eng	Is that your own hair?
3731510	eng	What were they imprisoned for?
3731514	eng	Who are you here for?
3731520	eng	Could you describe Tom's demeanor?
3731524	eng	What are you going as?
3731529	eng	How did you feel afterwards?
3731534	eng	How much are the lilies?
3731544	eng	Did you slash Tom's tires?
3731574	eng	Do you approve of this?
3731576	eng	What's the point of this?
3731595	eng	How do you stop this?
3731601	eng	Did you pack any snacks?
3731605	eng	Do you not like girls?
3731615	eng	Does Tom wear shoes indoors?
3731621	eng	Do I have to undress?
3731622	eng	Has Tom made any progress?
3731623	eng	Do you take American Express?
3731626	eng	Who else do you miss?
3731635	eng	Where are they sending us?
3731642	eng	What does that tell us?
3731646	eng	How does it help us?
3731656	eng	Do you consider them dangerous?
3731657	eng	Didn't you read the prospectus?
3731662	eng	What are you smiling at?
3731665	eng	How did they manage that?
3731675	eng	How can we prove that?
3731683	eng	Do you really think that?
3731684	eng	Did anyone else feel that?
3731685	eng	Does anybody else feel that?
3731686	eng	Did you hear all that?
3731687	eng	What's the fun in that?
3731689	eng	How about I do that?
3731691	eng	How did we do that?
3731698	eng	Does anyone else hear that?
3731705	eng	Can't you just accept that?
3731709	eng	How do we know that?
3731710	eng	How could Tom know that?
3731711	eng	How does Tom know that?
3731712	eng	How could you say that?
3731719	eng	Would you care to bet?
3731722	eng	How bad can this get?
3731723	eng	How much will you get?
3731726	eng	Does Tom have a secret?
3731728	eng	Tom, are you all set?
3731783	eng	Have you got it yet?
3731784	eng	How much is there left?
3731791	eng	How do I look tonight?
3731792	eng	Can you watch Tom tonight?
3731796	eng	You're messing with me, right?
3731802	eng	You've got your permit, right?
3731806	eng	Do I have it right?
3731807	eng	Can you hold that thought?
3731818	eng	How did Tom like it?
3731821	eng	Are you sure of it?
3731824	eng	How are you taking it?
3731831	eng	Why must we do it?
3731833	eng	How do parents do it?
3731837	eng	Can we just drop it?
3731839	eng	Should we run for it?
3731843	eng	Life isn't fair, is it?
3731847	eng	That sounds credible, doesn't it?
3731863	eng	How could you allow it?
3731869	eng	Is it money you want?
3731875	eng	Might I have a moment?
3731877	eng	Do you like the apartment?
3731880	eng	Is this the art department?
3731890	eng	Did you see the transcript?
3731892	eng	How soon can you start?
3731894	eng	How much are we short?
3731896	eng	Can I help with breakfast?
3731899	eng	Isn't that a little dishonest?
3731901	eng	Who made the actual arrest?
3731905	eng	What am I up against?
3731907	eng	What can you make out?
3731916	eng	When did this come about?
3731922	eng	Who do we see next?
3731923	eng	Why does Tom need you?
3731926	eng	Did the phone wake you?
3731928	eng	How does that strike you?
3731935	eng	So how mad are you?
3731939	eng	How can I refuse you?
3731940	eng	How could Tom hate you?
3731941	eng	Why do I believe you?
3731948	eng	How do I thank you?
3731951	eng	What do I call you?
3731952	eng	What can I tell you?
3731955	eng	Get some help, will you?
3731956	eng	Why should we harm you?
3731958	eng	You never stop, do you?
3731982	eng	When is good for you?
3731983	eng	Was that weird for you?
3731985	eng	How's that going for you?
3731986	eng	Isn't that enough for you?
3731988	eng	Does that work for you?
3732007	eng	So what else is new?
3732010	eng	Did you see the show?
3732014	eng	Why come to me now?
3732023	eng	Am I under investigation now?
3732035	eng	Does Tom shower every day?
3732039	eng	How are we feeling today?
3732044	eng	Do you want to pray?
3732046	eng	Does that mean you'll stay?
3732065	eng	Don't you just hate technology?
3732067	eng	Can I tell Tom why?
3732068	eng	What if I'm not lucky?
3732072	eng	Do you have other family?
3732073	eng	Does Tom have any family?
3732078	eng	Do you enjoy living dangerously?
3732079	eng	What is your type exactly?
3732093	eng	Did it make you angry?
3732097	eng	Why not let Tom try?
3732098	eng	Would you care to try?
3732103	eng	Am I cleared for duty?
3732149	eng	What a bunch of idiots!
3732151	eng	What a cute little boy!
3732152	eng	The performance began at 8:00.
3732158	eng	See you guys at 2:30.
3732171	eng	They're going to be OK.
3732180	eng	I'd like a piña colada.
3732181	eng	That was the basic idea.
3732185	eng	OK, I get the idea.
3732187	eng	That's a very interesting idea.
3732188	eng	Well, I like that idea.
3732189	eng	I haven't the slightest idea.
3732199	eng	This might be Tom's umbrella.
3732214	eng	Tom can finish the job.
3732228	eng	This is a private club.
3732231	eng	This could start a panic.
3732238	eng	Tom seemed to be frantic.
3732242	eng	Tom might do something bad.
3732243	eng	Tom didn't do anything bad.
3732247	eng	It wasn't all that bad.
3732262	eng	Everybody will be very glad.
3732264	eng	Tom stumbled down the road.
3732271	eng	Tom was lying in bed.
3732272	eng	Tom went back to bed.
3732273	eng	They all went to bed.
3732282	eng	More time will be needed.
3732285	eng	I can do it blindfolded.
3732289	eng	I hope you're not offended.
3732290	eng	Tom's prison sentence was suspended.
3732291	eng	Some of them were wounded.
3732303	eng	We were all very touched.
3732304	eng	Some of the girls laughed.
3732307	eng	I think you've been brainwashed.
3732310	eng	Tom ought to be punished.
3732330	eng	Tom knew Mary was married.
3732332	eng	Tom and Mary weren't married.
3732345	eng	I've done what you've asked.
3732356	eng	That was why Tom screamed.
3732357	eng	One of the youngsters screamed.
3732358	eng	Perhaps Tom was feeling ashamed.
3732359	eng	I think you've been misinformed.
3732368	eng	That's not all that happened.
3732372	eng	Tell me about what happened.
3732383	eng	Tom seemed to be frightened.
3732388	eng	Tom felt lonely and abandoned.
3732390	eng	I got a little sunburned.
3732393	eng	The leaves have turned red.
3732394	eng	Tom got a little red.
3732395	eng	Tom knew that Mary cared.
3732396	eng	Tom wasn't a bit scared.
3732397	eng	Tom isn't a bit scared.
3732408	eng	Everyone except Tom looked tired.
3732410	eng	Tom looked hot and tired.
3732411	eng	I thought you'd be tired.
3732413	eng	I feel a little tired.
3732417	eng	I'm beginning to get tired.
3732418	eng	I'm feeling a bit tired.
3732419	eng	Tom wasn't a bit tired.
3732420	eng	I really am very tired.
3732421	eng	Tom doesn't seem very tired.
3732430	eng	Tom was a little surprised.
3732432	eng	I bet Tom was surprised.
3732433	eng	Those doors should be closed.
3732437	eng	The door is now closed.
3732440	eng	Everybody was very well dressed.
3732451	eng	I'm getting a bit confused.
3732460	eng	The situation is very complicated.
3732462	eng	I think you've been cheated.
3732464	eng	I think you've been infected.
3732468	eng	It's just what I expected.
3732470	eng	That was to be expected.
3732472	eng	The environment must be protected.
3732473	eng	Tom sat down and waited.
3732476	eng	This isn't what I wanted.
3732479	eng	That's exactly what I wanted.
3732481	eng	Tom wants to be wanted.
3732482	eng	Tom had everything he wanted.
3732486	eng	Tom knew what Mary wanted.
3732487	eng	Tom seems a little disoriented.
3732494	eng	Tom was obviously very disappointed.
3732495	eng	The votes are being counted.
3732500	eng	Your time won't be wasted.
3732510	eng	I've done what you've requested.
3732518	eng	Tom asked where Mary lived.
3732521	eng	We were all very moved.
3732530	eng	I'm not at all afraid.
3732531	eng	I was a bit afraid.
3732532	eng	Don't forget what I said.
3732534	eng	Something had to be said.
3732536	eng	That was all Tom said.
3732545	eng	Tom believed what Mary said.
3732586	eng	It isn't a bit cold.
3732596	eng	Honshu is Japan's largest island.
3732599	eng	Tom pretended not to understand.
3732600	eng	I think Tom didn't understand.
3732604	eng	This is my best friend.
3732605	eng	I already have a girlfriend.
3732614	eng	Let's go hiking next weekend.
3732625	eng	Tom has changed his mind.
3732628	eng	I've just changed my mind.
3732630	eng	I don't like standing around.
3732632	eng	Tom stopped to look around.
3732637	eng	I should've bought more food.
3732640	eng	Thank you for buying food.
3732649	eng	What I saw looked good.
3732651	eng	This had better be good.
3732653	eng	Hunger makes anything taste good.
3732659	eng	This cake isn't that good.
3732661	eng	They say it's very good.
3732662	eng	Tom's French is very good.
3732669	eng	That was all we heard.
3732671	eng	This shouldn't be too hard.
3732685	eng	Come back here, you coward.
3732687	eng	This is a little weird.
3732690	eng	Tom couldn't remember his password.
3732700	eng	This is a public place.
3732708	eng	Tom went into Mary's office.
3732717	eng	Stop trying to be nice.
3732722	eng	This place is really nice.
3732723	eng	Tom is really awfully nice.
3732726	eng	There was no other choice.
3732727	eng	Hunger is the best spice.
3732732	eng	I really appreciate your advice.
3732734	eng	I've only seen Tom twice.
3732739	eng	Thank you for your guidance.
3732746	eng	Tom is a real nuisance.
3732748	eng	I should've paid in advance.
3732754	eng	I crawled under the fence.
3732755	eng	I climbed over the fence.
3732757	eng	I have a clear conscience.
3732761	eng	That made all the difference.
3732762	eng	Tom won't know the difference.
3732763	eng	It doesn't make much difference.
3732764	eng	Tom was hard to convince.
3732765	eng	I've only seen Tom once.
3732773	eng	There was nowhere to hide.
3732774	eng	Everyone has something to hide.
3732778	eng	The place was empty inside.
3732781	eng	Let's see what's happening outside.
3732788	eng	Tom helped himself to coffee.
3732793	eng	I've got to be free.
3732803	eng	I still think we're safe.
3732805	eng	I'll put it somewhere safe.
3732811	eng	I got out my knife.
3732812	eng	Tom usually carries a pocketknife.
3732813	eng	Tom doesn't have a wife.
3732840	eng	They left me in charge.
3732850	eng	Help me with my tie.
3732851	eng	Tom is watching a movie.
3732856	eng	Tom wouldn't like this movie.
3732861	eng	Cheesecake is my favorite cake.
3732865	eng	These are hard to make.
3732868	eng	There must be a mistake.
3732869	eng	Perhaps I made a mistake.
3732872	eng	I must've made a mistake.
3732873	eng	Tom must've made a mistake.
3732874	eng	You must've made a mistake.
3732878	eng	That's a very common mistake.
3732879	eng	Tom apologized for his mistake.
3732881	eng	Maybe I'll buy a bike.
3732886	eng	My car isn't for sale.
3732888	eng	Tom ought to be reliable.
3732890	eng	The kitchen chairs aren't stackable.
3732892	eng	Tom looks a little miserable.
3732899	eng	Please come to the table.
3732916	eng	Run as fast as possible.
3732917	eng	Come as early as possible.
3732920	eng	That would be physically impossible.
3732935	eng	This might take a while.
3732936	eng	This may take a while.
3732958	eng	This really isn't that simple.
3732961	eng	Tom knows many famous people.
3732963	eng	I gave Tom an apple.
3732965	eng	Tom has changed very little.
3732967	eng	Tom looked at the schedule.
3732968	eng	This is an old rule.
3732971	eng	I'm glad you reminded me.
3732982	eng	People tend to like me.
3732994	eng	Tom would never forgive me.
3732995	eng	Tom never did love me.
3732997	eng	They're not afraid of me.
3733001	eng	Tom will come with me.
3733003	eng	You'll be here with me.
3733004	eng	There's something wrong with me.
3733007	eng	Tom did stay with me.
3733011	eng	You've been stealing from me.
3733014	eng	You've been luckier than me.
3733017	eng	Tom doesn't count on me.
3733020	eng	It tasted good to me.
3733021	eng	That seems weird to me.
3733023	eng	That sounds strange to me.
3733024	eng	Tom never wrote to me.
3733026	eng	They didn't speak to me.
3733031	eng	Tom has written to me.
3733034	eng	Tom explained it to me.
3733040	eng	This is new to me.
3733042	eng	That sounds funny to me.
3733046	eng	Tom seemed to remember me.
3733048	eng	That's the place for me.
3733062	eng	Perhaps you can beat me.
3733070	eng	Please don't leave without me.
3733073	eng	OK, you two, follow me.
3733084	eng	Tom hated his own name.
3733089	eng	Tom never remembers my name.
3733091	eng	It's always been the same.
3733094	eng	This isn't a good time.
3733106	eng	I've waited a long time.
3733125	eng	I was just in time.
3733144	eng	Tom has been working overtime.
3733145	eng	Tom knew Mary would come.
3733146	eng	Tom has promised to come.
3733153	eng	Tom will soon be home.
3733156	eng	I must be going home.
3733157	eng	I must be getting home.
3733160	eng	They've all gone back home.
3733161	eng	We had to walk home.
3733167	eng	Everybody wanted to go home.
3733172	eng	I'm tired. Let's go home.
3733174	eng	My wife stayed at home.
3733199	eng	I thought it was mine.
3733200	eng	Tom doesn't drink red wine.
3733214	eng	Nothing more could be done.
3733228	eng	Come back when you're done.
3733232	eng	Show Tom how it's done.
3733233	eng	That's the way it's done.
3733236	eng	The police have arrested someone.
3733237	eng	The police did arrest someone.
3733247	eng	I hope we're all alone.
3733248	eng	Tom was sitting all alone.
3733253	eng	I'd rather be left alone.
3733255	eng	We can't do it alone.
3733258	eng	Hard work never hurt anyone.
3733261	eng	I never gave up hope.
3733262	eng	Tom tore open the envelope.
3733263	eng	Tom looked for the rope.
3733268	eng	Tom isn't the squeamish type.
3733270	eng	That's just how things are.
3733272	eng	Remain exactly where you are.
3733278	eng	Tom didn't seem to care.
3733280	eng	Tom rose with great care.
3733281	eng	You're not doing your share.
3733285	eng	This couldn't have happened here.
3733290	eng	I thought you'd be here.
3733307	eng	That's why I came here.
3733309	eng	I like to come here.
3733311	eng	Tipping isn't usually done here.
3733312	eng	There shouldn't be anyone here.
3733315	eng	Please get out of here.
3733317	eng	Something is always happening here.
3733319	eng	I don't like living here.
3733324	eng	The view's good from here.
3733326	eng	It isn't far from here.
3733328	eng	Just get away from here.
3733330	eng	It's very cold in here.
3733331	eng	It's very dark in here.
3733332	eng	It's very hot in here.
3733333	eng	It's very smoky in here.
3733334	eng	It's very noisy in here.
3733340	eng	No one ever comes here.
3733349	eng	Nobody really wants us here.
3733353	eng	Put it down right here.
3733356	eng	Tell Tom I'm not here.
3733358	eng	I want you out here.
3733367	eng	Tom doesn't know anybody here.
3733368	eng	It won't be lonely here.
3733375	eng	Nobody seemed to be there.
3733378	eng	Tom may not be there.
3733381	eng	There was no one there.
3733382	eng	Get Tom out of there.
3733383	eng	It's almost always raining there.
3733397	eng	I was very happy there.
3733401	eng	Tom never took me anywhere.
3733402	eng	Tom couldn't find Mary anywhere.
3733421	eng	You've lied to us before.
3733425	eng	Please don't say anything more.
3733429	eng	Tom never calls me anymore.
3733433	eng	Please don't speak French anymore.
3733448	eng	They looked at the picture.
3733449	eng	Tom looked at Mary's picture.
3733455	eng	I'm worried about my future.
3733461	eng	I want to use these.
3733467	eng	Tom must've forgotten his promise.
3733471	eng	That was a nasty surprise.
3733474	eng	I'm different from everyone else.
3733476	eng	No one did anything else.
3733486	eng	Tom isn't making much sense.
3733497	eng	Tom looked at the horse.
3733498	eng	Tom fell from his horse.
3733508	eng	Tom wouldn't leave the house.
3733511	eng	Tom came to our house.
3733513	eng	We went to Tom's house.
3733523	eng	It was a hot debate.
3733542	eng	It was far too late.
3733543	eng	We realized it too late.
3733557	eng	I think you've been fortunate.
3733566	eng	I should've been more polite.
3733571	eng	Tom enjoys playing the flute.
3733573	eng	This may take a minute.
3733576	eng	I've only got a minute.
3733577	eng	Tom didn't try to argue.
3733580	eng	It just couldn't be true.
3733583	eng	I wonder if it's true.
3733584	eng	What Tom said was true.
3733585	eng	What Tom said wasn't true.
3733588	eng	I bet that's not true.
3733597	eng	It's now time to leave.
3733600	eng	Tom seemed reluctant to leave.
3733606	eng	I think we'd better leave.
3733608	eng	Well, that's all I have.
3733611	eng	I feel like a slave.
3733613	eng	That seems hard to believe.
3733614	eng	That's almost impossible to believe.
3733621	eng	Tom may still be alive.
3733632	eng	Good advice isn't always expensive.
3733640	eng	My plan was very effective.
3733645	eng	Tom nearly lost his nerve.
3733650	eng	I'm feeling a bit stiff.
3733656	eng	The lights are all off.
3733657	eng	The lights are now off.
3733662	eng	Let me get my stuff.
3733664	eng	This is from that shelf.
3733669	eng	Tom was certainly enjoying himself.
3733679	eng	Tom never swims by himself.
3733687	eng	I can't imagine shooting myself.
3733688	eng	Let me look for myself.
3733690	eng	I don't believe it myself.
3733708	eng	I think there's a misunderstanding.
3733709	eng	I want to learn snowboarding.
3733711	eng	I think Tom was bluffing.
3733712	eng	I thought Tom was bluffing.
3733716	eng	Tom heard his telephone ringing.
3733718	eng	Tom suddenly burst out laughing.
3733721	eng	This is the same thing.
3733722	eng	Everyone says the same thing.
3733740	eng	Tom wanted to say something.
3733744	eng	Tom might recommend doing nothing.
3733748	eng	Tom seemed to expect nothing.
3733751	eng	I should've not said anything.
3733756	eng	No one could prove anything.
3733759	eng	Tom wasn't sure of anything.
3733760	eng	Tom nodded without saying anything.
3733766	eng	I could hardly do anything.
3733767	eng	Tom was ready for anything.
3733770	eng	Tom never complained about anything.
3733778	eng	I can sell anybody anything.
3733779	eng	Tom didn't actually say anything.
3733780	eng	Tom never told Mary anything.
3733781	eng	Tom never tells Mary anything.
3733788	eng	There's an answer to everything.
3733792	eng	Tom seems to know everything.
3733797	eng	Let Tom do the talking.
3733798	eng	Everybody except Tom stopped walking.
3733803	eng	Tom wanted to quit smoking.
3733807	eng	The heater has quit working.
3733810	eng	Tom pointed toward the ceiling.
3733827	eng	It was an amazing evening.
3733833	eng	It was a lovely evening.
3733841	eng	Let that be a warning.
3733843	eng	It was a wonderful morning.
3733848	eng	I saw Tom this morning.
3733867	eng	Give me back my ring.
3733876	eng	Tom taught me to sing.
3733882	eng	That must be rather confusing.
3733905	eng	Tom and Mary were fighting.
3733907	eng	Tom got tired of waiting.
3733908	eng	Thanks very much for waiting.
3733910	eng	This might be Tom's handwriting.
3733917	eng	The party was very interesting.
3733920	eng	I know why you're leaving.
3733921	eng	I was thinking of leaving.
3733927	eng	I wish you were staying.
3733935	eng	Tom is afraid of flying.
3733936	eng	Excess of politeness is annoying.
3733944	eng	It won't take me long.
3733945	eng	Tom didn't stay there long.
3733953	eng	I've stayed away too long.
3733956	eng	It shouldn't take us long.
3733957	eng	The rain didn't last long.
3733958	eng	That shouldn't take very long.
3733959	eng	It won't take very long.
3733962	eng	You've been right all along.
3733963	eng	Let's try to get along.
3733965	eng	This is where I belong.
3733969	eng	I think maybe you're wrong.
3733970	eng	I don't think you're wrong.
3733982	eng	Tom realized what was wrong.
3733989	eng	Everyone here looks so young.
3733991	eng	Having fun keeps you young.
3733992	eng	Tom became bald very young.
3733998	eng	This is a typical blog.
3734005	eng	My parents weren't very rich.
3734006	eng	Tom has never studied French.
3734063	eng	It was time for lunch.
3734068	eng	Tom never goes to church.
3734074	eng	You shouldn't do too much.
3734087	eng	Tom couldn't see very much.
3734092	eng	I've missed you very much.
3734099	eng	I think you've practiced enough.
3734101	eng	I think you've said enough.
3734105	eng	I think we've heard enough.
3734107	eng	The place looked big enough.
3734109	eng	We've been waiting long enough.
3734110	eng	I think we've eaten enough.
3734127	eng	I'll do as you wish.
3734130	eng	Let me catch my breath.
3734143	eng	You're afraid of the truth.
3734144	eng	Tom wasn't telling the truth.
3734145	eng	Tom probably took a taxi.
3734146	eng	I can't hear myself speak.
3734151	eng	I was afraid to speak.
3734158	eng	Perhaps I could come back.
3734160	eng	Tom might not come back.
3734161	eng	I think I'll walk back.
3734162	eng	Bad money always comes back.
3734169	eng	Tell Tom to hurry back.
3734171	eng	I have to go pack.
3734173	eng	Perhaps Tom was feeling sick.
3734176	eng	Get ready for a shock.
3734208	eng	I have you to thank.
3734216	eng	Tom poured everyone a drink.
3734217	eng	Let's go have a drink.
3734225	eng	Tom thought you were drunk.
3734228	eng	Tom was obviously very drunk.
3734230	eng	Tom was reading a book.
3734232	eng	Tom has written a book.
3734233	eng	Tom looked in the book.
3734235	eng	Many people like our book.
3734238	eng	Please give me that book.
3734239	eng	Give me back my book.
3734242	eng	I'm scared of the dark.
3734256	eng	I went back to work.
3734273	eng	There was nobody to ask.
3734279	eng	This might be Tom's desk.
3734287	eng	It should be made illegal.
3734296	eng	Tom didn't regret his refusal.
3734303	eng	Tom really wanted to travel.
3734306	eng	Tom visited Mary in jail.
3734308	eng	Tom pulled out a pencil.
3734309	eng	I should've changed the oil.
3734310	eng	Children hate cod liver oil.
3734313	eng	Tom was right after all.
3734315	eng	I'm not scared at all.
3734316	eng	You don't understand at all.
3734318	eng	It wasn't interesting at all.
3734319	eng	It didn't work at all.
3734320	eng	That won't do at all.
3734321	eng	Tom didn't sleep at all.
3734324	eng	They're not busy at all.
3734325	eng	I almost understood it all.
3734326	eng	Tom used to like baseball.
3734330	eng	I want to play football.
3734334	eng	It was a close call.
3734338	eng	Tom plays the harmonica well.
3734343	eng	I remember Tom quite well.
3734344	eng	The patient is doing well.
3734345	eng	The project isn't going well.
3734348	eng	Business isn't going so well.
3734350	eng	I remember your grandfather well.
3734351	eng	I hope everything goes well.
3734354	eng	Tom did his part well.
3734355	eng	You understand me very well.
3734358	eng	Tom did it very well.
3734359	eng	Tom can't paint very well.
3734368	eng	Tom made Mary a doll.
3734370	eng	Sometimes the nights are cool.
3734377	eng	Tom went back to school.
3734385	eng	Tom laughs like a girl.
3734396	eng	Tom has been very careful.
3734406	eng	I think you've been wonderful.
3734430	eng	There was no stopping them.
3734540	eng	The police have arrested Tom.
3734541	eng	I never really trusted Tom.
3734549	eng	I tried to convince Tom.
3734554	eng	Let's go and see Tom.
3734578	eng	I was speaking with Tom.
3734583	eng	Something was wrong with Tom.
3734602	eng	I won't even tell Tom.
3734605	eng	Some people think I'm Tom.
3734607	eng	The note was from Tom.
3734610	eng	I borrowed money from Tom.
3734611	eng	Don't be hard on Tom.
3734614	eng	You can rely on Tom.
3734620	eng	I'll be good to Tom.
3734625	eng	Give my love to Tom.
3734626	eng	Somebody was talking to Tom.
3734637	eng	It didn't matter to Tom.
3734640	eng	This is important to Tom.
3734641	eng	We had to help Tom.
3734649	eng	I'm surprised you remember Tom.
3734650	eng	I looked around for Tom.
3734651	eng	You're too good for Tom.
3734658	eng	I didn't wait for Tom.
3734664	eng	My real name is Tom.
3734666	eng	We all stared at Tom.
3734667	eng	I'm not angry at Tom.
3734669	eng	I'll show that to Tom.
3734673	eng	Everyone was shocked except Tom.
3734675	eng	Someone's going to hurt Tom.
3734678	eng	I know all about Tom.
3734682	eng	I don't worry about Tom.
3734684	eng	I'm glad we saw Tom.
3734698	eng	We don't have enough room.
3734701	eng	Tom wasn't in his room.
3734711	eng	I wonder who it's from.
3734717	eng	It's only another false alarm.
3734726	eng	We do what we can.
3734733	eng	Tom keeps his room clean.
3734734	eng	The air here is clean.
3734735	eng	Tom knows what I mean.
3734736	eng	This is where it began.
3734739	eng	Tom might be a vegetarian.
3734749	eng	Let's stick with the plan.
3734755	eng	I'm glad I'm a man.
3734758	eng	Tom is an old man.
3734759	eng	Tom behaved like a gentleman.
3734760	eng	Tom has been a gentleman.
3734766	eng	Tom was in the garden.
3734780	eng	Tom walked through the kitchen.
3734783	eng	It was dark by then.
3734784	eng	I was so unhappy then.
3734790	eng	Yesterday, my wheelbarrow was stolen.
3734793	eng	All the windows were open.
3734794	eng	The door is still open.
3734796	eng	Luckily the door was open.
3734801	eng	What will happen will happen.
3734805	eng	Something was about to happen.
3734816	eng	The sun has just risen.
3734823	eng	Tom didn't write so often.
3734826	eng	That was a good sign.
3734827	eng	That's always a good sign.
3734828	eng	This isn't a good sign.
3734850	eng	Tom may have come in.
3734851	eng	I want to come in.
3734871	eng	Tom read the note again.
3734874	eng	I think it's happening again.
3734875	eng	The children are crying again.
3734883	eng	I'll never mention Tom again.
3734884	eng	I'll write to Tom again.
3734890	eng	This must not happen again.
3734891	eng	I'll never leave Boston again.
3734894	eng	Tom filled his glass again.
3734896	eng	I won't do that again.
3734903	eng	I could do it again.
3734904	eng	Watch me do it again.
3734906	eng	Let me try it again.
3734909	eng	That'll be hard to explain.
3734911	eng	It's too difficult to explain.
3734916	eng	Tom was in the cabin.
3734918	eng	Tom also plays the violin.
3734921	eng	Tom is Mary's second cousin.
3734925	eng	There's a war going on.
3734940	eng	That's a matter of opinion.
3734942	eng	Tom rose to the occasion.
3734959	eng	Thanks for this useful information.
3734970	eng	Let me explain our situation.
3734975	eng	I should've paid closer attention.
3734977	eng	We've only got one option.
3734979	eng	That's a very interesting question.
3734985	eng	Tom never answered my question.
3734986	eng	This is just a precaution.
3735004	eng	Come and see me soon.
3735012	eng	Tom'll be all right soon.
3735023	eng	Don't blame the wrong person.
3735029	eng	Tom really does like Boston.
3735040	eng	Tom is based in Boston.
3735067	eng	I'd rather live in Boston.
3735069	eng	I'm still living in Boston.
3735081	eng	It's almost midnight in Boston.
3735082	eng	Enjoy your stay in Boston.
3735083	eng	We arrived safely in Boston.
3735111	eng	Tom might go to Boston.
3735114	eng	That's why I left Boston.
3735119	eng	There's no reason for concern.
3735120	eng	Tom has always been stubborn.
3735124	eng	Stay here till I return.
3735126	eng	This job should be fun.
3735130	eng	I thought it was fun.
3735133	eng	It wouldn't be any fun.
3735134	eng	Step away from the gun.
3735148	eng	I put my suitcase down.
3735190	eng	Tom had something to do.
3735191	eng	Tom wants something to do.
3735193	eng	There was nothing to do.
3735203	eng	There's so much to do.
3735233	eng	That's all we ever do.
3735243	eng	Tom might as well go.
3735248	eng	They both wanted to go.
3735250	eng	You're now free to go.
3735256	eng	Tom didn't want to go.
3735262	eng	Tom won't let us go.
3735270	eng	Tom graduated three years ago.
3735279	eng	Tom flipped on the radio.
3735280	eng	Tom didn't regret saying no.
3735281	eng	The answer is still no.
3735302	eng	It may have been so.
3735303	eng	Tom didn't exactly say so.
3735320	eng	I'm afraid it's rather cheap.
3735325	eng	The snow's a foot deep.
3735326	eng	Tom dozed off to sleep.
3735334	eng	The men are all asleep.
3735337	eng	I think everyone is asleep.
3735344	eng	I think everybody should help.
3735345	eng	I said I would help.
3735350	eng	Tom might want some help.
3735362	eng	Well, maybe I can help.
3735364	eng	Tom would've liked to help.
3735366	eng	Tom has promised to help.
3735377	eng	They're just trying to help.
3735389	eng	They may need our help.
3735390	eng	I really appreciate your help.
3735391	eng	We'll be needing your help.
3735410	eng	Tom will never give up.
3735412	eng	The snow is letting up.
3735416	eng	Tom didn't even look up.
3735418	eng	The money will turn up.
3735419	eng	Tom wondered what was up.
3735422	eng	This will cheer you up.
3735430	eng	Step away from the car.
3735431	eng	Tom looked into the car.
3735433	eng	Tom bought a larger car.
3735439	eng	Tom never washes his car.
3735448	eng	Stop yelling in my ear.
3735458	eng	Now you've gone too far.
3735459	eng	This has gone too far.
3735461	eng	Tom couldn't jump that far.
3735476	eng	That's what I can't remember.
3735480	eng	This is my cell number.
3735485	eng	Tom left in early October.
3735488	eng	I'm a really bad dancer.
3735504	eng	Tom might not drink beer.
3735506	eng	They made Tom an offer.
3735508	eng	Tom should be the manager.
3735511	eng	We think you're in danger.
3735532	eng	Tom is a violin teacher.
3735533	eng	Tom is a professional photographer.
3735546	eng	I've just become a grandfather.
3735548	eng	Take care of your grandfather.
3735549	eng	Tom's grandfather knew my grandfather.
3735550	eng	They were left alone together.
3735560	eng	They couldn't understand each other.
3735571	eng	Tom was never a soldier.
3735575	eng	I should've gone home earlier.
3735587	eng	Mary cooked an impressive dinner.
3735596	eng	Here's a piece of paper.
3735627	eng	We're still discussing that matter.
3735634	eng	Your French is getting better.
3735639	eng	Tom tore up the letter.
3735651	eng	I've been thinking it over.
3735652	eng	We must talk it over.
3735668	eng	Tom didn't want to answer.
3735672	eng	You should always be fair.
3735680	eng	That's what I wished for.
3735682	eng	That's what I asked for.
3735690	eng	It's not worth waiting for.
3735694	eng	I like Tom's subtle humor.
3735695	eng	The butler opened the door.
3735697	eng	Tom came to the door.
3735702	eng	Tom has always been poor.
3735704	eng	Tom isn't a stamp collector.
3735706	eng	They may need a doctor.
3735707	eng	Tom might be a doctor.
3735708	eng	Tom's father was a doctor.
3735714	eng	I'll give you an hour.
3735717	eng	I thought it was Tom's.
3735719	eng	These are just crazy ideas.
3735722	eng	Tom knew who I was.
3735725	eng	I wonder who he was.
3735737	eng	Tom wondered what it was.
3735739	eng	That's the way it was.
3735757	eng	Tom must've gained thirty pounds.
3735769	eng	There were no other choices.
3735770	eng	It depends on the circumstances.
3735772	eng	Tom is allergic to bees.
3735773	eng	I'd cut down those trees.
3735782	eng	Tom read me some stories.
3735792	eng	I've made so many mistakes.
3735796	eng	We gave Tom some apples.
3735801	eng	Tom did it three times.
3735810	eng	Tom looked at his shoes.
3735812	eng	Tom stared at the pictures.
3735824	eng	It got on my nerves.
3735828	eng	You have beautiful blue eyes.
3735835	eng	Tom taught me many things.
3735837	eng	Tom couldn't hide his feelings.
3735838	eng	Mary took off her earrings.
3735841	eng	Tom's mother didn't like dogs.
3735860	eng	I know why that is.
3735870	eng	Wait till you see this.
3735873	eng	I want to use this.
3735876	eng	Tom would enjoy doing this.
3735889	eng	Wait, we can't do this.
3735902	eng	I thought you'd enjoy this.
3735906	eng	This is a major crisis.
3735908	eng	Tom pulled off his socks.
3735925	eng	We're staying in different hotels.
3735926	eng	Tom never uses paper towels.
3735928	eng	Tom paid all his bills.
3735930	eng	This box weighs three kilograms.
3735933	eng	There shouldn't be any problems.
3735945	eng	We didn't reach any conclusions.
3735948	eng	We must follow their instructions.
3735953	eng	Please don't ask unnecessary questions.
3735956	eng	Tom and Mary took turns.
3735958	eng	Tom didn't move his lips.
3735966	eng	That shovel costs thirty dollars.
3735967	eng	That shovel cost thirty dollars.
3735968	eng	Tom handed me the binoculars.
3735970	eng	Tom is terrified of spiders.
3735980	eng	Tom searched the kitchen drawers.
3735981	eng	Tom brought you some flowers.
3735986	eng	The leaves have changed colors.
3736001	eng	Tom poured himself another glass.
3736003	eng	The show was a success.
3736008	eng	Tom wanted to play chess.
3736018	eng	I can't find Tom's address.
3736022	eng	That was a lucky guess.
3736024	eng	I didn't like my boss.
3736026	eng	We must face the facts.
3736027	eng	There were no more blankets.
3736028	eng	I don't have any pets.
3736041	eng	Children often imitate their parents.
3736042	eng	Tom seldom goes to concerts.
3736044	eng	I'll pay whatever it costs.
3736046	eng	Tom may have heard us.
3736052	eng	Tom would never forgive us.
3736090	eng	You can't go with us.
3736097	eng	This building belongs to us.
3736118	eng	There's nothing to stop us.
3736119	eng	There's a place for us.
3736128	eng	Tom might've forgotten about us.
3736129	eng	Tom never even saw us.
3736134	eng	I don't see anything suspicious.
3736136	eng	I hope it's nothing serious.
3736165	eng	Well, I have some news.
3736166	eng	Tom opened the bedroom windows.
3736168	eng	I think no one knows.
3736173	eng	Tom stayed for several days.
3736180	eng	Let's see what Tom says.
3736196	eng	There was nothing to eat.
3736199	eng	The engine's starting to overheat.
3736201	eng	Tom still doesn't eat meat.
3736205	eng	That would be a treat.
3736209	eng	That was a good hat.
3736212	eng	I shouldn't have downloaded that.
3736213	eng	Tom wouldn't have liked that.
3736216	eng	Please forget I said that.
3736224	eng	Don't give up like that.
3736237	eng	I've always hated doing that.
3736239	eng	Tom doesn't like doing that.
3736240	eng	I can't imagine doing that.
3736245	eng	Tom knew about all that.
3736246	eng	I've already told Tom that.
3736249	eng	I must tell Tom that.
3736254	eng	Tom was interested in that.
3736311	eng	I just won't do that.
3736312	eng	Even Tom doesn't do that.
3736318	eng	I don't object to that.
3736321	eng	I was prepared for that.
3736322	eng	It's too soon for that.
3736330	eng	Tom would never admit that.
3736332	eng	There's no mistake about that.
3736334	eng	I remember something about that.
3736339	eng	Tom is wrong about that.
3736342	eng	There's no doubt about that.
3736343	eng	Tom was right about that.
3736345	eng	Tom wasn't right about that.
3736349	eng	Don't let Tom know that.
3736358	eng	I knew you'd enjoy that.
3736360	eng	I took off my coat.
3736362	eng	I've already signed the contract.
3736384	eng	Tom is wearing a jacket.
3736386	eng	Mary took off her bracelet.
3736398	eng	Tom searched inside the closet.
3736401	eng	I know why you're upset.
3736408	eng	Hasn't Tom come home yet?
3736409	eng	I haven't told anyone yet.
3736413	eng	I haven't seen anything yet.
3736414	eng	The kettle isn't boiling yet.
3736415	eng	The water isn't boiling yet.
3736417	eng	Tom hasn't studied French yet.
3736418	eng	They haven't come back yet.
3736419	eng	Tom hasn't come back yet.
3736422	eng	I haven't seen Tom yet.
3736428	eng	The day isn't over yet.
3736429	eng	The honeymoon's not over yet.
3736432	eng	I haven't opened it yet.
3736434	eng	Tom hasn't kissed Mary yet.
3736440	eng	Health is the greatest gift.
3736458	eng	It was a warm night.
3736461	eng	I never slept that night.
3736462	eng	It was a hot night.
3736468	eng	Mary looked beautiful last night.
3736469	eng	We saw Tom last night.
3736473	eng	Tom was cranky last night.
3736490	eng	Tom pointed to the right.
3736497	eng	The creek's to our right.
3736499	eng	I knew I was right.
3736506	eng	It was an awful sight.
3736509	eng	It isn't what I thought.
3736523	eng	I think we found it.
3736527	eng	I think we made it.
3736533	eng	Tom just didn't like it.
3736536	eng	Tom might not like it.
3736538	eng	I know you'll love it.
3736539	eng	I'll try to memorize it.
3736542	eng	Tom wouldn't hear of it.
3736543	eng	I saw Tom doing it.
3736546	eng	Perhaps it was worth it.
3736551	eng	I saw Tom do it.
3736560	eng	They're going to do it.
3736574	eng	We're still checking into it.
3736575	eng	I must look into it.
3736580	eng	I really don't remember it.
3736599	eng	Tom knows nothing about it.
3736601	eng	We're still talking about it.
3736607	eng	I do worry about it.
3736610	eng	It's impossible to fix it.
3736613	eng	Tom said he would wait.
3736614	eng	It's not worth the wait.
3736617	eng	You may have to wait.
3736623	eng	I should've added more salt.
3736624	eng	Tom knew what I felt.
3736628	eng	It's all your own fault.
3736629	eng	This is your own fault.
3736630	eng	Perhaps it isn't your fault.
3736631	eng	This is no one's fault.
3736632	eng	That was perhaps Tom's fault.
3736634	eng	That was Tom's only fault.
3736635	eng	This could be my fault.
3736636	eng	It wasn't all my fault.
3736638	eng	That really wasn't my fault.
3736645	eng	The test was very difficult.
3736646	eng	That was what I meant.
3736648	eng	I see what Tom meant.
3736649	eng	That was what Tom meant.
3736652	eng	Tom knew what Mary meant.
3736656	eng	This had better be important.
3736658	eng	Tom says it's quite important.
3736667	eng	They're exactly what we want.
3736669	eng	That's exactly what we want.
3736681	eng	Tom seemed a little impatient.
3736684	eng	The cabin was absolutely silent.
3736686	eng	It's dark in the basement.
3736691	eng	Tom stared at the document.
3736712	eng	Well, that's all I've got.
3736715	eng	It was a lucky shot.
3736716	eng	Tom is a complete idiot.
3736719	eng	I'm enjoying myself a lot.
3736722	eng	Well, that helps a lot.
3736723	eng	My knee hurts a lot.
3736725	eng	I've missed you a lot.
3736738	eng	Someone stepped on my foot.
3736743	eng	Tom doesn't seem very smart.
3736749	eng	You would've liked the concert.
3736758	eng	There's nothing new to report.
3736759	eng	I really appreciate your support.
3736764	eng	Tom might be badly hurt.
3736772	eng	Tom didn't want any breakfast.
3736774	eng	Tom's plan seemed the best.
3736775	eng	Tom's plan seems the best.
3736778	eng	Tom has done his best.
3736780	eng	I was trying my best.
3736791	eng	This isn't a fair test.
3736797	eng	Tom is a fine violinist.
3736801	eng	Fortunately, no lives were lost.
3736806	eng	Tom seemed frightened at first.
3736807	eng	Tom was confused at first.
3736809	eng	This will quench your thirst.
3736813	eng	Tom kept his eyes shut.
3736817	eng	The concert was sold out.
3736821	eng	The fire has gone out.
3736827	eng	I don't like eating out.
3736832	eng	Tom was completely worn out.
3736834	eng	I've got to go out.
3736837	eng	Tom couldn't figure it out.
3736838	eng	The candle suddenly went out.
3736839	eng	There was no way out.
3736847	eng	That's all we talk about.
3736858	eng	I don't quite understand you.
3736876	eng	I'm still afraid of you.
3736877	eng	Well, I'm proud of you.
3736879	eng	I've had enough of you.
3736883	eng	Tom never stopped loving you.
3736886	eng	I'll soon be with you.
3736911	eng	I'm not interested in you.
3736914	eng	I didn't tell on you.
3736919	eng	It might happen to you.
3736928	eng	Perhaps Tom can help you.
3736931	eng	Well, I can't help you.
3736937	eng	No one will bother you.
3736940	eng	Well, I waited for you.
3736943	eng	Well, I'm here for you.
3736945	eng	I'll do anything for you.
3736951	eng	There's a call for you.
3736959	eng	I was ready for you.
3736963	eng	Tom wasn't mad at you.
3736967	eng	I've got nothing against you.
3736969	eng	Tom often talks about you.
3736972	eng	I couldn't live without you.
3736979	eng	Mary doesn't like her mother-in-law.
3736984	eng	Tom knew what Mary knew.
3736990	eng	Tom never opens that window.
3736995	eng	Please don't leave me now.
3736998	eng	I'm going back there now.
3736999	eng	This is your house now.
3737013	eng	I ought to go now.
3737036	eng	We're eating dinner right now.
3737037	eng	We're having dinner right now.
3737042	eng	I'm very busy right now.
3737043	eng	Tell me about it now.
3737047	eng	I can't tell you now.
3737055	eng	Well, just let me know.
3737063	eng	It's too early to know.
3737077	eng	We'd better wait until tomorrow.
3737091	eng	Tom kicked the wooden box.
3737098	eng	This is my wedding day.
3737099	eng	The picnic lasted all day.
3737103	eng	It was a wonderful day.
3737118	eng	I must leave on Monday.
3737122	eng	Tom is coming next Monday.
3737135	eng	You sure worked hard today.
3737148	eng	It'll be crowded everywhere today.
3737150	eng	Tom might be late today.
3737155	eng	I've done nothing interesting today.

3737202	eng	I have more to say.
3737206	eng	There's so much to say.
3737212	eng	I think I can't stay.

3737270	eng	I have very little money.
3737271	eng	They may need some money.
3737285	eng	Tom had plenty of money.
3737291	eng	All Tom needed was money.
3737305	eng	Everyone wants to be healthy.
3737306	eng	My parents weren't very wealthy.
3737310	eng	I think you've been lucky.
3737314	eng	Tom pointed at the sky.

3737504	eng	Suddenly Tom began to cry.

3737602	eng	Life is one big party.
3737623	eng	I thought you'd be thirsty.
3737628	eng	I really am very thirsty.

3818288	eng	Have you kissed Tom yet?
3818290	eng	Why aren't you home yet?
3818299	eng	I haven't fixed that yet.
3818303	eng	I haven't finished this yet.
3818305	eng	The holidays aren't over yet.
3818310	eng	We haven't found Tom yet.
3818312	eng	I don't have enough yet.
3818313	eng	I haven't been shopping yet.
3818314	eng	We don't know anything yet.
3818315	eng	I haven't received anything yet.
3818316	eng	I haven't achieved anything yet.
3818318	eng	I haven't been there yet.
3818326	eng	No one has voted yet.
3818328	eng	How was the party yesterday?
3818329	eng	How was your interview yesterday?
3818333	eng	How was the meeting yesterday?
3818337	eng	How was the picnic yesterday?
3818346	eng	I should've done that yesterday.
3818347	eng	Tom should've done this yesterday.
3818352	eng	I worked until seven yesterday.
3818353	eng	We didn't have school yesterday.
3818354	eng	I didn't do much yesterday.
3818355	eng	Tom didn't eat lunch yesterday.
3818360	eng	Why did you say yes?
3818361	eng	My answer is still yes.
3818368	eng	Where were you last year?
3818372	eng	I visited Boston last year.
3818374	eng	Tom worked here last year.
3818375	eng	Tom's father died last year.
3818379	eng	Spring came late this year.
3818380	eng	I'm getting married this year.
3818382	eng	What did I say wrong?
3818384	eng	Who said I was wrong?
3818385	eng	You look sad. What's wrong?
3818389	eng	Are you saying I'm wrong?
3818391	eng	Have you done something wrong?
3818400	eng	Well, I guess I'm wrong.
3818403	eng	You have it all wrong.
3818405	eng	You didn't say anything wrong.
3818406	eng	You never do anything wrong.
3818407	eng	I'm not doing anything wrong.
3818409	eng	I don't see anything wrong.
3818410	eng	We can't find anything wrong.
3818414	eng	You did this one wrong.
3818415	eng	You always get me wrong.
3818420	eng	Tom is a good writer.
3818427	eng	Tom didn't say anything worthwhile.
3818431	eng	Next year will be worse.
3818433	eng	You have to stop worrying.
3818434	eng	I have to stop worrying.
3818435	eng	I try not to worry.
3818439	eng	Is that how it works?
3818443	eng	We hope that it works.
3818444	eng	It seems that everything works.
3818465	eng	Tell us where you work.
3818475	eng	I can't go to work.
3818485	eng	Those were Tom's last words.
3818488	eng	I don't like that word.
3818489	eng	Tom didn't say another word.
3818490	eng	I used the wrong word.
3818491	eng	They didn't say a word.
3818492	eng	I'm still a little woozy.
3818493	eng	They went into the woods.
3818495	eng	We don't know who won.
3818497	eng	I still don't understand women.
3818506	eng	What are they armed with?
3818512	eng	It'll be a long winter.
3818514	eng	There's no chance of winning.
3818518	eng	How about a little wine?
3818522	eng	Go easy on the wine.
3818524	eng	May I open the windows?
3818527	eng	Stop looking out the window.
3818538	eng	May the best man win.
3818543	eng	It looks like a wig.
3818545	eng	Don't you love your wife?
3818549	eng	I needed to know why.
3818551	eng	Tom won't tell me why.
3818553	eng	Why are you always whining?
3818554	eng	You must wait a while.
3818562	eng	Your hair's not even wet.
3818570	eng	Tell me how it went.
3818571	eng	Do they pay you well?
3818573	eng	How deep is this well?
3818577	eng	Are you all doing well?
3818581	eng	I remember it very well.
3818584	eng	This book sells very well.
3818588	eng	My books sell very well.
3818590	eng	I speak French very well.
3818597	eng	They've spent their money well.
3818598	eng	This time it went well.
3818599	eng	I'm sure you meant well.
3818601	eng	I can't write that well.
3818608	eng	Did the surgery go well?
3818610	eng	I'm not at all well.
3818611	eng	I think you're doing well.
3818616	eng	Constructive criticism is always welcome.
3818618	eng	Some people are just weird.
3818630	eng	Did you enjoy your weekend?
3818641	eng	Let's meet again next week.
3818647	eng	I played here last week.
3818659	eng	What do you usually wear?
3818668	eng	I wouldn't go that way.
3818670	eng	Let's try it this way.
3818678	eng	Don't use too much water.
3818681	eng	Tom wanted to conserve water.
3818683	eng	I was in the water.
3818684	eng	What channel are you watching?
3818691	eng	Tom wondered who Mary was.
3818695	eng	I remember what it was.
3818696	eng	I wonder who it was.
3818697	eng	I wondered who it was.
3818709	eng	I need a new wardrobe.
3818711	eng	That's what the government wants.
3818721	eng	Here's the recipe you wanted.
3818722	eng	I forgot what Tom wanted.
3818728	eng	It wasn't what I wanted.
3818731	eng	What do you really want?
3818733	eng	What flavor do you want?
3818738	eng	Think about what you want.
3818739	eng	Just do what you want.
3818741	eng	Show me what you want.
3818742	eng	Call me what you want.
3818745	eng	Tell me anything you want.
3818750	eng	I know what people want.
3818751	eng	This is all I want.
3818755	eng	Has anyone found a wallet?
3818761	eng	Are we going to walk?
3818767	eng	Will we have to wait?
3818769	eng	I know you can't wait.
3818770	eng	You know I can't wait.
3818771	eng	Tom told Mary to wait.
3818773	eng	It wasn't worth the wait.
3818777	eng	Ask Tom if he voted.
3818778	eng	No one deserves my vote.
3818780	eng	I'm definitely going to vote.
3818781	eng	Who wants to play volleyball?
3818790	eng	I really appreciate your visit.
3818796	eng	Have you seen this video?
3818797	eng	This is my new video.
3818799	eng	I really like this video.
3818810	eng	Is it really so valuable?
3818816	eng	It was an unforgettable vacation.
3818820	eng	You look uglier than usual.
3818822	eng	Did you learn anything useful?
3818824	eng	I want to be useful.
3818825	eng	Where's the hammer you used?
3818829	eng	Do you worry about us?
3818832	eng	Why don't you trust us?
3818833	eng	Why did you interrupt us?
3818846	eng	Why would they attack us?
3818850	eng	Why are they attacking us?
3818854	eng	They threw spears at us.
3818857	eng	Tom did it for us.
3818863	eng	They were waiting for us.
3818865	eng	The rain didn't stop us.
3818879	eng	You said you'd help us.
3818881	eng	Please don't lie to us.
3818882	eng	They tried to poison us.
3818883	eng	Ask Tom to join us.
3818891	eng	Tom couldn't go with us.
3818919	eng	Tom didn't come with us.
3818924	eng	Tom didn't agree with us.
3818925	eng	Thank you for choosing us.
3818926	eng	Thank you for joining us.
3818927	eng	Tom left without telling us.
3818928	eng	Pray for all of us.
3818935	eng	Why are you still upset?
3818939	eng	I know that Tom's upset.
3818940	eng	Tom said you were upset.
3818942	eng	I was a little upset.
3818945	eng	Would you please shut up?
3818953	eng	You need to shut up.
3818957	eng	I just made that up.
3818965	eng	I definitely won't give up.
3818968	eng	It's time to wake up.
3818969	eng	I can barely stand up.
3818971	eng	The numbers don't add up.
3818974	eng	I believe this was unnecessary.
3818982	eng	It doesn't sound so unlikely.
3818984	eng	We all sang in unison.
3818988	eng	You've made me very unhappy.
3818992	eng	What you're doing is unforgivable.
3818994	eng	What you've done is unethical.
3818995	eng	I thought Tom was unemployed.
3818996	eng	I thought they were unemployed.
3818997	eng	I thought you were unemployed.
3819001	eng	It's something I can't understand.
3819002	eng	Some people will never understand.
3819003	eng	I'll help you to understand.
3819004	eng	It wasn't difficult to understand.
3819006	eng	It wasn't hard to understand.
3819021	eng	I didn't take your umbrella.
3819025	eng	Maybe I wasn't Tom's type.
3819029	eng	I'm not saying this twice.
3819031	eng	You watch too much TV.
3819033	eng	I feel like watching TV.
3819035	eng	I think it's my turn.
3819038	eng	It would be worth trying.
3819039	eng	Would you like to try?
3819042	eng	It's useless to even try.
3819045	eng	Did Tom tell the truth?
3819049	eng	We just want the truth.
3819051	eng	I always tell the truth.
3819054	eng	Tom should tell the truth.
3819056	eng	Tom simply told the truth.
3819058	eng	Would you open the trunk?
3819061	eng	Tom was playing the trumpet.
3819064	eng	Do you think it's true?
3819072	eng	We hope this is true.
3819075	eng	We hope it's all true.
3819080	eng	It's unlikely to be true.
3819086	eng	Do you play the trombone?
3819096	eng	This is an equilateral triangle.
3819097	eng	This is a beautiful tree.
3819105	eng	Are you taking the train?
3819106	eng	I went there by train.
3819108	eng	I've never traveled by train.
3819109	eng	I'm already on the train.
3819110	eng	See you on the train.
3819111	eng	Tom remained on the train.
3819112	eng	I'll catch the 2:30 train.
3819116	eng	Tom headed back to town.
3819125	eng	Did you enjoy your tour?
3819126	eng	I was on a tour.
3819127	eng	Next year will be tough.
3819128	eng	I know it'll be tough.
3819131	eng	Do you have a toothache?
3819135	eng	Did you know that, too?
3819136	eng	Did you buy potatoes, too?
3819138	eng	I feel very hungry, too.
3819140	eng	I feel very sleepy, too.
3819143	eng	I hate Valentine's Day, too.
3819146	eng	Tom can help you, too.
3819148	eng	You can do it, too.
3819161	eng	My name is Tom, too.
3819163	eng	Next time, I'm coming, too.
3819164	eng	I want to leave, too.
3819165	eng	Tom broke that promise, too.
3819169	eng	It happens to me, too.
3819170	eng	It happened to me, too.
3819171	eng	I feel very tired, too.
3819172	eng	This time, I'm scared, too.
3819175	eng	Could I see you tonight?
3819177	eng	Is everything ready for tonight?
3819183	eng	We're having a party tonight.
3819189	eng	There's party at Tom's tonight.
3819190	eng	I'm going to Tom's tonight.
3819193	eng	Let's go drinking together tonight.
3819202	eng	This box weighs a ton.
3819203	eng	Can you decide by tomorrow?
3819204	eng	Can I see you tomorrow?
3819206	eng	Can't you wait until tomorrow?
3819212	eng	I can call you tomorrow.
3819213	eng	Can I call you tomorrow?
3819214	eng	I'll go with you tomorrow.
3819217	eng	It'll be very hot tomorrow.
3819225	eng	I need your answer tomorrow.
3819230	eng	I'm going to work tomorrow.
3819232	eng	I'll buy a backpack tomorrow.
3819233	eng	Tom will be arriving tomorrow.
3819236	eng	Explain it to me tomorrow.
3819238	eng	I might be dead tomorrow.
3819244	eng	Did you just hit Tom?
3819253	eng	Why did you poison Tom?
3819255	eng	Don't you call him Tom?
3819256	eng	Why shouldn't I tell Tom?
3819257	eng	Don't you ever call Tom?
3819258	eng	What did you ask Tom?
3819267	eng	Why don't you leave Tom?
3819273	eng	How did you convince Tom?
3819278	eng	What's the matter now, Tom?
3819280	eng	How old are you, Tom?
3819284	eng	Are you all right, Tom?
3819286	eng	Don't you think so, Tom?
3819288	eng	What do you mean, Tom?
3819289	eng	How do you feel, Tom?
3819298	eng	I'm being harassed by Tom.
3819299	eng	I felt lost without Tom.
3819301	eng	I still think about Tom.
3819313	eng	I know that wasn't Tom.
3819321	eng	I couldn't wait for Tom.
3819322	eng	I'll keep it for Tom.
3819333	eng	Just don't vote for Tom.
3819334	eng	Please don't vote for Tom.
3819345	eng	You said you'd help Tom.
3819349	eng	I'll mention it to Tom.
3819351	eng	We'll leave it to Tom.
3819355	eng	This book belongs to Tom.
3819357	eng	Don't give them to Tom.
3819358	eng	Tell the truth to Tom.
3819368	eng	I'll have to warn Tom.
3819374	eng	Here's the letter from Tom.
3819375	eng	Here's a letter from Tom.
3819377	eng	Maybe you should call Tom.
3819381	eng	Don't get angry with Tom.
3819382	eng	I spent Monday with Tom.
3819384	eng	I discussed it with Tom.
3819386	eng	I shook hands with Tom.
3819400	eng	I share everything with Tom.
3819403	eng	I almost agree with Tom.
3819404	eng	I don't agree with Tom.
3819409	eng	That reminds me of Tom.
3819410	eng	It reminds me of Tom.
3819411	eng	This reminds me of Tom.
3819425	eng	I knew you'd like Tom.
3819434	eng	I wanted to be Tom.
3819435	eng	I'll help you find Tom.
3819439	eng	We shouldn't have told Tom.
3819448	eng	I've got it now, Tom.
3819449	eng	I won't forget you, Tom.
3819451	eng	I can't help you, Tom.
3819453	eng	I'm jealous of you, Tom.
3819454	eng	I don't like you, Tom.
3819455	eng	Pardon me a moment, Tom.
3819458	eng	Tell me the news, Tom.
3819461	eng	We know all this, Tom.
3819463	eng	Pass me the sugar, Tom.
3819475	eng	You don't understand me, Tom.
3819480	eng	Remember to flush the toilet.
3819484	eng	Do you two work together?
3819485	eng	Do you three work together?
3819486	eng	Why can't we be together?
3819489	eng	We wrote the report together.
3819499	eng	We make every decision together.
3819502	eng	Let's write a book together.
3819503	eng	Let's go to lunch together.
3819504	eng	I thought you were together.
3819512	eng	Are you going out today?
3819517	eng	Are the shops open today?
3819524	eng	Where are we going today?
3819525	eng	What've you been doing today?
3819526	eng	Why are you working today?
3819542	eng	The situation is different today.
3819543	eng	Your voice sounds different today.
3819549	eng	I wish it was today.
3819554	eng	I've nothing to do today.
3819557	eng	You're going to win today.
3819563	eng	I have to work today.
3819566	eng	Tom just got back today.
3819567	eng	I've eaten too much today.
3819568	eng	I started studying French today.
3819572	eng	I haven't eaten anything today.
3819575	eng	I broke a vase today.
3819576	eng	That's where we were today.
3819577	eng	We're not going anywhere today.
3819579	eng	I started working here today.
3819588	eng	Many restaurants are closed today.
3819589	eng	Your article was published today.
3819600	eng	Where did you move to?
3819641	eng	I think you look tired.
3819653	eng	Do you still have time?
3819658	eng	I'll explain it next time.
3819659	eng	We'll make it next time.
3819660	eng	It'll be better next time.
3819668	eng	The only problem is time.
3819674	eng	Yesterday, I had no time.
3819688	eng	Tom didn't come in time.
3819693	eng	Don't waste too much time.
3819694	eng	I didn't lose much time.
3819715	eng	They lie all the time.
3819720	eng	It's not a good time.
3819724	eng	This coat is too tight.
3819729	eng	We've sold all the tickets.
3819731	eng	How much is a ticket?
3819732	eng	I'll pay for Tom's ticket.
3819735	eng	Tom didn't have a ticket.
3819736	eng	Have you thought this through?
3819737	eng	Would you let me through?
3819742	eng	That sounds like a threat.
3819744	eng	That's a very depressing thought.
3819749	eng	I'll need several of those.
3819756	eng	Are you bothered by this?
3819757	eng	How could you allow this?
3819765	eng	Why do you want this?
3819766	eng	Why would I want this?
3819768	eng	Have you looked at this?
3819772	eng	Where did you hear this?
3819773	eng	When did you do this?
3819781	eng	Why shouldn't I do this?
3819782	eng	Does Tom know all this?
3819786	eng	Why are we discussing this?
3819788	eng	Would you mind holding this?
3819790	eng	Did you approve of this?
3819794	eng	Are you always like this?
3819795	eng	When did we decide this?
3819798	eng	I know you'll enjoy this.
3819799	eng	Maybe we can fix this.
3819801	eng	We were talking about this.
3819815	eng	I'm trying to do this.
3819825	eng	It's important I do this.
3819832	eng	I don't deserve all this.
3819833	eng	Let me just finish this.
3819841	eng	Look, I'm not doing this.
3819842	eng	You won't regret doing this.
3819852	eng	I know you'll appreciate this.
3819854	eng	Look, I can handle this.
3819855	eng	I hope you like this.
3819856	eng	It always happens like this.
3819858	eng	You can't live like this.
3819859	eng	We can't continue like this.
3819860	eng	You can't die like this.
3819861	eng	Maybe I should take this.
3819874	eng	I knew you'd be thirsty.
3819884	eng	Who cares what you think?
3819885	eng	Tom, what do you think?
3819886	eng	Who cares what I think?
3819900	eng	This is accurate, I think.
3819903	eng	Now I understand many things.
3819906	eng	I already have my things.
3819909	eng	They're two very different things.
3819912	eng	I had the wrong things.
3819913	eng	Maybe I'm just hearing things.
3819917	eng	I'm used to these things.
3819921	eng	I want the real thing.
3819922	eng	That's a very strange-looking thing.
3819930	eng	I won't touch a thing.
3819931	eng	I don't understand a thing.
3819932	eng	I didn't understand a thing.
3819933	eng	You haven't changed a thing.
3819936	eng	The police arrested the thief.
3819948	eng	Are you still out there?
3819957	eng	Why were you even there?
3819961	eng	What are you doing there?
3819963	eng	How many cops are there?
3819964	eng	Could you take me there?
3819965	eng	What did you see there?
3819969	eng	Tom is probably already there.
3819979	eng	My office is over there.
3819981	eng	The stairs are over there.
3819982	eng	Let's go back up there.
3819984	eng	I've decided to go there.
3819985	eng	I decided to go there.
3819988	eng	We can't leave Tom there.
3819991	eng	That's why we were there.
3819994	eng	You can't send me there.
3819997	eng	I hope to be there.
3820001	eng	I couldn't even be there.
3820004	eng	Tom could still be there.
3820005	eng	Of course, I'll be there.
3820009	eng	Tom will need physical therapy.
3820010	eng	Tom is a speech therapist.
3820011	eng	Do you have any theories?
3820022	eng	Where should we put them?
3820023	eng	Is this what scares them?
3820024	eng	How do we stop them?
3820026	eng	Did you deal with them?
3820027	eng	What was wrong with them?
3820028	eng	Did you agree with them?
3820035	eng	Let's go and meet them.
3820037	eng	This is what scares them.
3820038	eng	I feel sorry for them.
3820039	eng	Now we're ready for them.
3820041	eng	I have confidence in them.
3820043	eng	I'm very angry with them.
3820045	eng	There were lots of them.
3820046	eng	There were three of them.
3820047	eng	There are three of them.
3820048	eng	I've never heard of them.
3820049	eng	I'd love to see them.
3820055	eng	We went to the theater.
3820057	eng	Did you already know that?
3820066	eng	What's so good about that?
3820068	eng	Do you really want that?
3820069	eng	Why do you want that?
3820072	eng	How could you miss that?
3820077	eng	Would you swear to that?
3820078	eng	Did we actually do that?
3820081	eng	Did you ever do that?
3820099	eng	What would you call that?
3820102	eng	Why did you steal that?
3820103	eng	What makes you ask that?
3820104	eng	Why would I think that?
3820105	eng	Don't you remember doing that?
3820106	eng	Would you stop doing that?
3820107	eng	Why are we doing that?
3820108	eng	Why are you reading that?
3820111	eng	Are you certain of that?
3820113	eng	Are you capable of that?
3820115	eng	How would you rate that?
3820116	eng	Have you ever done that?
3820121	eng	Do you really like that?
3820123	eng	Why couldn't I see that?
3820124	eng	When did you decide that?
3820131	eng	Why would you read that?
3820132	eng	Tom must've given Mary that.
3820135	eng	I thought you'd enjoy that.
3820136	eng	All my friends say that.
3820140	eng	Tom used to say that.
3820143	eng	Well, I never knew that.
3820144	eng	Let me worry about that.
3820154	eng	I told Tom about that.
3820155	eng	We know all about that.
3820156	eng	Let me think about that.
3820157	eng	Let's not talk about that.
3820159	eng	I've been worrying about that.
3820160	eng	I'm not asking about that.
3820168	eng	Tom wasn't kidding about that.
3820170	eng	I hadn't heard about that.
3820177	eng	Wow, you're good at that.
3820179	eng	Thanks for telling us that.
3820181	eng	Nobody blames you for that.
3820182	eng	I love you for that.
3820184	eng	Don't blame me for that.
3820187	eng	I want to remember that.
3820188	eng	We need to remember that.
3820189	eng	Oh yeah, I remember that.
3820206	eng	You would never do that.
3820217	eng	I forgot to do that.
3820233	eng	We're unwilling to do that.
3820235	eng	I refuse to do that.
3820242	eng	I intend to do that.
3820243	eng	They're paid to do that.
3820247	eng	I had to do that.
3820250	eng	I can still do that.
3820261	eng	We'll do more than that.
3820266	eng	I'll help you with that.
3820272	eng	I had trouble doing that.
3820274	eng	I won't be doing that.
3820279	eng	Don't be afraid of that.
3820282	eng	I'll see Tom before that.
3820289	eng	Thanks for telling me that.
3820291	eng	I was just like that.
3820297	eng	I used to like that.
3820298	eng	We're not all like that.
3820302	eng	I'd love something like that.
3820304	eng	Maybe we can change that.
3820307	eng	I still can't understand that.
3820318	eng	Maybe I just imagined that.
3820323	eng	I'll send you a text.
3820324	eng	It was a tough test.
3820335	eng	I always enjoy playing tennis.
3820336	eng	I couldn't resist the temptation.
3820338	eng	I feel like watching television.
3820340	eng	I just brushed my teeth.
3820341	eng	Now go brush your teeth.
3820344	eng	Tom is on our team.
3820353	eng	You can't be my teacher.
3820354	eng	That could be my teacher.
3820355	eng	I had a great teacher.
3820366	eng	You're not a good teacher.
3820367	eng	I have a good teacher.
3820381	eng	You have very good tastes.
3820382	eng	This is an important task.
3820383	eng	It was an impossible task.
3820389	eng	Where was this photo taken?
3820392	eng	Please don't move these tables.
3820402	eng	It's part of the system.
3820408	eng	Who taught you to swim?
3820409	eng	Is Tom going to swim?
3820414	eng	Tom doesn't want to swim.
3820419	eng	Did you notice anything suspicious?
3820421	eng	Tom didn't notice anything suspicious.
3820423	eng	Do you think I'll survive?
3820425	eng	I don't trust these surveys.
3820427	eng	There will be some surprises.
3820430	eng	That's why I'm not surprised.
3820432	eng	I'm not a bit surprised.
3820433	eng	I'm not really that surprised.
3820435	eng	I like to be surprised.
3820436	eng	It was a pleasant surprise.
3820437	eng	It was a welcome surprise.
3820438	eng	I won't spoil the surprise.
3820441	eng	This news was a surprise.
3820447	eng	I'll be there for sure.
3820449	eng	I had to be sure.
3820472	eng	Have you packed your suitcase?
3820473	eng	Someone else took my suitcase.
3820483	eng	I hope you didn't suffer.
3820486	eng	Last year was quite successful.
3820490	eng	It takes courage to succeed.
3820498	eng	I haven't renewed my subscription.
3820500	eng	Can I change the subject?
3820503	eng	Do you think it's stupid?
3820504	eng	Why are you so stupid?
3820507	eng	I must be completely stupid.
3820514	eng	You must really be stupid.
3820515	eng	Did you see that stuff?
3820523	eng	It was really good stuff.
3820529	eng	Can you help me study?
3820531	eng	You should continue to study.
3820532	eng	Tom is an above-average student.
3820533	eng	Do you think I'm stubborn?
3820534	eng	You know I'm very stubborn.
3820539	eng	My boss is very strict.
3820541	eng	Are you under any stress?
3820542	eng	I can't cope with stress.
3820546	eng	I live on Park Street.
3820552	eng	Don't accept rides from strangers.
3820554	eng	Did you notice anything strange?
3820555	eng	Have you noticed anything strange?
3820556	eng	I think it's very strange.
3820559	eng	It all seems so strange.
3820561	eng	I don't see anything strange.
3820568	eng	We can't publish this story.
3820570	eng	This isn't a believable story.
3820573	eng	Tell me your life story.
3820580	eng	Boston was our first stop.
3820592	eng	My car has been stolen.
3820600	eng	Tom doesn't like his stepmother.
3820605	eng	Where's the nearest bus station?
3820606	eng	This is the right station.
3820608	eng	Canada borders the United States.
3820610	eng	I hope you don't starve.
3820611	eng	We don't have to starve.
3820619	eng	This is a good start.
3820626	eng	Tom walked off the stage.
3820628	eng	That was money well spent.
3820633	eng	Thanks for letting me speak.
3820635	eng	We're running out of space.
3820636	eng	I don't like this soup.
3820637	eng	I really liked the soup.
3820643	eng	Tom said he wasn't sorry.
3820647	eng	You should've told me sooner.
3820650	eng	I hope to return soon.
3820651	eng	I hope you'll return soon.
3820653	eng	The show will begin soon.
3820654	eng	We hope to reopen soon.
3820655	eng	I hope to finish soon.
3820663	eng	Tom is a good songwriter.
3820665	eng	Who taught you that song?
3820666	eng	Do you remember this song?
3820671	eng	Do you like this song?
3820675	eng	This is my favorite song.
3820678	eng	Tom should write a song.
3820680	eng	I've seen the guy somewhere.
3820681	eng	I know it's there somewhere.
3820684	eng	We go out together sometimes.
3820687	eng	Did Tom ask you something?
3820692	eng	You have to buy something.
3820693	eng	Please let me say something.
3820701	eng	I think they're plotting something.
3820702	eng	That reminds us of something.
3820703	eng	I'll go and prepare something.
3820705	eng	Have you ever killed someone?
3820706	eng	I have to trust someone.
3820707	eng	It reminds me of someone.
3820708	eng	This reminds me of someone.
3820710	eng	These problems can be solved.
3820711	eng	Is there really a solution?
3820713	eng	I guess that's the solution.
3820714	eng	We're close to a solution.
3820728	eng	Did you really think so?
3820736	eng	We wanted to do so.
3820737	eng	They seemed to think so.
3820739	eng	My grandmother told me so.
3820741	eng	Don't you have a snowmobile?
3820742	eng	I don't have a snowmobile.
3820749	eng	I don't think I snore.
3820754	eng	Popcorn is my favorite snack.
3820755	eng	I made you a snack.
3820757	eng	I'm trying to quit smoking.
3820760	eng	I've never seen Tom smile.
3820763	eng	I want to become smarter.
3820764	eng	Do you think I'm smart?
3820765	eng	The world is very small.
3820779	eng	Last night, I didn't sleep.
3820783	eng	I really need to sleep.
3820787	eng	Tom stared at the sky.
3820789	eng	Tom wanted to go skiing.
3820791	eng	Let me see your sketches.
3820794	eng	I'll be there at six.
3820796	eng	I can't ignore this situation.
3820800	eng	Are you really my sister?
3820807	eng	Why are you still single?
3820811	eng	I'm not a good singer.
3820813	eng	Has Tom promised to sing?
3820815	eng	Is it really that simple?
3820816	eng	The truth is very simple.
3820818	eng	It really is that simple.
3820824	eng	Don't change lanes without signaling.
3820825	eng	Is this a bad sign?
3820834	eng	I'm tired of being sick.
3820835	eng	This music makes me sick.
3820836	eng	Are all the windows shut?
3820838	eng	It's your turn to shuffle.
3820841	eng	Was Tom in the shower?
3820858	eng	Don't forget to go shopping.
3820860	eng	Where's the nearest coffee shop?
3820863	eng	Why aren't you wearing shoes?
3820868	eng	I was a bit shocked.
3820871	eng	I like this striped shirt.
3820876	eng	Mary is pretty, isn't she?
3820879	eng	You're really in bad shape.
3820880	eng	Do you think I'm shallow?
3820887	eng	They might take you seriously.
3820894	eng	People think that I'm serious.
3820896	eng	Tom and Mary came separately.
3820901	eng	I have one to sell.
3820908	eng	What movie did you see?
3820910	eng	What was there to see?
3820911	eng	What movie should we see?
3820913	eng	We need a new secretary.
3820920	eng	You can't keep a secret.
3820921	eng	It'll take a few seconds.
3820924	eng	Will you please be seated?
3820928	eng	Why aren't you at school?
3820930	eng	Why did you skip school?
3820948	eng	Your story wasn't very scary.
3820950	eng	What color is Mary's scarf?
3820952	eng	I'm beginning to get scared.
3820953	eng	They're looking for a scapegoat.
3820955	eng	That's what the law says.
3820956	eng	That's what Tom always says.
3820957	eng	Do what your mother says.
3820965	eng	So, what do you say?
3820981	eng	What else could Tom say?
3820982	eng	What exactly did Tom say?
3820983	eng	What did the police say?
3820996	eng	Tom has something to say.
3821002	eng	Who knows what you saw?
3821005	eng	Tell me who you saw.
3821009	eng	I was more than satisfied.
3821017	eng	I only ate one sandwich.
3821019	eng	I made you a sandwich.
3821021	eng	Will you do the same?
3821022	eng	Are these all the same?
3821024	eng	Don't I look the same?
3821027	eng	Every day is the same.
3821031	eng	You don't look the same.
3821033	eng	Is it still for sale?
3821037	eng	Was that what you said?
3821045	eng	Tom knows what you said.
3821048	eng	Forget what I just said.
3821059	eng	Think about what I said.
3821060	eng	Yeah, that's what I said.
3821061	eng	I mean what I said.
3821062	eng	I meant everything I said.
3821066	eng	This car is quite safe.
3821072	eng	I think those are Tom's.
3821075	eng	I'm not a good runner.
3821077	eng	Listen, I've got to run.
3821078	eng	You should've seen Tom run.
3821080	eng	Don't ever forget this rule.
3821088	eng	I was cleaning my room.
3821101	eng	I'm in my hotel room.
3821103	eng	I want a single room.
3821104	eng	Tom has left the room.
3821107	eng	I've finished cleaning the room.
3821111	eng	Could you pass the rolls?
3821118	eng	You took some unnecessary risks.
3821119	eng	There are no health risks.
3821125	eng	I know my legal rights.
3821131	eng	You're sure about this, right?
3821133	eng	You talked to Tom, right?
3821137	eng	This time Tom is right.
3821141	eng	There's something not quite right.
3821142	eng	It doesn't seem quite right.
3821144	eng	It seems you were right.
3821149	eng	How did Tom get rich?
3821153	eng	I used to be rich.
3821156	eng	This should be completely rewritten.
3821158	eng	I got my license revoked.
3821161	eng	We'll wait for your return.
3821162	eng	Tom wanted something in return.
3821163	eng	Wait here until I return.
3821165	eng	I'm not ready to retire.
3821166	eng	I think you should retire.
3821167	eng	They sent us the results.
3821171	eng	We found a great restaurant.
3821172	eng	I've always liked this restaurant.
3821173	eng	I found a nice restaurant.
3821174	eng	Now I want to rest.
3821176	eng	Your father is very responsible.
3821181	eng	The matter has been resolved.
3821182	eng	I thought Tom had resigned.
3821187	eng	What more do you require?
3821190	eng	Tom was elected class representative.
3821191	eng	Have you seen my report?
3821192	eng	Have you read my report?
3821195	eng	I expect a detailed report.
3821198	eng	You've lied to me repeatedly.
3821203	eng	I've always paid the rent.
3821213	eng	The prisoners have been released.
3821217	eng	Tom and I are related.
3821219	eng	I think that's very regrettable.
3821221	eng	Do I have to register?
3821224	eng	Please send me a refund.
3821225	eng	Do you know any redheads?
3821229	eng	I haven't yet fully recovered.
3821231	eng	Tom has almost completely recovered.
3821233	eng	This movie is highly recommended.
3821235	eng	They arrived in Boston recently.
3821240	eng	Do I need another reason?
3821242	eng	Is that a valid reason?
3821247	eng	I've got to get ready.
3821249	eng	OK, I guess I'm ready.
3821251	eng	We must always be ready.
3821254	eng	You have to be ready.
3821256	eng	Is this book worth reading?
3821260	eng	You seem to dislike reading.
3821261	eng	Are you a mind reader?
3821262	eng	I'm not a mind reader.
3821271	eng	Let's hope it doesn't rain.
3821274	eng	It was a tough race.
3821280	eng	Maybe I should just quit.
3821282	eng	That's why we can't quit.
3821289	eng	Wow, you catch on quick.
3821290	eng	Will you answer my questions?
3821294	eng	Tom didn't ask any questions.
3821301	eng	We should've asked more questions.
3821307	eng	This is an easy question.
3821311	eng	Get back to your quarters.
3821312	eng	Go back to your quarters.
3821319	eng	Do you want a puppy?
3821323	eng	Tom has already been punished.
3821330	eng	Where was this book published?
3821331	eng	This story can't be published.
3821336	eng	This time we have proof.
3821337	eng	You don't keep your promises.
3821339	eng	Did Tom break his promise?
3821340	eng	Do I have your promise?
3821344	eng	This is my last project.
3821346	eng	Have we made any progress?
3821350	eng	I don't like this program.
3821351	eng	Tom is a real professional.
3821352	eng	I buy only organic products.
3821353	eng	Are you ready to proceed?
3821355	eng	Who's causing all the problems?
3821357	eng	I haven't noticed any problems.
3821360	eng	I have some serious problems.
3821363	eng	I think you're causing problems.
3821365	eng	Tom doesn't have these problems.
3821366	eng	Tom certainly has some problems.
3821372	eng	That was Tom's biggest problem.
3821373	eng	It's not a difficult problem.
3821375	eng	We're still discussing that problem.
3821377	eng	Let's talk about Tom's problem.
3821379	eng	This might be your problem.
3821381	eng	I have the same problem.
3821382	eng	I'm not causing the problem.
3821400	eng	You'll probably die in prison.
3821402	eng	Tom said I was pretty.
3821406	eng	People here are very prejudiced.
3821412	eng	Who taught you this prayer?
3821414	eng	See you at band practice.
3821415	eng	Tom weighs around 300 pounds.
3821420	eng	Is such a thing possible?
3821421	eng	How would that be possible?
3821422	eng	How could this be possible?
3821428	eng	I wish it were possible.
3821431	eng	You have to be positive.
3821435	eng	Who made this song popular?
3821437	eng	I feel like eating popcorn.
3821438	eng	Are we really that poor?
3821441	eng	I used to be poor.
3821445	eng	Tom isn't interested in politics.
3821446	eng	Tom is always very polite.
3821449	eng	That doesn't sound very polite.
3821451	eng	Tom wanted to be polite.
3821452	eng	We realized it was pointless.
3821459	eng	It was a real pleasure.
3821463	eng	Let's make a new playlist.
3821466	eng	Were you the bass player?
3821469	eng	Remember to water the plants.
3821470	eng	Have you made any plans?
3821473	eng	Tom didn't change his plans.
3821476	eng	We met on the plane.
3821477	eng	What's wrong with my plan?
3821478	eng	What exactly is our plan?
3821480	eng	I've already considered that plan.
3821488	eng	My family owns this place.
3821490	eng	I'll go in your place.
3821491	eng	You don't know the place.
3821500	eng	Will you have some pie?
3821504	eng	We've already published these pictures.
3821506	eng	Are you in this picture?
3821508	eng	Write something about this picture.
3821511	eng	I changed my profile picture.
3821516	eng	Who taught you the piano?
3821518	eng	I just saw your photos.
3821520	eng	I'm not a great photographer.
3821523	eng	I have to make photocopies.
3821528	eng	I sent you a photo.
3821529	eng	I have three mobile phones.
3821530	eng	Tom bought a mobile phone.
3821532	eng	Why are you so pessimistic?
3821533	eng	I know Tom Jackson personally.
3821539	eng	You're a very bad person.
3821544	eng	Don't use too much pepper.
3821545	eng	Go easy on the pepper.
3821549	eng	I still don't understand people.
3821551	eng	Tom didn't sharpen the pencils.
3821553	eng	Tom is sharpening his pencil.
3821556	eng	I need a red pen.
3821559	eng	Are you allergic to peanuts?
3821564	eng	How much would you pay?
3821565	eng	Do we have to pay?
3821567	eng	There's no need to pay.
3821573	eng	I'm ashamed of my past.
3821579	eng	Have you seen Tom's passport?
3821581	eng	I can't find my passport.
3821585	eng	Were you at the party?
3821604	eng	It's divided into three parts.
3821605	eng	Did you find a partner?
3821607	eng	Tom has done his part.
3821608	eng	This is my favorite part.
3821618	eng	Be kind to your parents.
3821620	eng	I signed the wrong paper.
3821622	eng	I just saw a panther.
3821623	eng	I just spotted a panther.
3821625	eng	Why are you so pale?
3821627	eng	I'm already in my pajamas.
3821629	eng	Tom looked at the painting.
3821633	eng	Tom couldn't hide his pain.
3821636	eng	Try to ignore the pain.
3821641	eng	How will I get paid?
3821642	eng	When will I get paid?
3821655	eng	I'll be on my own.
3821656	eng	How much do I owe?
3821657	eng	Do you think I'm overweight?
3821660	eng	I think I've been overcharged.
3821662	eng	Are you saying it's over?
3821666	eng	The wait is almost over.
3821668	eng	OK, I'll be right over.
3821674	eng	We could hear sirens outside.
3821676	eng	I heard a car outside.
3821678	eng	Is that really so outrageous?
3821679	eng	What Tom said was outrageous.
3821682	eng	Will you cut it out?
3821685	eng	What are you leaving out?
3821686	eng	Why are you going out?
3821687	eng	Have I left anything out?
3821688	eng	Did I leave anything out?
3821690	eng	How would they find out?
3821691	eng	Let's find a way out.
3821693	eng	I could've helped you out.
3821698	eng	Tom is checking things out.
3821705	eng	The truth will come out.
3821706	eng	Come and help me out.
3821712	eng	I love to help others.
3821713	eng	Do no harm to others.
3821714	eng	We must stop the others.
3821715	eng	I'd better warn the others.
3821720	eng	They can help each other.
3821725	eng	It's better than the original.
3821727	eng	We have to obey orders.
3821731	eng	It'll be a long ordeal.
3821732	eng	You look like an orangutan.
3821733	eng	My favorite color is orange.
3821734	eng	You have only two options.
3821736	eng	You have only three options.
3821743	eng	It was a lost opportunity.
3821744	eng	I've never had the opportunity.
3821745	eng	There will be new opportunities.
3821746	eng	There will be other opportunities.
3821748	eng	I don't need your opinion.
3821751	eng	That's only my personal opinion.
3821752	eng	That's my own personal opinion.
3821762	eng	I have to buy one.
3821764	eng	My favorite is this one.
3821766	eng	I don't want another one.
3821767	eng	Maybe we could take one.
3821769	eng	This is an extra one.
3821773	eng	Tom didn't answer at once.
3821779	eng	There's something mysterious going on.
3821786	eng	You have to hold on.
3821789	eng	This cabinet is very old.
3821794	eng	You make us feel old.
3821795	eng	You make me feel old.
3821796	eng	Maybe I'm just getting old.
3821801	eng	Is your family doing OK?
3821805	eng	I hope it goes OK.
3821806	eng	They tell me you're OK.
3821810	eng	I see Tom pretty often.
3821812	eng	Tom does that quite often.
3821814	eng	This list is not official.
3821827	eng	Did Tom accept your offer?
3821828	eng	Why would I be offended?
3821831	eng	Why was your phone off?
3821832	eng	Tomorrow is a day off.
3821835	eng	I'm taking this week off.
3821836	eng	Tom must've been showing off.
3821837	eng	The plane is taking off.
3821845	eng	I'll see you in October.
3821846	eng	My birthday is in October.
3821847	eng	We'll meet again in October.
3821848	eng	I'll be back in October.
3821854	eng	Are you really that oblivious?
3821857	eng	Does anyone have any objections?
3821869	eng	Three is my lucky number.
3821872	eng	Should I open it now?
3821873	eng	Are you angry right now?
3821875	eng	Where are they right now?
3821882	eng	Are you lying right now?
3821886	eng	Are you tired right now?
3821888	eng	Who wants to eat now?
3821889	eng	Who can stop us now?
3821890	eng	Where are the flowers now?
3821897	eng	Are you in Boston now?
3821899	eng	Where do you work now?
3821900	eng	Where does Tom work now?
3821902	eng	Who are you texting now?
3821903	eng	What are they doing now?
3821907	eng	What should be done now?
3821908	eng	Are you at home now?
3821909	eng	Can you come home now?
3821911	eng	Are you watching me now?
3821912	eng	Who have I offended now?
3821917	eng	Tom should be happy now.
3821918	eng	I have to study now.
3821929	eng	Tom is doing it now.
3821938	eng	We're accepting applications right now.
3821952	eng	Nothing can stop us now.
3821953	eng	We want the facts now.
3821955	eng	Your time is over now.
3821957	eng	We understand each other now.
3821961	eng	I need to go now.
3821962	eng	I want an explanation now.
3821966	eng	We'd better get going now.
3821970	eng	I could go there now.
3821975	eng	We're watching a movie now.
3821976	eng	I feel really good now.
3821980	eng	I haven't yet been notified.
3821983	eng	Should I be taking notes?
3821985	eng	Don't throw away your notes.
3821986	eng	Let me see your notes.
3821989	eng	Tom bought a new notebook.
3821997	eng	Do you understand or not?
3822010	eng	I think that's quite normal.
3822015	eng	Stop making so much noise.
3822016	eng	Try to ignore the noise.
3822017	eng	Why did you say no?
3822019	eng	I don't ever say no.
3822024	eng	What'll you do tomorrow night?
3822028	eng	Who was there last night?
3822029	eng	Were you here last night?
3822033	eng	Were you here all night?
3822035	eng	I'll be there Monday night.
3822036	eng	I'll be there Friday night.
3822038	eng	We'll be home tomorrow night.
3822041	eng	I saw you last night.
3822042	eng	I saw it last night.
3822043	eng	I bought it last night.
3822052	eng	Tom called me last night.
3822054	eng	The pain started last night.
3822059	eng	I've been driving all night.
3822061	eng	I had a bad night.
3822062	eng	I'll try to be nicer.
3822063	eng	My boss is very nice.
3822069	eng	Tom never reads the newspaper.
3822073	eng	They're listening to the news.
3822074	eng	Listen, I have good news.
3822077	eng	I don't see anything new.
3822078	eng	I didn't see anything new.
3822082	eng	I don't like my neighbors.
3822086	eng	This is a rough neighborhood.
3822087	eng	Do you hate your neighbor?
3822091	eng	They got everything they needed.
3822094	eng	How many do they need?
3822098	eng	What else will you need?
3822099	eng	How many does Tom need?
3822100	eng	What else do we need?
3822101	eng	Is this all we need?
3822105	eng	I have what you need.
3822110	eng	Maybe that's what I need.
3822112	eng	Thank you for the necklace.
3822114	eng	Is all this really necessary?
3822116	eng	Is it really that necessary?
3822117	eng	Why would it be necessary?
3822118	eng	Why would that be necessary?
3822119	eng	What we did was necessary.
3822120	eng	Tell me if it's necessary.
3822122	eng	I don't remember their names.
3822124	eng	Who told you my name?
3822137	eng	I know that sounds naive.
3822139	eng	I'm tired of your nagging.
3822141	eng	Can I do it myself?
3822150	eng	I'm very ashamed of myself.
3822153	eng	I'm kind of surprised myself.
3822161	eng	Do you like modern music?
3822163	eng	I can't live without music.
3822168	eng	Tom doesn't like loud music.
3822169	eng	Tom can't stand loud music.
3822176	eng	I loved Tom very much.
3822177	eng	Thank you all very much.
3822187	eng	Please don't complain so much.
3822192	eng	Maybe I expect too much.
3822205	eng	I've just seen that movie.
3822214	eng	Let's go see a movie.
3822218	eng	I like to ride motorcycles.
3822224	eng	Tom didn't like his mother.
3822226	eng	What do you want most?
3822232	eng	Tom died early Monday morning.
3822235	eng	It was sunny this morning.
3822241	eng	I noticed that this morning.
3822246	eng	I shoveled snow all morning.
3822248	eng	You've been waiting all morning.
3822254	eng	Tom didn't say any more.
3822255	eng	We can't say any more.
3822257	eng	I can't sleep any more.
3822258	eng	I can't walk any more.
3822259	eng	We can't have any more.
3822260	eng	Let me tell you more.
3822262	eng	I expected a bit more.
3822263	eng	I want to get more.
3822266	eng	We need to train more.
3822267	eng	I won't say anything more.
3822268	eng	Don't ask for anything more.
3822279	eng	I'll know in three months.
3822280	eng	See you in three months.
3822292	eng	Help me hide this money.
3822295	eng	I won't accept your money.
3822296	eng	You're always wasting your money.
3822321	eng	You should've taken the money.
3822327	eng	Where were you last Monday?
3822329	eng	Do you work on Monday?
3822331	eng	Can you stay till Monday?
3822338	eng	I'll do that next Monday.
3822342	eng	You're lucky it's not Monday.
3822344	eng	I thought it was Monday.
3822354	eng	I don't work on Monday.
3822357	eng	I'll be there on Monday.
3822361	eng	I'll get home on Monday.
3822368	eng	Could you spare a moment?
3822370	eng	Excuse me just a moment.
3822379	eng	This is just a misunderstanding.
3822380	eng	I made very few mistakes.
3822395	eng	This is a suicide mission.
3822397	eng	One box is still missing.
3822398	eng	One crate is still missing.
3822403	eng	We've only got thirty minutes.
3822409	eng	Give me five more minutes.
3822415	eng	I'll just be a minute.
3822425	eng	Did you change your mind?
3822429	eng	That totally slipped my mind.
3822431	eng	Always keep that in mind.
3822432	eng	I have an open mind.
3822436	eng	I accidentally spilled the milk.
3822439	eng	Did you leave a message?
3822440	eng	Should I leave a message?
3822444	eng	I sent you a message.
3822445	eng	I'll send you a message.
3822446	eng	Someone left me a message.
3822449	eng	I know it's a mess.
3822455	eng	Do you date younger men?
3822474	eng	Where did you first meet?
3822477	eng	When did you two meet?
3822487	eng	Tom doesn't have the measles.
3822489	eng	Tom understood what Mary meant.
3822490	eng	Tom wondered what Mary meant.
3822491	eng	Yeah, that's what I meant.
3822493	eng	I know what that means.
3822495	eng	So, what do you mean?
3822496	eng	What else could it mean?
3822497	eng	Say what you really mean.
3822498	eng	Oh, that's what you mean.
3822501	eng	When was your last meal?
3822513	eng	Why do you resent me?
3822515	eng	Why didn't you protect me?
3822517	eng	How does that affect me?
3822518	eng	Why would you doubt me?
3822521	eng	Why would anybody kiss me?
3822530	eng	Were you looking for me?
3822531	eng	What've you done for me?
3822532	eng	Tom, do you hear me?
3822533	eng	Tom, can you hear me?
3822539	eng	Were you listening to me?
3822540	eng	Did you lie to me?
3822542	eng	Have you lied to me?
3822544	eng	How does this concern me?
3822546	eng	Did you just threaten me?
3822549	eng	Are you stealing from me?
3822553	eng	Why wouldn't Tom call me?
3822555	eng	Why did you ask me?
3822557	eng	Why would Tom attack me?
3822560	eng	Are you playing with me?
3822561	eng	Are you messing with me?
3822564	eng	What could you teach me?
3822565	eng	Why are you insulting me?
3822566	eng	Why are you fighting me?
3822567	eng	Have you been calling me?
3822568	eng	Why aren't you asking me?
3822569	eng	Why are you thanking me?
3822571	eng	Have you been watching me?
3822574	eng	How did you recognize me?
3822575	eng	Why can't you forgive me?
3822576	eng	Could you ever forgive me?
3822577	eng	Why did you leave me?
3822579	eng	Would you all excuse me?
3822582	eng	What made you blame me?
3822586	eng	Now you really worry me.
3822594	eng	Don't hold it against me.
3822595	eng	Try not to disappoint me.
3822601	eng	Don't try and protect me.
3822604	eng	No one ever visits me.
3822606	eng	I hope Tom helps me.
3822616	eng	Get a ticket for me.
3822625	eng	You're too good for me.
3822630	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't remember me.
3822631	eng	You obviously don't remember me.
3822632	eng	My sister didn't help me.
3822639	eng	Tom tried to help me.
3822640	eng	Perhaps you can help me.
3822642	eng	Stay here and help me.
3822643	eng	It seemed funny to me.
3822644	eng	This is important to me.
3822645	eng	It seems obvious to me.
3822648	eng	Now it's up to me.
3822651	eng	You don't listen to me.
3822652	eng	Tom has spoken to me.
3822654	eng	It looks beautiful to me.
3822655	eng	You're very special to me.
3822657	eng	It seems logical to me.
3822658	eng	It seemed logical to me.
3822661	eng	Don't compare yourself to me.
3822664	eng	That's not acceptable to me.
3822665	eng	That sounds reasonable to me.
3822666	eng	You always lie to me.
3822668	eng	Life's been good to me.
3822675	eng	Just stay away from me.
3822676	eng	Please get away from me.
3822678	eng	You tried to kill me.
3822680	eng	I'll take you with me.
3822681	eng	Share your secret with me.
3822682	eng	Someone else was with me.
3822683	eng	Come have dinner with me.
3822689	eng	Please be frank with me.
3822692	eng	I have one with me.
3822693	eng	Please come home with me.
3822694	eng	No one came with me.
3822695	eng	Don't try to catch me.
3822696	eng	Thank you for supporting me.
3822697	eng	Thank you for accepting me.
3822698	eng	Thank you for meeting me.
3822702	eng	This man is harassing me.
3822704	eng	Thank you for warning me.
3822705	eng	Thank you for calling me.
3822710	eng	You don't really love me.
3822714	eng	Tom tried to deceive me.
3822715	eng	I know you believe me.
3822725	eng	Tom seems to hate me.
3822728	eng	I hope you like me.
3822729	eng	I'm glad you like me.
3822730	eng	Tom still doesn't like me.
3822735	eng	Sit down here beside me.
3822737	eng	Don't try to bribe me.
3822740	eng	Lock this door behind me.
3822741	eng	Lock the door behind me.
3822749	eng	Tom's singing really impressed me.
3822754	eng	Both of them hugged me.
3822756	eng	They tried to rob me.
3822758	eng	How could it not matter?
3822759	eng	Is this a serious matter?
3822761	eng	My favorite subject is math.
3822765	eng	Did you propose to Mary?
3822770	eng	I wanted to marry Mary.
3822772	eng	Tom seemed to know Mary.
3822776	eng	Tom said nothing about Mary.
3822783	eng	Tom keeps looking at Mary.
3822812	eng	Tom didn't talk to Mary.
3822813	eng	Tom couldn't speak to Mary.
3822823	eng	Tom is richer than Mary.
3822844	eng	Have Tom check with Mary.
3822845	eng	Tom liked being with Mary.
3822855	eng	Tom tried to deceive Mary.
3822859	eng	That girl looks like Mary.
3822879	eng	Let me check the manual.
3822883	eng	Are you the bank manager?
3822884	eng	Tom is now the manager.
3822889	eng	Tom is a dangerous man.
3822904	eng	Tom behaved like a lunatic.
3822916	eng	I don't deserve your love.
3822920	eng	I'll miss you a lot.
3822921	eng	This backpack cost a lot.
3822922	eng	I appreciate it a lot.
3822923	eng	I recommend it a lot.
3822925	eng	I admire Tom a lot.
3822926	eng	You owe me a lot.
3822927	eng	You've helped me a lot.
3822934	eng	It was a great loss.
3822938	eng	What else can I lose?
3822939	eng	Of course, I always lose.
3822941	eng	We're probably going to lose.
3822942	eng	They were going to lose.
3822944	eng	Do you think I'm good-looking?
3822946	eng	Do you consider yourself good-looking?
3822949	eng	We can't stay any longer.
3822950	eng	I couldn't wait any longer.
3822963	eng	We didn't wait that long.
3822966	eng	It won't seem so long.
3822967	eng	It'll take you too long.
3822969	eng	The meeting was too long.
3822970	eng	The movie was too long.
3822980	eng	Are all the windows locked?
3822981	eng	Are the windows all locked?
3822989	eng	Tom knew where Mary lived.
3823007	eng	Who's next on your list?
3823010	eng	Do you want a list?
3823011	eng	You're not on my list.
3823012	eng	I'll send you the list.
3823016	eng	My French is very limited.
3823019	eng	What bands do you like?
3823021	eng	What does it smell like?
3823022	eng	What does it taste like?
3823023	eng	What does it sound like?
3823036	eng	I'm bored with my life.
3823046	eng	I don't want to lie.
3823056	eng	What we need is leverage.
3823060	eng	I'll write you a letter.
3823064	eng	Thank you for the lesson.
3823065	eng	I'm not always so lenient.
3823066	eng	Did you shave your legs?
3823069	eng	How much money is left?
3823071	eng	Is that why Tom left?
3823076	eng	Please exit on your left.
3823088	eng	Nothing's preventing you from leaving.
3823090	eng	How soon can you leave?
3823096	eng	Isn't it time to leave?
3823098	eng	Maybe you should just leave.
3823099	eng	Maybe we should just leave.
3823104	eng	Obviously, it's time to leave.
3823105	eng	Of course, you can leave.
3823107	eng	They said I could leave.
3823113	eng	There's so much to learn.
3823114	eng	There's still much to learn.
3823116	eng	There's always more to learn.
3823129	eng	I don't like to laugh.
3823130	eng	I've never seen Tom laugh.
3823136	eng	I can tell you later.
3823138	eng	We'll deal with it later.
3823139	eng	I'll pay for this later.
3823144	eng	I'll answer my email later.
3823145	eng	I'd prefer to talk later.
3823147	eng	I've been very happy lately.
3823173	eng	I'm sorry to be late.
3823179	eng	I knew you'd be late.
3823184	eng	When were you here last?
3823186	eng	Tom's family isn't very large.
3823187	eng	This room is very large.
3823191	eng	Who are these young ladies?
3823192	eng	Go back to the laboratory.
3823195	eng	I think that's common knowledge.
3823198	eng	What exactly do you know?
3823218	eng	You must tighten the knot.
3823220	eng	Do you have a knife?
3823225	eng	Your lips look very kissable.
3823229	eng	Did you see the kids?
3823232	eng	I hate working with kids.
3823238	eng	You look like a kid.
3823240	eng	I look like a kid.
3823241	eng	Has anyone seen my keys?
3823252	eng	This time I'm not joking.
3823254	eng	Of course I was joking.
3823256	eng	You've got to be joking!
3823258	eng	Tom got all the jokes.
3823260	eng	They didn't understand your joke.
3823261	eng	Tom didn't understand your joke.
3823263	eng	I didn't understand your joke.
3823264	eng	I didn't understand the joke.
3823265	eng	Tell me that's a joke.
3823266	eng	That sounds like a joke.
3823284	eng	I wouldn't accept that job.
3823286	eng	Tom can't do this job.
3823287	eng	I can't do this job.
3823290	eng	They offered me your job.
3823293	eng	Tom got me the job.
3823294	eng	They offered me the job.
3823295	eng	You did a bad job.
3823297	eng	Tom already has a job.
3823298	eng	I haven't found a job.
3823303	eng	I'm beginning to get jealous.
3823305	eng	You should be in jail.
3823306	eng	Mary's maiden name is Jackson.
3823307	eng	How will you fix it?
3823308	eng	How would you fix it?
3823316	eng	What's so good about it?
3823319	eng	That's from Tom, isn't it?
3823326	eng	It's not true, is it?
3823329	eng	How would you repair it?
3823330	eng	Why can't they do it?
3823331	eng	Why do they do it?
3823335	eng	Who's going to do it?
3823345	eng	Why aren't you using it?
3823346	eng	Why did you bring it?
3823347	eng	Why are you doing it?
3823349	eng	How are you managing it?
3823350	eng	Why were you reading it?
3823352	eng	Do you really believe it?
3823353	eng	How did you measure it?
3823354	eng	How did you handle it?
3823356	eng	Where can I find it?
3823357	eng	Did you really understand it?
3823358	eng	Why would you need it?
3823361	eng	I have to try it.
3823362	eng	Maybe you should try it.
3823363	eng	It's useless to deny it.
3823364	eng	Go on and say it.
3823368	eng	I'm so sorry about it.
3823371	eng	I didn't know about it.
3823381	eng	They're still thinking about it.
3823390	eng	I knew you'd get it.
3823392	eng	I'm beginning to doubt it.
3823395	eng	I'm not good at it.
3823397	eng	You shouldn't even consider it.
3823398	eng	Next time, don't drop it.
3823403	eng	We should really do it.
3823405	eng	I'll try to do it.
3823415	eng	We have to do it.
3823422	eng	Go ahead and do it.
3823425	eng	I never could do it.
3823429	eng	I'll continue working on it.
3823430	eng	Look, I can't explain it.
3823436	eng	You obviously haven't seen it.
3823440	eng	I think it's worth it.
3823442	eng	I forgot to watch it.
3823444	eng	Sorry, I can't reach it.
3823445	eng	Of course, I'm denying it.
3823448	eng	I'm quite sure of it.
3823450	eng	I've never heard of it.
3823452	eng	Actually, I did write it.
3823455	eng	I'm trying to ignore it.
3823456	eng	I wanted to share it.
3823460	eng	I think I like it.
3823461	eng	Maybe we can make it.
3823462	eng	I have to change it.
3823463	eng	We want to see it.
3823466	eng	I can't even pronounce it.
3823468	eng	Unfortunately, I can't find it.
3823470	eng	I really can't understand it.
3823471	eng	I'm trying to understand it.
3823485	eng	I want to read it.
3823486	eng	I'd like to read it.
3823488	eng	Racism is a serious issue.
3823489	eng	This is a sensitive issue.
3823522	eng	How was your job interview?
3823523	eng	It was a great interview.
3823525	eng	I don't want to intervene.
3823527	eng	We communicate through an interpreter.
3823529	eng	I don't want to interfere.
3823530	eng	Do you find that interesting?
3823539	eng	I'm sure you'll be interested.
3823542	eng	What did you do instead?
3823543	eng	What should I do instead?
3823544	eng	What do you propose instead?
3823546	eng	Do you suffer from insomnia?
3823548	eng	Would you come back inside?
3823551	eng	Fortunately, no one was injured.
3823552	eng	Tom has apparently been injured.
3823556	eng	All we want is information.
3823558	eng	This is very good indeed.
3823568	eng	What hospital is Tom in?
3823575	eng	You shouldn't let Tom in.
3823586	eng	So far, I'm not impressed.
3823589	eng	It's unlikely, but not impossible.
3823593	eng	We can't do the impossible.
3823594	eng	How could that be important?
3823598	eng	Tom didn't say anything important.
3823600	eng	I started to become impatient.
3823602	eng	I thought of you immediately.
3823605	eng	Get in the car immediately.
3823607	eng	I knew you'd understand immediately.
3823608	eng	Tom should be fired immediately.
3823612	eng	Are you a complete idiot?
3823617	eng	What's wrong with my idea?
3823618	eng	Does anyone have an idea?
3823624	eng	I've already considered that idea.
3823625	eng	This trip was your idea.
3823626	eng	It's really a nice idea.
3823633	eng	It wasn't a bad idea.
3823649	eng	I hope nobody gets hurt.
3823652	eng	Do I need to hurry?
3823653	eng	I won't make you hurry.
3823661	eng	Tom didn't seem very hungry.
3823679	eng	Come over to my house.
3823680	eng	It's close to my house.
3823685	eng	I went to Tom's house.
3823687	eng	Let's go to your house.
3823688	eng	I'll come to your house.
3823693	eng	I remember this old house.
3823698	eng	Our conversation lasted for hours.
3823699	eng	We all work long hours.
3823702	eng	Tom waited for three hours.
3823712	eng	Aren't you a little hot?
3823718	eng	We'll be at the hospital.
3823722	eng	Take me to the hospital.
3823728	eng	People here are very hospitable.
3823732	eng	I still want a horse.
3823735	eng	I'm beginning to lose hope.
3823741	eng	I heard a horn honking.
3823745	eng	Are you doing your homework?
3823747	eng	I've already done my homework.
3823756	eng	Don't copy other students' homework.
3823759	eng	Can I walk you home?
3823760	eng	Shall I walk you home?
3823765	eng	What are you doing home?
3823766	eng	Could you take me home?
3823768	eng	It's close to my home.
3823775	eng	I can't take it home.
3823777	eng	Tonight, I'll stay at home.
3823778	eng	I have it at home.
3823781	eng	My mother is at home.
3823782	eng	We made ourselves at home.
3823786	eng	Luckily, you were at home.
3823790	eng	Maybe you should go home.
3823791	eng	Maybe we should go home.
3823792	eng	This is a beautiful home.
3823793	eng	Let's send them all home.
3823799	eng	They were going back home.
3823803	eng	My mother finally came home.
3823805	eng	Please just take me home.
3823811	eng	It's one of my hobbies.
3823812	eng	It was definitely a hoax.
3823869	eng	Is there something you're hiding?
3823870	eng	Are you going to hide?
3823873	eng	Tom has something to hide.
3823874	eng	Tom had something to hide.
3823875	eng	You don't have to hide.
3823879	eng	When were you last here?
3823881	eng	What do we want here?
3823890	eng	Is the zoo near here?
3823891	eng	Is your house near here?
3823894	eng	What brings you down here?
3823901	eng	Who else knows I'm here?
3823902	eng	Why are they still here?
3823907	eng	Why are you waiting here?
3823908	eng	What's that bucket doing here?
3823909	eng	Do you like working here?
3823910	eng	Why are you standing here?
3823913	eng	Why would I leave here?
3823914	eng	Do you know someone here?
3823915	eng	Why do they come here?
3823916	eng	Why can't you come here?
3823917	eng	Don't you want me here?
3823920	eng	Could you help me here?
3823924	eng	Are there bears around here?
3823934	eng	Maybe I shouldn't stay here.
3823939	eng	They know we're out here.
3823945	eng	We can't do that here.
3823949	eng	It almost never snows here.
3823951	eng	They won't find us here.
3823953	eng	We can't leave this here.
3823955	eng	All my stuff is here.
3823967	eng	Tom didn't graduate from here.
3823969	eng	You know why I'm here.
3823973	eng	We're trying to work here.
3823977	eng	I want to move here.
3823978	eng	You have to live here.
3823983	eng	Tom doesn't know we're here.
3823990	eng	It's my first time here.
3824007	eng	Tom shouldn't even be here.
3824008	eng	They could still be here.
3824009	eng	Tom could still be here.
3824027	eng	How can I be helpful?
3824042	eng	Are you offering to help?
3824044	eng	Were you able to help?
3824047	eng	I'm sorry I can't help.
3824048	eng	This time, I can't help.
3824051	eng	Listen, I need your help.
3824054	eng	Look, you've got to help.
3824068	eng	Maybe you'd like to help.
3824069	eng	Tom didn't agree to help.
3824072	eng	I think I can help.
3824075	eng	Maybe you'll need more help.
3824079	eng	I suppose I could help.
3824082	eng	I hardly ever need help.
3824083	eng	Tom said that he'd help.
3824089	eng	Tom complained about the heat.
3824091	eng	Did Tom break your heart?
3824098	eng	Have you seen the headlines?
3824101	eng	Maybe I'll shave my head.
3824110	eng	What advantage do they have?
3824111	eng	What flavors do you have?
3824112	eng	What ideas do you have?
3824113	eng	What choice do you have?
3824116	eng	What choice did we have?
3824118	eng	Give us everything you have.
3824126	eng	Tom can't find his hat.
3824131	eng	We should really try harder.
3824133	eng	Next time, I'll try harder.
3824135	eng	I need to study harder.
3824143	eng	Why should I work hard?
3824145	eng	I think it's really hard.
3824147	eng	I'm ready to work hard.
3824148	eng	I promise to work hard.
3824149	eng	I know it'll be hard.
3824153	eng	Are you still not happy?
3824154	eng	Are you really that happy?
3824156	eng	You've made me very happy.
3824160	eng	I knew Tom wasn't happy.
3824163	eng	I thought Tom was happy.
3824167	eng	That won't make Tom happy.
3824170	eng	That won't make me happy.
3824174	eng	I want to be happy.
3824176	eng	The boys will be happy.
3824177	eng	My parents will be happy.
3824178	eng	I hope you'll be happy.
3824189	eng	Tom didn't anticipate that happening.
3824199	eng	Don't you remember what happened?
3824200	eng	Can I ask what happened?
3824202	eng	I think that's already happened.
3824203	eng	Tom saw exactly what happened.
3824207	eng	Stop talking about what happened.
3824226	eng	What was about to happen?
3824232	eng	I've never seen that happen.
3824244	eng	We all know what'll happen.
3824255	eng	We're going to play handball.
3824256	eng	Do you want a hand?
3824259	eng	Show me your right hand.
3824260	eng	Hold out your left hand.
3824264	eng	Don't run in the hallways.
3824265	eng	I was in the hallway.
3824269	eng	Did you notice Tom's hair?
3824270	eng	Have you dyed your hair?
3824272	eng	Tom still has wet hair.
3824276	eng	I'll wait in the gym.
3824281	eng	Wow, you're a lucky guy.
3824284	eng	I don't like that guy.
3824285	eng	Tom is a dangerous guy.
3824286	eng	Tom was a helpful guy.
3824292	eng	Can you use a gun?
3824293	eng	It could've been a gun.
3824303	eng	Do you ever feel guilty?
3824308	eng	Of course, I feel guilty.
3824309	eng	Don't forget that you're guilty.
3824311	eng	We don't like unexpected guests.
3824313	eng	That was only a guess.
3824317	eng	Tom pointed to the ground.
3824318	eng	Do you know the groom?
3824320	eng	Why are people so greedy?
3824323	eng	That would be really great.
3824328	eng	Stop taking things for granted.
3824329	eng	You sound like my grandmother.
3824334	eng	The changes have been gradual.
3824337	eng	Was it really that good?
3824338	eng	Did I miss anything good?
3824341	eng	Your French is very good.
3824344	eng	This coffee is really good.
3824345	eng	This band is really good.
3824350	eng	Your new guitar sounds good.
3824352	eng	Unfortunately, they aren't so good.
3824354	eng	My health has been good.
3824356	eng	The weather is looking good.
3824365	eng	Now where are you going?
3824366	eng	How is your summer going?
3824367	eng	Well, I should get going.
3824371	eng	Well, I should be going.
3824373	eng	Let's see how it goes.
3824374	eng	Tom scored the first goal.
3824375	eng	How far did you go?
3824387	eng	Where does this trail go?
3824388	eng	How did the rehearsal go?
3824392	eng	Maybe you should just go.
3824393	eng	Maybe we should just go.
3824401	eng	I can't wait to go.
3824403	eng	I told Tom to go.
3824406	eng	Everyone is free to go.
3824416	eng	Did you find your gloves?
3824417	eng	Why would I need gloves?
3824418	eng	Have you seen my glasses?
3824419	eng	Has anyone seen my glasses?
3824420	eng	Do you usually wear glasses?
3824424	eng	Let me refill your glass.
3824437	eng	I brought you a gift.
3824440	eng	What more will I get?
3824447	eng	This is a volatile gas.
3824449	eng	We walked around the garden.
3824454	eng	Do you know this game?
3824457	eng	Are you watching the game?
3824458	eng	Tom played a great game.
3824460	eng	Let me finish this game.
3824462	eng	I'm tired of this game.
3824463	eng	Tom gave me this game.
3824464	eng	This is a rough game.
3824465	eng	Dominos is my favorite game.
3824468	eng	Stop talking about the game.
3824469	eng	We're ready for the game.
3824473	eng	We'll plan for the future.
3824474	eng	Let's go a little further.
3824480	eng	Try to have some fun.
3824484	eng	What are you running from?
3824485	eng	Who are you running from?
3824487	eng	Where's that smell coming from?
3824488	eng	Who are you hiding from?
3824493	eng	Did you make any friends?
3824495	eng	When did you become friends?
3824496	eng	Why can't we be friends?
3824497	eng	Are you three good friends?
3824499	eng	I miss all my friends.
3824501	eng	I enjoy making new friends.
3824508	eng	I guess we'll be friends.
3824512	eng	We're all still good friends.
3824518	eng	I was never your friend.
3824519	eng	I'll never be your friend.
3824525	eng	Do you know any French?
3824530	eng	Are you still studying French?
3824532	eng	Could you teach me French?
3824536	eng	I wanted to study French.
3824537	eng	None of them know French.
3824540	eng	Tom isn't good at French.
3824541	eng	I think Tom knows French.
3824542	eng	My favorite subject is French.
3824544	eng	I've started to learn French.
3824550	eng	Most of it's in French.
3824551	eng	It's not written in French.
3824553	eng	Tom taught his children French.
3824555	eng	Tom taught Mary's children French.
3824556	eng	You speak very beautiful French.
3824569	eng	I've already started studying French.
3824570	eng	I've just started studying French.
3824571	eng	I've just started learning French.
3824587	eng	What else have you found?
3824588	eng	Has a solution been found?
3824591	eng	A solution must be found.
3824593	eng	How could I have forgotten?
3824594	eng	Some things are never forgotten.
3824595	eng	Some things can't be forgotten.
3824596	eng	Tom has recently become forgetful.
3824598	eng	We explored the Amazon forest.
3824605	eng	So, what're you waiting for?
3824606	eng	What was Tom waiting for?
3824607	eng	What are they asking for?
3824608	eng	Who were you looking for?
3824609	eng	What are we looking for?
3824611	eng	Who will you vote for?
3824612	eng	What was Tom there for?
3824633	eng	Are you interested in football?
3824634	eng	I'm not interested in football.
3824635	eng	Tom insisted on watching football.
3824636	eng	Maybe I'm just a fool.
3824639	eng	You shouldn't eat fatty foods.
3824640	eng	Do we have any food?
3824648	eng	We'll bring plenty of food.
3824649	eng	We'll have plenty of food.
3824650	eng	We have plenty of food.
3824654	eng	I dreamed I was flying.
3824656	eng	I've watered all the flowers.
3824658	eng	There are no quick fixes.
3824662	eng	Tom and Mary went fishing.
3824664	eng	I didn't catch any fish.
3824670	eng	I hated it at first.
3824671	eng	We need a publisher first.
3824680	eng	Your car is on fire.
3824685	eng	I'll wait until you've finished.
3824687	eng	I can't wait to finish.
3824692	eng	Your baby is doing fine.
3824694	eng	What problems did you find?
3824701	eng	Why are we still fighting?
3824703	eng	Get back here and fight.
3824704	eng	I've never lost a fight.
3824706	eng	Tom likes to read fiction.
3824722	eng	It's one of my favorites.
3824727	eng	It was totally my fault.
3824729	eng	It was probably my fault.
3824732	eng	Maybe it wasn't my fault.
3824733	eng	It probably is my fault.
3824739	eng	That was Tom's own fault.
3824742	eng	I've always respected my father.
3824745	eng	I'm afraid of your father.
3824747	eng	The snake bite was fatal.
3824757	eng	They can't have gone far.
3824769	eng	Don't worry about your family.
3824771	eng	You're part of the family.
3824772	eng	I already have a family.
3824773	eng	Go back to your families.
3824774	eng	Why do you look familiar?
3824793	eng	What's that on your face?
3824796	eng	Let's talk face to face.
3824797	eng	Tom has a nice face.
3824798	eng	The light hurts my eyes.
3824800	eng	Come on, close your eyes.
3824805	eng	How could it have exploded?
3824810	eng	Give me a reasonable explanation.
3824815	eng	Look, I'm not an expert.
3824816	eng	I know it's an experiment.
3824817	eng	Tom talked about his experiences.
3824819	eng	Do you have any experience?
3824823	eng	This car is too expensive.
3824825	eng	I know it'll be expensive.
3824830	eng	It's not what I expected.
3824836	eng	What else can you expect?
3824837	eng	What else should we expect?
3824840	eng	I think you look exhausted.
3824841	eng	I hurt myself while exercising.
3824848	eng	Tom got a little excited.
3824854	eng	Wait till I finish exams.
3824856	eng	Could you give an example?
3824866	eng	What do you mean exactly?
3824867	eng	What do you need exactly?
3824869	eng	Do you have any evidence?
3824870	eng	Didn't you find any evidence?
3824872	eng	English is spoken almost everywhere.
3824874	eng	Did you really eat everything?
3824880	eng	Now I'll tell you everything.
3824881	eng	I've already told you everything.
3824882	eng	Tom always worries about everything.
3824883	eng	I'll try to forget everything.
3824888	eng	They have time for everything.
3824890	eng	I'll help you burn everything.
3824893	eng	I want to break everything.
3824894	eng	Thank you for explaining everything.
3824895	eng	You've really thought of everything.
3824897	eng	You must tell me everything.
3824900	eng	I think I've understood everything.
3824905	eng	You have to read everything.
3824907	eng	I want to impress everyone.
3824908	eng	I've made dinner for everyone.
3824910	eng	They do that to everyone.
3824911	eng	I want to tell everyone.
3824915	eng	You're as beautiful as ever.
3824916	eng	We eat together every evening.
3824918	eng	It was a great evening.
3824919	eng	We must leave this evening.
3824920	eng	It was a beautiful evening.
3824921	eng	Thank you for the evening.
3824923	eng	Are you trying to escape?
3824924	eng	Don't let these snakes escape.
3824927	eng	Can I use this eraser?
3824929	eng	I don't like this episode.
3824935	eng	We have more than enough.
3824940	eng	Tom was an electrical engineer.
3824943	eng	I don't have any energy.
3824946	eng	I know how it ends.
3824947	eng	Let's see how it ends.
3824952	eng	The coffee pot is empty.
3824953	eng	The gas tank is empty.
3824954	eng	Tom sometimes gets too emotional.
3824956	eng	This is a medical emergency.
3824961	eng	I think Tom was embarrassed.
3824963	eng	Do you do anything else?
3824964	eng	Do we have anything else?
3824967	eng	Have you met anyone else?
3824968	eng	You can't say anything else.
3824972	eng	I'm looking for something else.
3824973	eng	You should do something else.
3824978	eng	You're just like everyone else.
3824980	eng	Don't be like everyone else.
3824981	eng	I'm looking for someone else.
3824987	eng	I can't see it either.
3824989	eng	I don't see anything either.
3824990	eng	I couldn't believe it, either.
3824991	eng	I didn't believe it, either.
3824992	eng	Tom doesn't like it, either.
3824993	eng	I'm not enjoying this, either.
3825001	eng	I don't want to eat.
3825009	eng	The exam was very easy.
3825014	eng	It would be too easy.
3825016	eng	Don't give up so easily.
3825029	eng	Actually, we're a little early.
3825035	eng	Does that mean I'm dying?
3825039	eng	My throat's a little dry.
3825046	eng	We'll all soon be drunk.
3825048	eng	I never use illegal drugs.
3825053	eng	Tom wants you to drive.
3825054	eng	I need you to drive.
3825057	eng	I have to stop drinking.
3825058	eng	Do you want to drink?
3825064	eng	We have to get dressed.
3825066	eng	What size is that dress?
3825067	eng	I don't like that dress.
3825068	eng	Tell me I'm not dreaming.
3825074	eng	Look in your top drawer.
3825077	eng	Do you like to draw?
3825078	eng	What conclusions can we draw?
3825080	eng	Why don't we go downstairs?
3825081	eng	Should I write that down?
3825082	eng	Why are we slowing down?
3825084	eng	Maybe I should slow down.
3825085	eng	Let's go and sit down.
3825086	eng	I'd better write that down.
3825088	eng	Does anyone still have doubts?
3825089	eng	I never had any doubts.
3825091	eng	I'm beginning to have doubts.
3825093	eng	Tom sat on the doorstep.
3825095	eng	Did you shut the door?
3825110	eng	What else have you done?
3825114	eng	What should we have done?
3825117	eng	My work here is done.
3825122	eng	Now look what you've done.
3825123	eng	Now look what I've done.
3825141	eng	What were you really doing?
3825142	eng	What are you girls doing?
3825143	eng	What are you kids doing?
3825144	eng	What are your kids doing?
3825167	eng	Are you afraid of dogs?
3825168	eng	I often eat hot dogs.
3825169	eng	Do you want this dog?
3825173	eng	Tom has a white dog.
3825177	eng	I don't want a dog.
3825180	eng	Did you call the doctor?
3825181	eng	Should I call the doctor?
3825183	eng	Tom went to the doctor.
3825184	eng	I went to the doctor.
3825188	eng	So, what would you do?
3825213	eng	What does this button do?
3825215	eng	What else could Tom do?
3825218	eng	What does that thing do?
3825219	eng	What more can I do?
3825223	eng	Be careful what you do.
3825257	eng	There's nothing better to do.
3825296	eng	Look what I can do.
3825298	eng	Tell me what you'll do.
3825299	eng	Yeah, that's what I'll do.
3825306	eng	Yeah, that's what I'd do.
3825316	eng	Tom is washing the dishes.
3825330	eng	I've had too many disappointments.
3825331	eng	It was a huge disappointment.
3825335	eng	Who became the new director?
3825337	eng	All I want is directions.
3825342	eng	Why aren't you cooking dinner?
3825345	eng	It's almost time for dinner.
3825350	eng	The exam was very difficult.
3825351	eng	Getting started is always difficult.
3825354	eng	I know it'll be difficult.
3825359	eng	We were expecting something different.
3825363	eng	Without you, I would've died.
3825364	eng	Aren't you afraid to die?
3825374	eng	Think about what you did.
3825396	eng	Everyone gets what they deserve.
3825398	eng	Tom's story was very depressing.
3825405	eng	This peanut butter is delicious.
3825409	eng	The train has been delayed.
3825410	eng	It looks like a deer.
3825415	eng	We'll make the right decision.
3825417	eng	I made the right decision.
3825419	eng	I've just made a decision.
3825423	eng	I don't have any debt.
3825424	eng	Tom was beaten to death.
3825429	eng	It was a huge deal.
3825433	eng	I'm glad Tom isn't dead.
3825435	eng	Both my parents are dead.
3825443	eng	Wait a few more days.
3825447	eng	Did you sleep all day?
3825450	eng	Learn something new every day.
3825455	eng	Tomorrow is a new day.
3825456	eng	I was there that day.
3825460	eng	I've been busy all day.
3825462	eng	I did nothing all day.
3825465	eng	I've been here all day.
3825468	eng	I was detained all day.
3825469	eng	Yesterday, I studied all day.
3825470	eng	It's been a tough day.
3825471	eng	It'll be a long day.
3825472	eng	Tomorrow is the big day.
3825476	eng	Today wasn't a good day.
3825479	eng	What happened to your daughter?
3825485	eng	I don't trust this data.
3825487	eng	Some women are very dangerous.
3825488	eng	Tonight, let's all go dancing.
3825489	eng	I don't like square dancing.
3825491	eng	Would you care to dance?
3825493	eng	I just want to dance.
3825496	eng	Do you think I'm cynical?
3825497	eng	I thought it was cute.
3825499	eng	Go get your hair cut.
3825506	eng	It sounds like someone's crying.
3825510	eng	I almost started to cry.
3825512	eng	The movie made me cry.
3825513	eng	We met on a cruise.
3825519	eng	I think they're all criminals.
3825521	eng	It's a very serious crime.
3825523	eng	Tom's body will be cremated.
3825529	eng	Let's stop for ice cream.
3825530	eng	I want an ice cream.
3825531	eng	I want some ice cream.
3825532	eng	Are you saying I'm crazy?
3825540	eng	How old are your cousins?
3825546	eng	They live in another country.
3825548	eng	Australia is an amazing country.
3825552	eng	They did all they could.
3825559	eng	Tom answered the question correctly.
3825562	eng	I'm not afraid of cops.
3825564	eng	I'm afraid of the cops.
3825576	eng	Tom still isn't quite convinced.
3825580	eng	Please don't sign the contract.
3825594	eng	Thank you for your confidence.
3825600	eng	I'll be brief and concise.
3825603	eng	I was at Tom's concert.
3825610	eng	Do you understand the concept?
3825611	eng	Let me use your computer.
3825613	eng	Tom seems unwilling to compromise.
3825616	eng	Is it really so complicated?
3825617	eng	Why is love so complicated?
3825621	eng	I don't trust you completely.
3825622	eng	Don't rule it out completely.
3825624	eng	Why are you always complaining?
3825625	eng	Why are you still complaining?
3825629	eng	Do you wish to complain?
3825634	eng	Can I keep you company?
3825635	eng	Who would keep me company?
3825636	eng	I can keep you company.
3825637	eng	I'll come to your company.
3825640	eng	Unfortunately, I had another commitment.
3825641	eng	Unfortunately, I have a commitment.
3825645	eng	Tom said he wasn't coming.
3825649	eng	I wanted to feel comfortable.
3825662	eng	I promise that I'll come.
3825665	eng	That was Tom's favorite color.
3825672	eng	Aren't you a little cold?
3825673	eng	My hands are pretty cold.
3825679	eng	I only have American coins.
3825681	eng	That could be a coincidence.
3825689	eng	Let me grab my coat.
3825694	eng	Do you need baby clothes?
3825699	eng	Now listen to me closely.
3825700	eng	Why are your blinds closed?
3825706	eng	When does the bank close?
3825708	eng	This is my alarm clock.
3825711	eng	Everything has become much clearer.
3825715	eng	My room is always clean.
3825717	eng	There's water in the classroom.
3825725	eng	Boston is my favorite city.
3825728	eng	Tom likes tea with cinnamon.
3825729	eng	I think it's a cicada.
3825731	eng	We drank champagne last Christmas.
3825736	eng	Which puppy would you choose?
3825737	eng	Which skirt would you choose?
3825741	eng	Are there any other choices?
3825742	eng	There are also other choices.
3825743	eng	There are more practical choices.
3825749	eng	You have only one choice.
3825750	eng	You only have one choice.
3825751	eng	The test was multiple choice.
3825753	eng	Do you want those chocolates?
3825757	eng	I didn't see any children.
3825761	eng	I don't like painting children.
3825762	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't have children.
3825766	eng	I've always wanted a child.
3825771	eng	I want to play chess.
3825777	eng	When have I ever cheated?
3825778	eng	Are you saying I cheated?
3825779	eng	Tom wanted me to cheat.
3825781	eng	Nobody considers Tom a cheapskate.
3825783	eng	This piano is really cheap.
3825784	eng	Let's meet for a chat.
3825791	eng	My phone number has changed.
3825792	eng	Tom's phone number has changed.
3825808	eng	I'm not afraid of change.
3825809	eng	There will be other chances.
3825812	eng	This is our only chance.
3825816	eng	Please give us a chance.
3825817	eng	Please give Tom a chance.
3825820	eng	Tom wants to drink champagne.
3825821	eng	I'd love to have champagne.
3825826	eng	Tom walked into the cell.
3825830	eng	I don't like this CD.
3825834	eng	I was fired without cause.
3825835	eng	We can't find the cause.
3825838	eng	I knew you'd be caught.
3825848	eng	I don't like this cartoon.
3825851	eng	Don't walk on the carpet.
3825859	eng	Could you be more careful?
3825866	eng	Do you take credit cards?
3825884	eng	I really like this car.
3825890	eng	Let's get a smaller car.
3825891	eng	I have a blue car.
3825894	eng	Everyone got into the car.
3825900	eng	I finally washed the car.
3825903	eng	How old is the captain?
3825908	eng	Do you have any candles?
3825909	eng	Don't blow out the candle.
3825912	eng	Your order has been canceled.
3825922	eng	You do what you can.
3825924	eng	Get out if you can.
3825926	eng	Help me if you can.
3825934	eng	I come when I can.
3825939	eng	I have to stay calm.
3825940	eng	It's hard to stay calm.
3825944	eng	What time did you call?
3825947	eng	I made the wedding cake.
3825953	eng	Let's let bygones be bygones.
3825955	eng	Do you hear that buzzing?

3825989	eng	Tom slept on the bus.
3825993	eng	There was nothing to burn.
3825994	eng	Don't come dressed like bums.
3825996	eng	Tom lives in my building.
3825997	eng	We live in this building.
3826000	eng	Tom is a film buff.
3826001	eng	We're on a tight budget.
3826003	eng	You owe me thirty bucks.
3826007	eng	Are you really Tom's brother?
3826011	eng	This is my older brother.
3826014	eng	I can't find the broom.
3826016	eng	The washing machine is broken.

3826023	eng	I don't know the bride.
3826027	eng	I have some difficulty breathing.
3826029	eng	I've had some bad breaks.
3826030	eng	I had some bad breaks.
3826034	eng	I think I'll have breakfast.
3826036	eng	Do you need a break?
3826037	eng	They're on their lunch break.
3826042	eng	We've only got three bracelets.
3826044	eng	This toy is for boys.
3826052	eng	Tom is a stupid boy.
3826056	eng	There's something in the box.
3826066	eng	Why not go to Boston?
3826079	eng	Was Tom born in Boston?
3826080	eng	Are you still in Boston?
3826085	eng	Why did you leave Boston?
3826086	eng	I know you'll enjoy Boston.
3826087	eng	I'd love to visit Boston.
3826088	eng	We shouldn't have left Boston.
3826093	eng	We drove up to Boston.
3826096	eng	We didn't go to Boston.
3826103	eng	Tom will go to Boston.
3826121	eng	Come with me to Boston.
3826125	eng	It happens only in Boston.
3826128	eng	We bought it in Boston.
3826134	eng	I'm already back in Boston.
3826140	eng	I'm still here in Boston.
3826144	eng	I've just arrived in Boston.

3826146	eng	My girlfriend is from Boston.
3826147	eng	Tom is back from Boston.
3826151	eng	I always enjoy visiting Boston.
3826154	eng	I knew you'd like Boston.
3826158	eng	Do you think I'm boring?
3826159	eng	I find you very boring.
3826160	eng	This book is really boring.
3826173	eng	This was an interesting book.
3826179	eng	What happened to the boat?
3826183	eng	Do you think I'm bluffing?
3826187	eng	Tom painted the doors blue.
3826190	eng	Are you really a blonde?
3826193	eng	There will be a blizzard.
3826197	eng	Tom died in the blast.
3826199	eng	Get me an extra blanket.
3826204	eng	My favorite subject is biology.
3826208	eng	Tom has paid the bill.
3826209	eng	I can't buy a bike.
3826210	eng	I was on a bike.
3826211	eng	I don't have a bike.
3826212	eng	I can ride a bike.
3826213	eng	The world is very big.
3826225	eng	I couldn't say it better.
3826226	eng	I couldn't explain it better.
3826232	eng	My idea was much better.
3826233	eng	You could do much better.
3826234	eng	I haven't found anything better.
3826235	eng	We're hoping for something better.
3826236	eng	I'm sure you deserve better.
3826241	eng	You aren't doing your best.
3826243	eng	We hope for the best.
3826244	eng	You learned from the best.
3826248	eng	Didn't you hear the bell?
3826249	eng	Did you hear the bell?
3826250	eng	Should we ring the bell?
3826253	eng	What did I leave behind?
3826254	eng	I can't tolerate Tom's behavior.
3826255	eng	The rainy season has begun.
3826263	eng	I think we can begin.
3826269	eng	Did I mention that before?
3826274	eng	Has anyone tried this before?
3826276	eng	Have you met Tom before?
3826281	eng	Tom must've tried it before.
3826282	eng	I should've noticed it before.
3826284	eng	Tom must've done this before.
3826294	eng	Tom must've been here before.
3826301	eng	Let's not forget the beer.
3826303	eng	Tom offered Mary a beer.
3826304	eng	I just ordered a beer.
3826310	eng	This is really good beef.
3826311	eng	Isn't it past your bedtime?
3826312	eng	Are you still in bed?
3826317	eng	Do you consider yourself beautiful?
3826327	eng	I think you look beautiful.
3826335	eng	Are you growing a beard?
3826341	eng	Where will your party be?
3826344	eng	Where will the concert be?
3826345	eng	How complicated can it be?
3826346	eng	How difficult will it be?
3826348	eng	What good would that be?
3826349	eng	What would the advantages be?
3826354	eng	Where will the meeting be?
3826359	eng	Where will the picnic be?
3826367	eng	We're going to play basketball.
3826370	eng	Tom slept in the barn.
3826378	eng	How much is this ball?
3826380	eng	Tom has already gone bald.
3826383	eng	Do you have any bait?
3826384	eng	I have too many bags.
3826385	eng	I rarely use plastic bags.
3826392	eng	The situation is very bad.
3826393	eng	I know it's very bad.
3826394	eng	The weather's been really bad.
3826399	eng	Tom ate all the bacon.
3826401	eng	I'll stay in the background.
3826403	eng	Did you hurt your back?
3826405	eng	When will we go back?
3826406	eng	Are you ever coming back?
3826407	eng	Why would Tom come back?
3826413	eng	Maybe we should go back.
3826415	eng	You can always come back.
3826416	eng	We want to come back.
3826417	eng	Of course, I'll come back.
3826420	eng	Let's sit in the back.
3826426	eng	You look like a baboon.
3826433	eng	Why are you running away?
3826437	eng	Maybe I threw it away.
3826445	eng	Don't let them get away.
3826452	eng	Let's send them all away.
3826454	eng	Do you think they're awake?
3826457	eng	They walked along the avenue.
3826458	eng	Tom is writing an autobiography.
3826462	eng	Have you been to Australia?
3826467	eng	Is hitchhiking prohibited in Australia?
3826469	eng	Let's go back to Australia.
3826471	eng	You should come to Australia.
3826472	eng	This only happens in Australia.
3826473	eng	We bought this in Australia.
3826476	eng	My parents are in Australia.
3826478	eng	Tom has worked in Australia.
3826481	eng	You must be from Australia.
3826484	eng	Do you think I'm attractive?
3826489	eng	I'm up in the attic.
3826496	eng	What are you shooting at?
3826497	eng	What was Tom shooting at?
3826498	eng	Who are you staring at?
3826499	eng	What are you grinning at?
3826501	eng	May I apply for asylum?
3826514	eng	I'll do as you asked.
3826521	eng	Maybe I should be ashamed.
3826524	eng	Did you read the article?
3826526	eng	They think it was arson.
3826533	eng	Who taught you these arpeggios?
3826543	eng	There's no use in arguing.
3826544	eng	Let's not waste time arguing.
3826552	eng	Leave things as they are.
3826558	eng	I don't think that's appropriate.
3826559	eng	What time is your appointment?
3826560	eng	What time was your appointment?
3826562	eng	I bought a dozen apples.
3826564	eng	Tom is eating an apple.
3826565	eng	I've suddenly lost my appetite.
3826566	eng	I suddenly lost my appetite.
3826571	eng	You should at least apologize.
3826577	eng	Help me take this apart.
3826581	eng	What do you want anyway?
3826583	eng	How old are you, anyway?
3826588	eng	Don't you ever say anything?
3826591	eng	Why would I say anything?
3826599	eng	Have you ever stolen anything?
3826601	eng	Did you get me anything?
3826606	eng	Yesterday, I didn't say anything.
3826613	eng	No one here knows anything.
3826617	eng	Now I'm ready for anything.
3826621	eng	Tom didn't actually do anything.
3826633	eng	I didn't show them anything.
3826634	eng	I didn't give them anything.
3826637	eng	I'm still not understanding anything.
3826638	eng	I'm not scared of anything.
3826639	eng	Doing that won't solve anything.
3826640	eng	They wouldn't have done anything.
3826642	eng	No one owes me anything.
3826649	eng	Why would I hurt anyone?
3826651	eng	I didn't vote for anyone.
3826654	eng	Don't give it to anyone.
3826655	eng	This isn't news to anyone.
3826656	eng	I haven't heard from anyone.

3826703	eng	We don't walk anywhere anymore.
3826707	eng	Tom doesn't come here anymore.
3826714	eng	Don't give this to anybody.
3826724	eng	I'd prefer not to answer.
3826725	eng	They're waiting for an answer.
3826726	eng	No one knew the answer.
3826727	eng	It was a good answer.
3826728	eng	I'd prefer to remain anonymous.
3826732	eng	I have a swollen ankle.
3826733	eng	I have a sprained ankle.
3826734	eng	I love to watch anime.
3826735	eng	I like to watch anime.
3826739	eng	Why would Tom be angry?
3826741	eng	Tom is still very angry.
3826749	eng	Tom said you were angry.
3826750	eng	Tom always makes me angry.
3826769	eng	Did you consider other alternatives?
3826774	eng	Did you know this already?
3826775	eng	Has Tom come back already?
3826779	eng	I've worked three hours already.
3826785	eng	Why don't you go alone?
3826786	eng	Do you really live alone?
3826792	eng	At least I wasn't alone.
3826793	eng	Remember that you aren't alone.
3826795	eng	I have to go alone.
3826798	eng	You should leave me alone.
3826802	eng	Did you beat them all?
3826807	eng	Now I understand it all.
3826816	eng	I don't agree at all.
3826817	eng	I'm not surprised at all.
3826818	eng	I wasn't scared at all.
3826822	eng	Is there anyone left alive?
3826825	eng	I'm glad you're still alive.
3826828	eng	Does Tom have an alibi?
3826829	eng	They released a new album.
3826832	eng	This car has an alarm.
3826839	eng	What can you see ahead?
3826841	eng	Does that mean you agree?
3826843	eng	Oh yeah, I totally agree.
3826846	eng	Maybe even Tom would agree.
3826847	eng	It was three hours ago.
3826856	eng	Won't you please try again?
3826860	eng	Will I see you again?
3826865	eng	What was his name again?
3826867	eng	You have to try again.
3826868	eng	We'll have to try again.
3826873	eng	I'll never see you again.
3826877	eng	Let me see you again.
3826882	eng	I can't do it again.
3826887	eng	Don't ever mention that again.
3826898	eng	I met with Tom again.
3826915	eng	I've changed my mind again.
3826916	eng	Where were you yesterday afternoon?
3826926	eng	I sold it this afternoon.
3826929	eng	The meeting was this afternoon.
3826936	eng	I studied French all afternoon.
3826953	eng	I think I'm seriously addicted.
3826956	eng	You look like an actress.
3826959	eng	You have to be active.
3826961	eng	That's a very serious accusation.
3826964	eng	Did you have an accident?
3826965	eng	I had a serious accident.
3826970	eng	It was a tragic accident.
3826971	eng	I don't have Internet access.
3826973	eng	It doesn't seem so absurd.
3826976	eng	That's why I was absent.
3826980	eng	What was it all about?
3826983	eng	What are you babbling about?
3826984	eng	Who are they talking about?
3826985	eng	What are we talking about?
3826986	eng	Who are we talking about?
3826992	eng	Here's something to think about.
3830360	eng	To think means to compare.
3830655	eng	What more can be said?
3830665	eng	My greatest fear is drowning.
3830666	eng	Is your freezer still working?
3830667	eng	Is your conscience bothering you?
3830669	eng	I need you to listen.
3831089	eng	You're just a little homesick.
3831091	eng	Tom wants to say goodbye.
3831094	eng	Tom said it wasn't necessary.
3831263	eng	Tom thinks I'm a wimp.
3831264	eng	My work is very important.

3856079	eng	Did you understand your mistake?
3856094	eng	This is a pretty dress.
3856475	eng	Why do you know that?
3856494	eng	Why are you so smart?
3856799	eng	Tom was killed in battle.
3856818	eng	She joined the Red Cross.
3856853	eng	Tom is a fervent churchgoer.
3856897	eng	That was a wonderful success.
3857540	eng	Our house started to shake.
3859117	eng	Throw away these socks, please.
3859214	eng	Tom was coughing from smoke.
3859246	eng	This area has been quarantined.
3860030	eng	It could have been anybody.
3860049	eng	Robin Hood robbed the rich.
3860087	eng	She flew home to Boston.
3860108	eng	This may have lethal consequences.
3860226	eng	I'm having so much fun.
3860360	eng	He bugged her with questions.
3861612	eng	She slowly opened her eyes.

3862609	eng	It's a really complicated job.
3862670	eng	Is it "God" or "god"?
3863033	eng	We're in an open war.
3863416	eng	Tom has no practical experience.
3863880	eng	I haven't worked for years.
3864031	eng	He pestered her with questions.
3864700	eng	He was wearing a tux.
3864729	eng	The photo shoot was fun.
3864994	eng	We are studying French together.
3865180	eng	None of them knows French.
3865185	eng	I'll have none of it.
3865205	eng	I'll have none of that.
3865407	eng	There is no eternal love.
3865522	eng	Tom's voice quavered, betraying him.
3865862	eng	You agree with Tom, right?
3866352	eng	Art lasts, life goes by.
3867548	eng	From the mouths of babes.
3867718	eng	Fame is a magnifying glass.
3868719	eng	What language is he speaking?

3869716	eng	I'd suggest you buy it.
3869719	eng	Maybe you should buy it.
3869720	eng	You should probably buy it.
3870062	eng	Water and oil don't mix.
3870064	eng	I even work on Sundays.
3870080	eng	I basically like your plan.
3870087	eng	My brother's in Australia now.
3870094	eng	I'll get there before you.
3870279	eng	He doesn't speak English either.
3871019	eng	The story gave me goosebumps.
3871162	eng	She doesn't stop writing letters.
3871163	eng	She won't stop beating me.
3871215	eng	Are you sleeping with him?
3871270	eng	Do you want to sit?
3871271	eng	Do you want to sing?
3871344	eng	Are you expecting any visitors?
3871350	eng	He passed by the house.
3871395	eng	Do we have a blog?
3871448	eng	Try some of this cake.
3871449	eng	My real name is Mary.
3872436	eng	It's not a good start.
3872627	eng	Avalanches move faster than floods.

3872667	eng	How long is this blade?
3872742	eng	This machine is environmentally friendly.
3872852	eng	Help! Help! I'm being repressed!
3872937	eng	Let's try a small experiment.
3872944	eng	The tunnel was declared safe.
3872964	eng	This is a never-ending task.

3873136	eng	What happened to your eyes?
3873144	eng	Monkeys are kept in cages.
3873151	eng	Only your frigging job matters.
3873166	eng	You should be safe there.
3873181	eng	Man, I hate this guy.
3873183	eng	Now you're talking to birds.
3873203	eng	Mary, stop. I can explain.
3873205	eng	Monsters. That's all you are.
3873264	eng	You don't have to die.
3873515	eng	I'm only doing my duty.
3873851	eng	How many children are there?
3873865	eng	We had no school today!
3873869	eng	We didn't have school today.
3873880	eng	Mary was sipping her margarita.
3873883	eng	Men wore hats back then.
3874089	eng	Just sit back and watch.
3874522	eng	I gave it to him.
3874524	eng	I gave it to her.
3875936	eng	Do you like pineapple soda?
3876605	eng	His music makes me dream.
3876606	eng	Her music makes me dream.
3876608	eng	Their music makes me dream.
3876802	eng	I usually read labels carefully.
3876882	eng	He has a sharp mind.
3877163	eng	I won't say that twice!
3877367	eng	Congratulate Mary for her graduation.
3877372	eng	Get away from the fire.
3877381	eng	I called you for help.
3877388	eng	I didn't kill those guys.
3877402	eng	I'm here to warn you.
3877418	eng	What happened to my treehouse?
3877421	eng	I've never seen your house.
3877472	eng	The Chinese are coming? When?
3877538	eng	This river is totally non-navigable.
3877539	eng	This truck is very noisy.
3877555	eng	Tom can testify to that.
3877559	eng	Tom is guilty of murder.
3877562	eng	Tom was a chain smoker.
3877564	eng	We are the future, guys.
3877579	eng	What's this funny-looking car called?
3877642	eng	The plane began its descent.
3877878	eng	The plane wandered off course.
3878490	eng	Eventually, we reached a compromise.
3878538	eng	Do you like doing homework?
3878782	eng	Really? I didn't know that.
3879373	eng	I just finished doing that.
3879375	eng	I just finished doing it.
3879403	eng	Why do you even ask?
3879406	eng	Do you have a girl?
3879465	eng	Would you like a seat?
3879511	eng	If anything happens, call me.
3879611	eng	Don't call me your son.
3879624	eng	I'm not your angel anymore.
3879664	eng	Your hair is different today.
3879667	eng	Are we disturbing you, guys?
3879668	eng	Do you want some cake?
3879669	eng	I'm moving away to Boston.
3879675	eng	She's hiding something from you.
3879681	eng	He's not lucky in love.
3879690	eng	You shouldn't have abandoned me.
3879706	eng	You like watches, don't you?
3879882	eng	His mother was very superstitious.
3880333	eng	Does your girlfriend speak English?
3880345	eng	I haven't seen the description.
3880347	eng	Are you acquainted with C++?
3880350	eng	Which browser is your favourite?
3880396	eng	I'm taking my stuff upstairs.
3880400	eng	There were people talking upstairs.
3880402	eng	She's upstairs in my room.
3880413	eng	The art exhibition is upstairs.
3880447	eng	Our factories are working perfectly.
3880557	eng	It was a complete nightmare.
3880692	eng	It all happened very quickly.
3881518	eng	I think it's pretty weird.
3881519	eng	He barely leaves the house.
3881577	eng	The police didn't find fingerprints.
3881605	eng	I'll pretend this never happened.
3881607	eng	We'll pretend this never happened.
3881666	eng	This has to stop immediately.
3881667	eng	These ideas come from you.
3881687	eng	She always wore trendy clothes.
3881692	eng	You're a terrific guy, Tom.
3884046	eng	Her husband is my friend.
3884108	eng	I have nothing for you.
3884974	eng	It's an incredibly moving story.
3885642	eng	How fast did he run?
3886195	eng	Get your paws off me.
3886618	eng	I just couldn't stop crying.
3886729	eng	The enemy suffered staggering casualties.
3886817	eng	That was an unfortunate choice.
3886953	eng	This is a beaver dam.
3887459	eng	What is your preferred pronoun?
3887645	eng	He looks thinner every day.
3887927	eng	I subscribed to a newspaper.
3887942	eng	Is that black briefcase yours?
3887952	eng	That's all I should say.
3888088	eng	I'm not saluting your flag.
3888091	eng	I don't pack your suitcases.
3888094	eng	I don't sow your wheat.

3888159	eng	The doctors examined the baby.
3888658	eng	How old is his sister?
3889141	eng	I could see caimans everywhere.
3890785	eng	Her name was not known.
3890992	eng	Where shall we go now?
3891150	eng	The plane began to descend.
3891166	eng	Everyone on board was safe.
3891202	eng	These details captured my attention.
3891546	eng	I'm waiting for my turn.
3891577	eng	The hurricane continued to rage.
3891581	eng	Pilot Tom Jackson took over.
3893077	eng	I tried to act naturally.
3893092	eng	Tom, we'll start with you.
3893096	eng	Tom, we'll begin with you.
3893108	eng	Tomorrow I'll clean my room.

3893289	eng	The book is up there.
3893971	eng	You should use a deodorant.
3894528	eng	Can I have a toke?
3895144	eng	This story is especially interesting.
3895152	eng	Just shut up and listen!
3895162	eng	I came here for you.
3895179	eng	This is not a secret.
3895181	eng	Women aren't interested in him.

3895189	eng	Dad, what are you doing?
3895521	eng	He has been in prison.
3896314	eng	Do you believe in horoscopes?
3896458	eng	Are you 17 years old?

3896523	eng	He was on parole then.
3896547	eng	This substance conducts electricity well.
3896721	eng	I jumped on the opportunity.
3896739	eng	The ship was on fire.
3897160	eng	She is taller than me.
3897166	eng	He got 90 in English.
3897171	eng	How do you know Mary?
3897616	eng	She sleeps with her boss.
3898059	eng	Mary took her earrings off.
3898637	eng	You should've kept that secret.
3898641	eng	I should've kept that secret.
3898643	eng	Your body image may decline.
3900590	eng	I have friends in London.

4012463	eng	Are you two back together?
4012468	eng	What's wrong with you today?
4012479	eng	It looks like rain today.
4012484	eng	How were the kids today?
4012486	eng	What's going on here today?
4012487	eng	Why are we here today?
4012490	eng	What's wrong with everyone today?
4012493	eng	Have you been drinking today?
4012494	eng	Has Tom been drinking today?
4012500	eng	There are no classes today.
4012501	eng	We don't have classes today.
4012503	eng	It's what was agreed to.
4012527	eng	This may take some time.
4012528	eng	That might take some time.
4012530	eng	It could take some time.
4012531	eng	This could take some time.
4012534	eng	Tom always arrives on time.
4012541	eng	What's taking so much time?
4012544	eng	There isn't any more time.
4012545	eng	Take a little more time.
4012547	eng	That's a really long time.
4012551	eng	That's quite a long time.
4012572	eng	Please drop by any time.
4012576	eng	Tom rarely wears a tie.
4012581	eng	Where are the other three?
4012587	eng	That's not a bad thought.
4012593	eng	Are you familiar with this?
4012607	eng	What if somebody saw this?
4012622	eng	It's not normally like this.
4012624	eng	It wasn't always like this.
4012636	eng	Perhaps you'd better handle this.
4012643	eng	There's no time for this.
4012647	eng	Look, I can explain this.
4012652	eng	Who else could've done this?
4012664	eng	I'm tired of doing this.
4012689	eng	All right, let's do this.
4012690	eng	Perhaps you'd better do this.
4012710	eng	Who's responsible for all this?
4012714	eng	What's so funny about this?
4012717	eng	Is Tom serious about this?
4012726	eng	Is Tom really only thirty?
4012729	eng	What exactly do you think?
4012733	eng	Is that what everyone thinks?
4012737	eng	What exactly are you thinking?
4012741	eng	What do you honestly think?
4012752	eng	Aren't you forgetting one thing?
4012753	eng	Isn't that a good thing?
4012768	eng	Did you meet Tom there?
4012775	eng	How's it going over there?
4012777	eng	What's Tom doing over there?
4012780	eng	There's a seat over there.
4012782	eng	How's the weather out there?
4012784	eng	It's getting cold out there.
4012785	eng	Is everyone out of there?
4012787	eng	What other option is there?
4012788	eng	What other choice is there?
4012789	eng	Is Tom actually in there?
4012795	eng	What's so interesting in there?
4012802	eng	It's very dark in there.
4012813	eng	How's it going down there?
4012817	eng	There might be doctors there.
4012833	eng	Wasn't that Tom back there?
4012834	eng	How's it going back there?
4012836	eng	Everyone else is already there.
4012839	eng	What will Tom do then?
4012851	eng	Are you familiar with that?
4012856	eng	Are you through with that?
4012862	eng	Do you disagree with that?
4012863	eng	Are you satisfied with that?
4012869	eng	Why does everybody think that?
4012875	eng	Would you please stop that?
4012877	eng	Could you stop saying that?
4012879	eng	Did Tom really say that?
4012880	eng	Do people really say that?
4012881	eng	Why does everybody say that?
4012883	eng	Did I just say that?
4012888	eng	No one could've predicted that.
4012889	eng	Could you elaborate on that?
4012896	eng	What's the value of that?
4012900	eng	What's the significance of that?
4012908	eng	Please stop calling me that.
4012920	eng	It's not exactly like that.
4012937	eng	Why can't I have that?
4012939	eng	Perhaps I could handle that.
4012944	eng	Are you prepared for that?
4012945	eng	There's no time for that.
4012948	eng	There's no need for that.
4012952	eng	How did Tom explain that?
4012956	eng	Would you quit doing that?
4012962	eng	Why's Tom still doing that?
4012965	eng	Shouldn't Tom be doing that?
4013001	eng	Why should we do that?
4013022	eng	Tom likes to do that.
4013038	eng	How did you determine that?
4013040	eng	Would you please consider that?
4013049	eng	Does Tom really believe that?
4013050	eng	Why can't you believe that?
4013052	eng	Why should I believe that?
4013059	eng	Could you help arrange that?
4013069	eng	What's so funny about that?
4013074	eng	What's so great about that?
4013075	eng	Were you serious about that?
4013084	eng	What's so weird about that?
4013085	eng	What's so complicated about that?
4013086	eng	What's so fantastic about that?
4013095	eng	Is that a technical term?
4013115	eng	What classes do you teach?
4013117	eng	Are you the science teacher?
4013124	eng	It's about three feet tall.
4013126	eng	What medications are you taking?
4013127	eng	What classes are you taking?
4013136	eng	How long would that take?
4013151	eng	There's food on the table.
4013153	eng	Did you pack your swimsuit?
4013154	eng	Did you see anything suspicious?
4013155	eng	Who were the other suspects?
4013156	eng	There were only three survivors.
4013158	eng	Where are the other survivors?
4013164	eng	This is a nice surprise.
4013167	eng	It was a complete surprise.
4013171	eng	Please take off your sunglasses.
4013183	eng	Tom didn't wear a suit.
4013187	eng	Let me change the subject.
4013193	eng	It's the same old story.
4013199	eng	It's an awfully good story.
4013203	eng	Is all this stuff stolen?
4013207	eng	What else did you steal?
4013226	eng	This is an excellent start.
4013229	eng	Well, should we get started?
4013230	eng	Come on, let's get started.
4013247	eng	Could you pass the spaghetti?
4013256	eng	This might be over soon.
4013265	eng	Did you hide it somewhere?
4013278	eng	Tom slid down the slide.
4013283	eng	Have you ever gone skiing?
4013284	eng	Have you ever tried skateboarding?
4013286	eng	Does Tom understand the situation?
4013287	eng	How well do you sing?
4013290	eng	It wasn't really that simple.
4013291	eng	It wasn't quite that simple.
4013292	eng	It can't be that simple.
4013293	eng	Sometimes it's not so simple.
4013295	eng	It's all really quite simple.
4013296	eng	Actually, it was quite simple.
4013298	eng	It's really all quite simple.
4013301	eng	There was an eerie silence.
4013303	eng	It's actually a good sign.
4013304	eng	Maybe that's a good sign.
4013308	eng	Tom didn't take a shower.
4013325	eng	It's on the bottom shelf.
4013329	eng	Should we call room service?
4013331	eng	What purpose does this serve?
4013332	eng	What purpose would that serve?
4013333	eng	Are you two getting serious?
4013337	eng	That doesn't make much sense.
4013338	eng	It doesn't make much sense.
4013348	eng	There's not much to see.
4013352	eng	Perhaps we should call security.
4013374	eng	It'll only take a second.
4013388	eng	Tell me about your school.
4013391	eng	Tom sometimes walks to school.
4013405	eng	Go get ready for school.
4013407	eng	Were you really home schooled?
4013414	eng	What's next on your schedule?
4013417	eng	What's next on the schedule?
4013418	eng	Let me check the schedule.
4013419	eng	Tom admitted he was scared.
4013432	eng	There isn't much to say.
4013440	eng	What does the sign say?
4013448	eng	What did the doctors say?
4013449	eng	What did the captain say?
4013456	eng	Can I have another sandwich?
4013457	eng	It looks exactly the same.
4013458	eng	Everything looks exactly the same.
4013459	eng	It's not quite the same.
4013473	eng	There's no place to run.
4013475	eng	Why's the engine still running?
4013477	eng	It's probably just a rumor.
4013478	eng	Let's go to your room.
4013510	eng	It was a calculated risk.
4013522	eng	It's really pretty easy, right?
4013526	eng	Are you children all right?
4013531	eng	This place is all right.
4013534	eng	Who said anything about retiring?
4013544	eng	What information do you require?
4013546	eng	Are you refusing my request?
4013547	eng	What information are you requesting?
4013560	eng	It's nice to be remembered.
4013563	eng	It's not really that relaxing.
4013565	eng	How could I possibly refuse?
4013569	eng	What's wrong with the refrigerator?
4013577	eng	Have you hugged anyone recently?
4013579	eng	What was the second reason?
4013580	eng	That's not the real reason.
4013581	eng	Is that the only reason?
4013582	eng	That's not the only reason.
4013584	eng	It's all pretty simple really.
4013599	eng	It's already started to rain.
4013601	eng	Do you have a raincoat?
4013605	eng	Who said anything about quitting?
4013606	eng	Are you usually this quiet?
4013607	eng	Are you normally this quiet?
4013608	eng	Are you always this quiet?
4013609	eng	Tom closed the door quietly.
4013628	eng	Tom couldn't answer my question.
4013630	eng	Was that a dumb question?
4013635	eng	What's Tom trying to prove?
4013637	eng	What exactly are you proposing?
4013639	eng	Please get off my property.
4013645	eng	It's an extremely complicated process.
4013663	eng	Where are the other prisoners?
4013664	eng	It's not a high priority.
4013666	eng	It's actually kind of pretty.
4013672	eng	It was a wise precaution.
4013678	eng	How is that even possible?
4013679	eng	Maybe it's not even possible.
4013681	eng	That might not be possible.
4013685	eng	Keep as still as possible.
4013689	eng	Is this beef or pork?
4013690	eng	Please get off my porch.
4013694	eng	Shouldn't you call the police?
4013698	eng	Have you called the police?
4013699	eng	I think that's rat poison.
4013701	eng	It's probably just food poisoning.
4013702	eng	Have you checked your pockets?
4013710	eng	Will you excuse us, please?
4013711	eng	Would you excuse us, please?
4013712	eng	Could you excuse us, please?
4013713	eng	Would you stand up, please?
4013714	eng	Could you stand up, please?
4013719	eng	Could you hold that, please?
4013720	eng	Would you be quiet, please?
4013730	eng	Would you excuse me, please?
4013731	eng	Could you excuse me, please?
4013733	eng	Could you describe it, please?
4013739	eng	Go a little faster, please.
4013752	eng	All right, here's the plan.
4013756	eng	There's been change of plan.
4013758	eng	Everything went exactly as planned.
4013760	eng	That wasn't exactly my plan.
4013770	eng	It wasn't really a plan.
4013784	eng	Who was in second place?
4013788	eng	This is a fantastic place.
4013791	eng	Tom called me a pig.
4013797	eng	What's wrong with your phone?
4013801	eng	I've always wanted a pet.
4013802	eng	Do you recognize that person?
4013803	eng	Are you a superstitious person?
4013807	eng	Tom is an outgoing person.
4013810	eng	That was pretty much perfect.
4013814	eng	Tom lost his favorite pen.
4013829	eng	Enjoy yourself at the party.
4013835	eng	This is a private party.
4013848	eng	How was the bachelor party?
4013849	eng	Tom auditioned for the part.
4013859	eng	How tall are your parents?
4013863	eng	Did you finish your paper?
4013866	eng	There's no reason for panic.
4013869	eng	This should relieve the pain.
4013879	eng	Perhaps I should take over.
4013891	eng	There's no other way out.
4013893	eng	This should be thrown out.
4013895	eng	Would you mind waiting outside?
4013897	eng	There's a cab waiting outside.
4013899	eng	Would you rather wait outside?
4013902	eng	What's the weather like outside?
4013905	eng	Who locked the dog outside?
4013922	eng	Well, let's go find out.
4013930	eng	How will we protect ourselves?
4013932	eng	Don't you know each other?
4013945	eng	Do you always obey orders?
4013946	eng	There are only three options.
4013947	eng	We only have three options.
4013949	eng	Are there any other options?
4013953	eng	Thanks again for the opportunity.
4013954	eng	This is your last opportunity.
4013956	eng	Who asked for your opinion?
4013957	eng	Is that your professional opinion?
4013958	eng	Is that a personal opinion?
4013960	eng	Is the bank still open?
4013961	eng	The back door is open.
4013962	eng	Tom pushed the gate open.
4013966	eng	Why leave the door open?
4013968	eng	Someone left the door open.
4013972	eng	What medication is Tom on?
4013973	eng	Tom didn't have shoes on.
4013975	eng	All right, let's move on.
4013976	eng	You left your headlights on.
4013980	eng	All right, what's going on?
4013981	eng	Excuse me, what's going on?
4013982	eng	So what's been going on?
4013994	eng	The light came back on.
4013995	eng	It's what we agreed on.
4013997	eng	Look, I'm really sorry, OK?
4014013	eng	Will you stop showing off?
4014014	eng	What are you frightened of?
4014025	eng	Have you considered my offer?
4014026	eng	That's a very generous offer.
4014028	eng	It's already taken care of.
4014029	eng	It's been taken care of.
4014039	eng	What's your license plate number?
4014043	eng	OK, I'll stop worrying now.
4014048	eng	It's up to Tom now.
4014058	eng	Please leave the room now.
4014062	eng	What's going on right now?
4014079	eng	I'm really scared right now.
4014082	eng	What are your plans now?
4014083	eng	Everybody hates each other now.
4014089	eng	What does that matter now?
4014091	eng	Would you mind leaving now?
4014098	eng	I'm doing my homework now.
4014114	eng	What does Tom do now?
4014121	eng	Why are things different now?
4014133	eng	Are you feeling better now?
4014153	eng	What symptoms have you noticed?
4014165	eng	Why not spend the night?
4014168	eng	Where were you Monday night?
4014181	eng	Were you working last night?
4014191	eng	This is an important night.
4014196	eng	That would've been very nice.
4014198	eng	This place is quite nice.
4014203	eng	So what's the good news?
4014204	eng	I have some good news.
4014209	eng	This is a bad neighborhood.
4014219	eng	It's nice to feel needed.
4014228	eng	That may not be necessary.
4014229	eng	That might not be necessary.
4014230	eng	That'll no longer be necessary.
4014233	eng	That's not his real name.
4014234	eng	That's a very pretty name.
4014235	eng	That's a really nice name.
4014236	eng	What was your mother's name?
4014242	eng	What was your father's name?
4014253	eng	This is really too much.
4014255	eng	It's really not that much.
4014270	eng	So what's the next move?
4014275	eng	Where were you yesterday morning?
4014276	eng	It'll be delivered tomorrow morning.
4014280	eng	Were you here this morning?
4014322	eng	I'll never forget this moment.
4014338	eng	Please excuse us a moment.
4014340	eng	This'll only take a moment.
4014342	eng	There might've been a mix-up.
4014347	eng	It was a simple mistake.
4014350	eng	It was an innocent mistake.
4014352	eng	Was it an honest mistake?
4014353	eng	It was a genuine mistake.
4014357	eng	It was probably a mistake.
4014359	eng	There's obviously been a mistake.
4014361	eng	Obviously I made a mistake.
4014365	eng	It'll only take three minutes.
4014372	eng	Come back in five minutes.
4014380	eng	It'll take a few minutes.
4014399	eng	This'll only take a minute.
4014408	eng	What could've changed Tom's mind?
4014412	eng	Maybe I'm losing my mind.
4014413	eng	Look, I've changed my mind.
4014422	eng	Do you want some milk?
4014424	eng	It's about three square miles.
4014428	eng	Tom bought himself a microscope.
4014453	eng	Is anyone listening to me?
4014457	eng	Please just listen to me.
4014468	eng	Don't try and stop me.
4014469	eng	It was a private message.
4014478	eng	Thank you for reminding me.
4014503	eng	Perhaps you could help me.
4014520	eng	Have you been following me?
4014522	eng	Where did you two meet?
4014529	eng	This is a private meeting.
4014534	eng	Are you on any medications?
4014535	eng	Is Tom on any medications?
4014545	eng	Have you been avoiding me?
4014547	eng	Please stop looking at me.
4014558	eng	What's this supposed to mean?
4014559	eng	What do these symbols mean?
4014563	eng	What's Tom got against me?
4014565	eng	Were you concerned about me?
4014568	eng	It was a private matter.
4014569	eng	This is a personal matter.
4014570	eng	This isn't a joking matter.
4014586	eng	Tom didn't apologize to Mary.
4014594	eng	Tom didn't even see Mary.
4014596	eng	Maybe Tom didn't notice Mary.
4014616	eng	Why's Tom mad at Mary?
4014622	eng	How long were you married?
4014632	eng	Do you sell road maps?
4014636	eng	Tom is an extraordinary man.
4014642	eng	That's my decision to make.
4014651	eng	What difference would that've made?
4014652	eng	When was this decision made?
4014660	eng	Tom doesn't study a lot.
4014678	eng	It's riskier than it looks.
4014680	eng	Where do we start looking?
4014682	eng	Well, let's have a look.
4014683	eng	Has Tom been waiting long?
4014684	eng	This shouldn't take very long.
4014687	eng	What's taking everybody so long?
4014690	eng	Thanks for waiting so long.
4014696	eng	It can't last much longer.
4014697	eng	It shouldn't take much longer.
4014708	eng	The front door is locked.
4014710	eng	Why is this door locked?
4014711	eng	Why was the door locked?
4014713	eng	What is your present location?
4014714	eng	Please wait in the lobby.
4014716	eng	Actually, the gun isn't loaded.
4014720	eng	Where do you really live?
4014722	eng	How long do horses live?
4014723	eng	Where does your family live?
4014727	eng	This might hurt a little.
4014729	eng	Who's first on your list?
4014731	eng	Let me have the list.
4014733	eng	Everyone pretended not to listen.
4014745	eng	What does this look like?
4014752	eng	What does that feel like?
4014755	eng	Did you flash your lights?
4014759	eng	Why aren't there any lights?
4014769	eng	Tom showed me the letter.
4014773	eng	There's just one chair left.
4014777	eng	Just look at those legs.
4014787	eng	There's very little time left.
4014788	eng	There were only three left.
4014790	eng	There's plenty of stuff left.
4014791	eng	There aren't any options left.
4014819	eng	I guess I'd better leave.
4014824	eng	Is that against the law?
4014825	eng	It's not against the law.
4014828	eng	Everyone in the room laughed.
4014833	eng	Maybe it's not too late.
4014834	eng	It's still not too late.
4014851	eng	Maybe I'll come back later.
4014853	eng	It really is quite late.
4014856	eng	It's getting kind of late.
4014857	eng	I'm a few minutes late.
4014874	eng	Please get off my land.
4014875	eng	Does Tom know you know?
4014888	eng	How could you possibly know?
4014897	eng	Have you two been kissing?
4014900	eng	How many people were killed?
4014934	eng	Are you quitting your job?
4014956	eng	Have you met the Jacksons?
4014958	eng	What's the matter with it?
4014968	eng	That wasn't accurate, was it?
4014971	eng	Everyone's looking forward to it.
4014998	eng	It's very impressive, isn't it?
4015000	eng	It's pretty romantic, isn't it?
4015019	eng	Why didn't Tom find it?
4015026	eng	Who else might've done it?
4015028	eng	Everybody else is doing it.
4015060	eng	How would you describe it?
4015062	eng	What could be causing it?
4015075	eng	Did you complain about it?
4015087	eng	Everyone's been talking about it.
4015116	eng	What department are you in?
4015119	eng	There's no other way in.
4015125	eng	It wasn't a job interview.
4015127	eng	It's really not very interesting.
4015128	eng	Actually, it was very interesting.
4015130	eng	It's really not that interesting.
4015131	eng	It's actually kind of interesting.
4015134	eng	Did you see anything interesting?
4015143	eng	Have you gone completely insane?
4015155	eng	It really is an inconvenience.
4015161	eng	There's some room for improvement.
4015164	eng	It's difficult but not impossible.
4015172	eng	Why is alternative energy important?
4015173	eng	What exactly are you implying?
4015175	eng	It's almost impossible to imagine.
4015184	eng	That's a very intriguing idea.
4015191	eng	Maybe that's a good idea.
4015203	eng	It's definitely a bad idea.
4015209	eng	Do you want some ice?
4015210	eng	It was only a hypothesis.
4015211	eng	Have you ever been hypnotized?
4015225	eng	Where exactly is your house?
4015251	eng	It'll take approximately three hours.
4015259	eng	That'll take a couple hours.
4015262	eng	It's really not that hot.
4015267	eng	They killed three more hostages.
4015268	eng	Are you being held hostage?
4015285	eng	Thanks for driving me home.
4015288	eng	Did Tom drive himself home?
4015292	eng	Everyone else has gone home.
4015295	eng	How are you getting home?
4015305	eng	Are you moving back home?
4015344	eng	There's no need to hide.
4015354	eng	No one knows you're here.
4015358	eng	Why are you working here?
4015365	eng	Does anyone know we're here?
4015377	eng	There's no buried treasure here.
4015389	eng	There are some sandwiches here.
4015390	eng	There's no more room here.
4015391	eng	Would you sign right here?
4015393	eng	It should be right here.
4015417	eng	It's kind of nice here.
4015422	eng	Thanks for meeting me here.
4015423	eng	Please don't leave me here.
4015424	eng	Do you like living here?
4015429	eng	Why is everybody in here?
4015435	eng	How's everyone doing in here?
4015437	eng	It's very dusty in here.
4015439	eng	It's getting hot in here.
4015443	eng	It's freezing cold in here.
4015444	eng	It's getting cold in here.
4015445	eng	No one's allowed in here.
4015446	eng	Who wouldn't be happy here?
4015463	eng	Are you all finished here?
4015467	eng	There's no one else here.
4015474	eng	What's Tom even doing here?
4015483	eng	There's work to do here.
4015494	eng	Tom has never been here.
4015504	eng	What brings you back here?
4015505	eng	What's going on back here?
4015506	eng	What's Tom doing back here?
4015514	eng	It's pretty quiet around here.
4015516	eng	Listen, we need your help.
4015533	eng	I've asked Tom to help.
4015550	eng	That would be very helpful.
4015551	eng	Is Tom always this helpful?
4015552	eng	Is Tom always so helpful?
4015554	eng	That would be extremely helpful.
4015574	eng	Things got a bit hectic.
4015575	eng	It's really not that heavy.
4015576	eng	These suitcases are really heavy.
4015598	eng	I can't find my hat.
4015600	eng	Tom must've practiced very hard.
4015601	eng	That shouldn't be too hard.
4015602	eng	This shouldn't be this hard.
4015604	eng	This shouldn't be so hard.
4015658	eng	Do you recognize that guy?
4015660	eng	What's wrong with you guys?
4015663	eng	Tom is a creative guy.
4015671	eng	What Tom needs is guidance.
4015672	eng	Who are the other guests?
4015677	eng	It was actually really great.
4015689	eng	Where's Tom supposed to go?
4015695	eng	My eyesight isn't very good.
4015696	eng	My French isn't that good.
4015698	eng	This pizza is really good.
4015699	eng	This is actually quite good.
4015716	eng	All right, people, let's go.
4015721	eng	Where exactly are you going?
4015724	eng	Where exactly are we going?
4015725	eng	Exactly where are we going?
4015727	eng	Where's the next train going?
4015731	eng	How are the negotiations going?
4015733	eng	All right, let's get going.
4015734	eng	I guess I'll be going.
4015735	eng	Perhaps I should be going.
4015739	eng	I guess I'd better go.
4015740	eng	Where do the batteries go?
4015744	eng	Can I borrow your glasses?
4015745	eng	Could you remove your glasses?
4015746	eng	Do we have enough glasses?
4015747	eng	Do you recognize that girl?
4015748	eng	Are you really Tom's girlfriend?
4015758	eng	What does the winner get?
4015763	eng	How hot will it get?
4015764	eng	How cold will it get?
4015777	eng	It's actually kind of fun.
4015778	eng	This is no longer funny.
4015795	eng	Tom has lots of friends.
4015796	eng	Does Tom have many friends?
4015825	eng	Where was the knife found?
4015832	eng	What are you whispering for?
4015833	eng	What are they waiting for?
4015835	eng	What were you waiting for?
4015839	eng	What's it we're waiting for?
4015848	eng	What are you stopping for?
4015851	eng	What am I responsible for?
4015852	eng	What are those pills for?
4015853	eng	Please fill out these forms.
4015860	eng	Who were they looking for?
4015861	eng	What were you looking for?
4015865	eng	What was Tom looking for?
4015872	eng	What are we listening for?
4015881	eng	What are the flowers for?
4015882	eng	What are we fighting for?
4015889	eng	Here's what you asked for.
4015895	eng	What's Tom hanging around for?
4015900	eng	What are you apologizing for?
4015905	eng	What's wrong with the food?
4015915	eng	Tom didn't water the flowers.
4015921	eng	There's blood on the floor.
4015923	eng	Why is that light flashing?
4015932	eng	That's why Tom was fired.
4015936	eng	Please allow me to finish.
4015942	eng	What exactly did you find?
4015948	eng	It's time to stop fighting.
4015950	eng	Have you two been fighting?
4015952	eng	It wasn't really a fight.
4015965	eng	It's actually kind of fascinating.
4015982	eng	What caused the power failure?
4015985	eng	There was a loud explosion.
4015986	eng	There's no time for explanations.
4015987	eng	What's the most logical explanation?
4015988	eng	It's the only logical explanation.
4015990	eng	It's not easy to explain.
4015991	eng	It's very difficult to explain.
4016000	eng	Actually, it's hard to explain.
4016002	eng	It was a terrific experience.
4016003	eng	It was a remarkable experience.
4016004	eng	It just got too expensive.
4016005	eng	It's really not that expensive.
4016007	eng	What else could we expect?
4016008	eng	Do you understand what's expected?
4016016	eng	Do you get enough exercise?
4016019	eng	I'm sick of your excuses.
4016020	eng	It's really kind of exciting.
4016023	eng	What does that mean exactly?
4016025	eng	What is Tom's job exactly?
4016031	eng	There was broken glass everywhere.
4016033	eng	Why shouldn't we take everything?
4016034	eng	There's a reason for everything.
4016038	eng	What's the matter with everybody?
4016043	eng	It was a wonderful evening.
4016049	eng	There's still time to evacuate.
4016050	eng	Tom inherited his uncle's estate.
4016051	eng	Were you trying to escape?
4016057	eng	Tom hasn't been eating enough.
4016058	eng	Is three hundred dollars enough?
4016066	eng	It's kind of an emergency.
4016068	eng	Perhaps you should go elsewhere.
4016072	eng	Was Tom carrying anything else?
4016073	eng	Did you see anything else?
4016074	eng	Did you find anything else?
4016078	eng	What's wrong with the elevator?
4016080	eng	Why does water conduct electricity?
4016082	eng	Would you care to elaborate?
4016085	eng	What else did you eat?
4016091	eng	This is almost too easy.
4016094	eng	It hasn't always been easy.
4016095	eng	It couldn't have been easy.
4016098	eng	Does it ever get easier?
4016100	eng	That felt like an earthquake.
4016106	eng	Aren't you a little early?
4016110	eng	Never argue with a drunk.
4016115	eng	Tom didn't want to drive.
4016120	eng	How often do you drink?
4016121	eng	What else did you drink?
4016129	eng	I don't drink carbonated drinks.
4016139	eng	Tom rummaged through the drawer.
4016143	eng	What precisely did you do?
4016145	eng	Are you writing this down?
4016148	eng	Would you please slow down?
4016149	eng	All right, let's settle down.
4016151	eng	Perhaps you should lie down.
4016152	eng	Maybe you should lie down.
4016153	eng	The party is dying down.
4016154	eng	The fire is dying down.
4016157	eng	Could you please calm down?
4016159	eng	Maybe Tom's car broke down.
4016205	eng	What's that supposed to do?
4016207	eng	What's Tom supposed to do?
4016268	eng	That's what Tom should do.
4016272	eng	It's what rich people do.
4016275	eng	Would you open the door?
4016276	eng	Shouldn't we lock the door?
4016277	eng	Could you close the door?
4016282	eng	Somebody knocked on the door.
4016285	eng	Thanks for opening the door.
4016286	eng	Get away from that door.
4016287	eng	What would you normally do?
4016295	eng	What would Tom have done?
4016300	eng	There's work to be done.
4016305	eng	What does this machine do?
4016313	eng	What precisely are you doing?
4016315	eng	What exactly are we doing?
4016320	eng	What exactly was Tom doing?
4016347	eng	I've always wanted a dog.
4016352	eng	Are you a real doctor?
4016372	eng	That's why we got divorced.
4016375	eng	This is all very disturbing.
4016384	eng	Are you experiencing any discomfort?
4016396	eng	Thanks so much for dinner.
4016402	eng	Are you in any difficulty?
4016403	eng	That wouldn't be too difficult.
4016404	eng	It wouldn't be too difficult.
4016405	eng	That shouldn't be too difficult.
4016406	eng	It really wasn't that difficult.
4016409	eng	That shouldn't be so difficult.
4016414	eng	Did you expect something different?
4016417	eng	Do you feel any different?
4016419	eng	That wouldn't make much difference.
4016420	eng	Does it make any difference?
4016422	eng	That wouldn't make any difference.
4016423	eng	It wouldn't make any difference.
4016453	eng	It's difficult to remember details.
4016458	eng	Are you ready for dessert?
4016460	eng	Help me move this desk.
4016473	eng	There's only one possible decision.
4016475	eng	Tom didn't like our decision.
4016476	eng	It was a mutual decision.
4016477	eng	This isn't an easy decision.
4016478	eng	It was a difficult decision.
4016479	eng	It was a controversial decision.
4016480	eng	Have you reached a decision?
4016485	eng	It's not open for debate.
4016487	eng	All right, here's the deal.
4016500	eng	It's only been three days.
4016520	eng	It's been a difficult day.
4016532	eng	It's starting to get dark.
4016538	eng	There were no other customers.
4016542	eng	All the children started crying.
4016549	eng	Are you all completely crazy?
4016551	eng	No one survived the crash.
4016570	eng	Are you going to cooperate?
4016572	eng	Isn't that kind of cool?
4016576	eng	Tom named his cat Cookie.
4016578	eng	Is it all under control?
4016579	eng	Is that the remote control?
4016581	eng	Tom didn't win the contest.
4016583	eng	It was a friendly contest.
4016586	eng	Did Tom ever regain consciousness?
4016595	eng	Did you enjoy the concert?
4016600	eng	There's no cause for concern.
4016601	eng	There's no need for concern.
4016602	eng	What's wrong with my computer?
4016606	eng	It shouldn't be too complicated.
4016609	eng	It's not really a competition.
4016612	eng	What crimes have you committed?
4016613	eng	Who's the second in command?
4016614	eng	What time is Tom coming?
4016615	eng	How are the repairs coming?
4016619	eng	Thanks so much for coming.
4016620	eng	This chair isn't very comfortable.
4016627	eng	Thanks for agreeing to come.
4016631	eng	It's really not that cold.
4016633	eng	Tom picked up the coins.
4016636	eng	It's probably just a coincidence.
4016644	eng	That can't be a coincidence.
4016645	eng	It can't be a coincidence.
4016652	eng	Have another cup of coffee.
4016655	eng	It really smells like coffee.
4016659	eng	Tom put on his coat.
4016663	eng	Tom found a four-leaf clover.
4016672	eng	All the stores were closed.
4016673	eng	Why is the store closed?
4016675	eng	Why's the bedroom door closed?
4016676	eng	Why was the door closed?
4016677	eng	All the stores are closed.
4016702	eng	What are your top choices?
4016703	eng	What are your other choices?
4016713	eng	It's a game for children.
4016717	eng	Have you tried the chicken?
4016733	eng	Who put you in charge?
4016735	eng	Who's the person in charge?
4016736	eng	It was a little chaotic.
4016738	eng	It seems to have changed.
4016742	eng	There'll be no second chances.
4016747	eng	It was a lovely ceremony.
4016761	eng	What's wrong with your car?
4016767	eng	Who was driving the car?
4016781	eng	Tom bought an expensive car.
4016792	eng	Tom doesn't need a cane.
4016793	eng	Here's a piece of candy.
4016799	eng	All right, everyone, remain calm.
4016801	eng	It was a judgment call.
4016806	eng	What are those pills called?
4016812	eng	What else did you buy?
4016816	eng	Do you like peanut butter?
4016821	eng	It's none of our business.
4016826	eng	That'll cost three hundred bucks.
4016842	eng	It's getting harder to breathe.
4016844	eng	Come on, let's get breakfast.
4016847	eng	Tom often jogs before breakfast.
4016861	eng	Maybe we should go bowling.
4016885	eng	Tom is now in Boston.
4016907	eng	Actually, it was pretty boring.
4016912	eng	Tom bought me this book.
4016917	eng	Perhaps I'll write a book.
4016918	eng	Maybe I'll write a book.
4016919	eng	It was a suicide bombing.
4016920	eng	There could be another bomb.
4016926	eng	That's a very pretty blouse.
4016952	eng	This'll make you feel better.
4016956	eng	Where's it supposed to be?
4016957	eng	What's that supposed to be?
4016958	eng	Where's Tom supposed to be?
4016978	eng	What else could there be?
4016989	eng	That's pretty hard to believe.
4016990	eng	It seems hard to believe.
4016994	eng	How important can it be?
4016995	eng	How hard could it be?
4016996	eng	How complicated could it be?
4016997	eng	Why not leave it behind?
4016998	eng	Did Tom leave anything behind?
4017010	eng	Is it worse than before?
4017014	eng	Haven't we met somewhere before?
4017024	eng	It's the same as before.
4017026	eng	Is there any more beer?
4017028	eng	Everyone else is drinking beer.
4017047	eng	This place is really beautiful.
4017049	eng	How badly was Tom beaten?
4017055	eng	That's not my baseball bat.
4017060	eng	Tom wasn't interested in baseball.
4017062	eng	Tom almost lost his balance.
4017068	eng	It's really not too bad.
4017069	eng	Is it really that bad?
4017070	eng	It's really not that bad.
4017071	eng	Maybe it's not that bad.
4017073	eng	This place isn't so bad.
4017081	eng	Maybe we should turn back.
4017085	eng	Thanks for calling me back.
4017088	eng	Why isn't Tom fighting back?
4017104	eng	It's about three meters away.
4017111	eng	Are fireworks legal in Australia?
4017116	eng	May I have your attention?
4017117	eng	Let me have your attention.
4017118	eng	Haven't you been paying attention?
4017119	eng	What church do you attend?
4017122	eng	Are they planning an attack?
4017131	eng	The children are upstairs asleep.
4017133	eng	Try not to fall asleep.
4017139	eng	This is a fascinating article.
4017147	eng	There's no time to argue.

4499001	eng	You went to Harvard, right?
4499003	eng	Tom is the easy-going sort.
4499005	eng	Nobody knew where Tom went.
4499013	eng	We're going to visit Tom.
4499014	eng	Tom went to Mary's house.
4499021	eng	I went to public school.
4499023	eng	Tom insisted that I go.
4499031	eng	Let's all go to Tom's.
4499067	eng	The government took our land.
4499072	eng	Tom is a Harvard graduate.
4499081	eng	What was that groan for?
4499093	eng	I guess everyone was lying.
4499110	eng	Tom was convicted and hanged.
4499146	eng	That actually happened three times.
4499147	eng	Sometimes really bad things happen.
4499153	eng	Tom predicted this would happen.
4499160	eng	That's not likely to happen.
4499163	eng	I thought that might happen.
4499164	eng	Tom said that won't happen.
4499174	eng	That happened to me twice.
4499190	eng	That happened a week ago.
4499289	eng	Preheat the oven to 300°F.
4499299	eng	Everybody should help each other.
4499305	eng	This medicine seems to help.
4499311	eng	Those kids need our help.
4499314	eng	They offered to help us.
4499318	eng	Tom said he would help.
4499321	eng	Tom will want to help.
4499343	eng	Tom helps me a lot.
4499369	eng	Everybody has something to hide.
4499380	eng	Both songs were big hits.
4499401	eng	I hope Tom recovers quickly.
4499403	eng	I hope everyone is happy.
4499404	eng	I hope everyone is safe.
4499406	eng	I hope everyone is OK.
4499407	eng	We have to have hope.
4499408	eng	See you soon, I hope.
4499430	eng	I'm glad you weren't hurt.
4499556	eng	I have three unpublished manuscripts.
4499593	eng	Recently, I started smoking again.
4499597	eng	Christmas is my favorite holiday.
4499601	eng	This one's my personal favorite.
4499606	eng	I'm allergic to cigarette smoke.
4499615	eng	The doctor treated my shoulder.
4499620	eng	I'm looking forward to tonight.
4499622	eng	I won't retract that statement.
4499629	eng	I quarreled with Tom yesterday.
4499633	eng	I have won several tournaments.
4499636	eng	Tom sure impressed my parents.
4499639	eng	My favorite sport is baseball.
4499640	eng	I've already read this report.
4499644	eng	I just noticed something else.
4499645	eng	I've worked with Tom before.
4499650	eng	That's not really my problem.
4499654	eng	My watch has stopped working.
4499655	eng	I've already seen this movie.
4499656	eng	I'm parked across the street.
4499664	eng	My name's Tom. What's yours?
4499666	eng	I'm thrilled the Giants won.
4499671	eng	I really liked this article.
4499672	eng	I purchased Tom's new novel.
4499677	eng	Everyone I know uses Google.
4499679	eng	Tom owes me thirty dollars.
4499701	eng	I haven't learned much yet.
4499702	eng	I actually like modern art.
4499704	eng	My cousins live in Boston.
4499705	eng	I'm a freshman at Harvard.
4499708	eng	I talked to Tom's parents.
4499709	eng	I might have already paid.
4499717	eng	Why shouldn't I be happy?
4499718	eng	Tom still has my bicycle.
4499719	eng	Tom and I train together.
4499721	eng	That sounds racist to me.
4499722	eng	That seems logical to me.
4499727	eng	I won't be there tonight.
4499730	eng	I was impressed with Tom.
4499739	eng	I saw Tom standing there.
4499740	eng	I saw Tom here yesterday.
4499742	eng	I played tennis with Tom.
4499747	eng	I have a 13-year-old son.
4499753	eng	My last name is Jackson.
4499760	eng	I'll write Tom a letter.
4499762	eng	I watched the game live.
4499763	eng	I was scared, of course.
4499777	eng	I love being at Harvard.
4499780	eng	I invited Tom to dinner.
4499782	eng	I have a silly question.
4499786	eng	Tom stayed at my house.
4499789	eng	Tom mistook me for you.
4499793	eng	That seems legit to me.
4499794	eng	That seems crazy to me.
4499799	eng	I'm a sailor, you know.
4499809	eng	I was nervous at first.
4499814	eng	I was a public servant.
4499817	eng	I use Google every day.
4499833	eng	I have to be impartial.
4499839	eng	Tom and I are buddies.
4499844	eng	That seems fair to me.
4499850	eng	I'm in pain every day.
4499860	eng	I was at that meeting.
4499872	eng	I liked what Tom said.
4499876	eng	I have jeans on today.
4499880	eng	Who should I talk to?
4499881	eng	Tom is staring at me.
4499884	eng	That was naive of me.
4499892	eng	My dad's name is Tom.
4499895	eng	I'm in love with Tom.
4499940	eng	Can I speak with Tom?
4499943	eng	Tom said I was rude.
4499977	eng	I have to have that.
4500011	eng	I used to love Tom.
4500012	eng	I used to like Tom.
4500015	eng	I see it every day.
4500019	eng	I saw Tom and Mary.
4500043	eng	Hi, my name is Tom.
4500068	eng	I was a shy child.
4500095	eng	I have it with me.
4500119	eng	I was on the bus.
4500155	eng	I had to see Tom.
4500200	eng	That's a pretty impressive list.
4500201	eng	What was your first impression?
4500203	eng	Tom was impressed with that.
4500210	eng	Tom is impressed as well.
4500226	eng	Tom has started to improve.
4500240	eng	Tax and gratuity aren't included.
4500241	eng	Why shouldn't that be included?
4500246	eng	It was a huge increase.
4500261	eng	Most passengers were hardly injured.
4500263	eng	No police officers were injured.
4500266	eng	No injuries have been reported.
4500269	eng	Tom and Mary weren't injured.
4500273	eng	Only one person was injured.
4500304	eng	Tom installed a surveillance camera.
4500306	eng	Is it easy to install?
4500311	eng	The pain was very intense.
4500314	eng	That actually sounds quite interesting.
4500315	eng	Tom's speech was really interesting.
4500336	eng	The police are interviewing witnesses.
4500337	eng	Tom is intimidated by Mary.
4500343	eng	The complaint is under investigation.
4500356	eng	Why were only students invited?
4500374	eng	Everybody jumped into the pool.
4500375	eng	Tom jumped off the pier.
4500381	eng	Promises have to be kept.
4500406	eng	Hundreds of animals were killed.
4500418	eng	Tom is on pain killers.
4500428	eng	Who's knocking on the door?
4500445	eng	Nobody knew where Tom lived.
4500449	eng	Nobody knew where Tom was.
4500454	eng	Tom knew what Mary liked.
4500520	eng	Tom had surgery last Monday.
4500521	eng	The snow started last night.
4500527	eng	The tall man laughed obnoxiously.
4500531	eng	Tom laughed and Mary giggled.
4500542	eng	The probe launch was successful.
4500543	eng	That headline was extremely misleading.
4500548	eng	Can Tom retake the lead?
4500558	eng	Tom learned French very quickly.
4500559	eng	Learning a language takes time.
4500560	eng	What have you learned, Tom?
4500568	eng	We want everybody to leave.
4500578	eng	We probably should've left earlier.
4500580	eng	Thousands have been left homeless.
4500581	eng	We probably should've left early.
4500583	eng	Tom left early Monday morning.
4500585	eng	The doors were left unlocked.
4500586	eng	Tom left school at thirteen.
4500587	eng	There's plenty of time left.
4500602	eng	Let's talk about somebody else.
4500605	eng	Let's stop talking about this.
4500608	eng	Let's listen to some jazz.
4500616	eng	That sounds like another lie.
4500620	eng	Shame on you for lying.
4500621	eng	This is a blatant lie.
4500639	eng	This detergent works like magic.
4500640	eng	That sounded like an explosion.
4500642	eng	It was almost like Christmas.
4500645	eng	Those girls look like guys.
4500651	eng	Tom slept like a baby.
4500678	eng	Thank you for the link.
4500683	eng	Tom is on the list.
4500704	eng	Where are they living now?
4500705	eng	Tom still lives in Boston.
4500717	eng	The policeman unlocked Tom's handcuffs.
4500722	eng	Click here to log in.
4500730	eng	This is a long-standing problem.
4500733	eng	Tom no longer trusts anyone.
4500734	eng	The meeting was long today.
4500735	eng	The wait was too long.
4500748	eng	You'd better take another look.
4500751	eng	Tom's children all look alike.
4500753	eng	Everyone but Tom looked happy.
4500754	eng	Tom looks really goofy today.
4500764	eng	What are they looking at?
4500766	eng	Tom looked at the poster.
4500816	eng	People are losing their jobs.
4500817	eng	Many people lost their jobs.
4500818	eng	Tom has lost his umbrella.
4500898	eng	Prices are lower in Boston.
4500908	eng	Tom made some derogatory remarks.
4500909	eng	You're just making things worse.
4500916	eng	The situation made Tom uneasy.
4500918	eng	That might make matters worse.
4500919	eng	People often make bad choices.
4500921	eng	That makes a big difference.
4500922	eng	Tom has made some mistakes.
4500924	eng	No decision has been made.
4500970	eng	Tom is a smart man.
4500975	eng	Pain management is the priority.
4500985	eng	Tom was married to Mary.
4500993	eng	This is a trivial matter.
4501016	eng	The meeting has been postponed.
4501017	eng	The meeting has been canceled.
4501018	eng	Have you already met Tom?
4501030	eng	Is this milk still good?
4501042	eng	Tom said Mary was mistaken.
4501043	eng	This is a grievous mistake.
4501046	eng	Boy, was that a mistake.
4501065	eng	Was that a smart move?
4501067	eng	It was a prudent move.
4501070	eng	It was a smart move.
4501082	eng	They named their dog Cookie.
4501091	eng	The children need adult supervision.
4501095	eng	Our magazine need better writers.
4501101	eng	Tom needs to quit worrying.
4501103	eng	You need to trust someone.
4501124	eng	We need all the facts.
4501156	eng	We need a new rug.
4501173	eng	You can't negotiate with terrorists.
4501176	eng	Tom nodded with a smile.
4501201	eng	The defense attorney immediately objected.
4501232	eng	Traveling on business is stressful.
4501241	eng	Tom was convicted on Monday.
4501244	eng	Tom elaborated on the point.
4501245	eng	What's on the agenda today?
4501246	eng	There's trash on the floor.
4501247	eng	Lifeguards are now on duty.
4501248	eng	Everything is on the table.
4501252	eng	Can you elaborate on that?
4501253	eng	Tickets are on sale now.
4501254	eng	Tickets are now on sale.
4501255	eng	Were you on the train?

4501261	eng	Tom was on that team.
4501264	eng	Tom was on that bus.
4501265	eng	Tom is on the wagon.
4501286	eng	The door suddenly swung open.
4501301	eng	Evacuation orders have been issued.
4501305	eng	Tom always seems so disorganized.
4501326	eng	The paint is still wet.
4501333	eng	We talked about Park Street.
4501336	eng	These two parts are interchangeable.
4501337	eng	That was the scary part.
4501377	eng	It was a perfect day.
4501394	eng	The photo was a hoax.
4501400	eng	Tom pitched a tremendous game.
4501411	eng	See you at Tom's place.
4501413	eng	It was a scary place.
4501428	eng	Luckily, we have a plan.
4501429	eng	You have a plan, right?
4501437	eng	Tom will have a plan.
4501460	eng	Our team played extremely well.
4501463	eng	Can you still play tennis?
4501466	eng	Tom plays the piano well.
4501467	eng	Where can the kids play?
4501479	eng	It wasn't a pleasant experience.
4501480	eng	Please shut the door quietly.
4501489	eng	It's hard to please Tom.
4501502	eng	Everyone posed for a picture.
4501511	eng	Tom shouldn't be practicing medicine.
4501513	eng	Are you a practicing physician?
4501547	eng	Tom Jackson is the producer.
4501550	eng	It was a huge project.
4501569	eng	Nothing has been proven yet.
4501579	eng	Tom pulled Mary to safety.
4501582	eng	Tom has to be punished.
4501591	eng	Who put together this schedule?
4501600	eng	That was a stupid question.
4501615	eng	It was rainy that day.
4501619	eng	It's not easy raising children.
4501672	eng	The registration deadline is tomorrow.
4501698	eng	Tom took the rejection hard.
4501703	eng	Are you in a relationship?
4501704	eng	Are Tom and Mary related?
4501708	eng	Three hostages have been released.
4501712	eng	All the cabins remain shuttered.
4501713	eng	A few serious problems remain.
4501717	eng	Tom tried to remain calm.
4501746	eng	No casualties have been reported.
4501747	eng	When was the theft reported?
4501748	eng	Thank you for this report.
4501763	eng	Not much money is required.
4501765	eng	Not much time is required.
4501784	eng	The president's car is bulletproof.
4501785	eng	Tom currently resides in Boston.
4501793	eng	The problem has been resolved.
4501822	eng	Tom retired October 20, 2013.
4501823	eng	Tom said he was retiring.
4501847	eng	The front doorbell just rang.
4501848	eng	Tom pawned his wedding ring.
4501862	eng	Some people started throwing rocks.
4501868	eng	Medical supplies are running out.
4501871	eng	Tom ran three miles today.
4501872	eng	The movie ran 85 minutes.
4501875	eng	Tom ran up the hill.
4501883	eng	Customers have to be satisfied.
4501885	eng	It was a satisfying meal.
4501888	eng	You should savor this moment.
4501904	eng	Tom shouldn't have said anything.
4501910	eng	Tom said he was disoriented.
4501911	eng	Tom said it wasn't serious.
4501912	eng	Tom said he wasn't worried.
4501915	eng	Tom said it wasn't funny.

4501937	eng	Tom wasn't scared of anything.
4501940	eng	Why were you so scared?
4501942	eng	It was a scary moment.
4501947	eng	The team's schedule is grueling.
4501955	eng	All the women were screaming.
4501956	eng	Tom and Mary are screaming.
4501967	eng	Tom, you should see this.
4501978	eng	People seem more serious nowadays.
4501981	eng	Tom always seems stressed out.
4501982	eng	Tom seems happier than usual.
4501983	eng	This seems kind of expensive.
4501986	eng	Tom seems busier than usual.
4501993	eng	You seem to be overworked.
4502008	eng	You seem to be hungry.
4502044	eng	Nothing has been sold yet.
4502047	eng	Tom sent Mary some money.
4502048	eng	Why was Tom sent home?
4502060	eng	Lunch is served at noon.
4502078	eng	That was a horrible shock.
4502089	eng	Tom shot Mary in self-defense.
4502116	eng	The bed was too short.
4502125	eng	The show starts at 2:30.
4502133	eng	Tom eventually signed the document.
4502134	eng	That's a very positive sign.
4502139	eng	It's simple, but it works.
4502140	eng	That is simply not true.
4502161	eng	Just about everybody sat down.
4502166	eng	The situation was very unusual.
4502171	eng	This is a sticky situation.
4502172	eng	This is a no-win situation.
4502176	eng	It was a dire situation.
4502188	eng	There was a foul smell.
4502207	eng	This song sounds somewhat familiar.
4502208	eng	That really sounds quite awesome.
4502234	eng	Almost everyone here speaks French.
4502238	eng	Can you really speak French?
4502239	eng	Tom spoke to the crowd.
4502256	eng	Professional athletes spend hours training.
4502257	eng	Spending time together is important.
4502260	eng	We spent all day indoors.
4502267	eng	The children squealed with joy.
4502272	eng	Can you stand the pain?
4502281	eng	People have started arming themselves.
4502283	eng	Tom started cursing in French.
4502284	eng	The movie has already started.
4502285	eng	We start classes next Monday.
4502286	eng	The game has already started.
4502290	eng	Dinner starts at 6:00 p.m.
4502300	eng	The loud noise startled Tom.
4502303	eng	You should definitely stay overnight.
4502310	eng	We stayed for three nights.
4502314	eng	Tom and Mary are staying.
4502317	eng	Tom stayed for a while.
4502327	eng	Tom had his camera stolen.
4502332	eng	Tom took another step forward.
4502336	eng	Tom stuck his tongue out.
4502342	eng	The machine has stopped functioning.
4502344	eng	The machine has stopped working.
4502349	eng	Why can't they be stopped?
4502368	eng	We have 13 retail stores.
4502378	eng	Tom is studying right now.
4502379	eng	Tom is studying in Boston.
4502393	eng	Tom tried, but was unsuccessful.
4502397	eng	The surgery was a success.
4502410	eng	What you're suggesting is stupid.
4502427	eng	Tom is supposedly very wealthy.
4502438	eng	Why were you so surprised?
4502440	eng	Well, this is a surprise.
4502442	eng	It wasn't a big surprise.
4502457	eng	The soldiers surrounded the village.
4502468	eng	The police have no suspects.
4502475	eng	Tom can swim quite well.
4502482	eng	Tom took these pictures himself.
4502484	eng	The sedative is taking effect.
4502486	eng	Would you take that away?
4502489	eng	Tom took three days off.
4502502	eng	It took them a while.
4502528	eng	We never talked about religion.
4502529	eng	We never talked about money.
4502542	eng	Tom tapped his fingers impatiently.
4502543	eng	Wrap tape around the pipe.
4502551	eng	Tom is a kindergarten teacher.
4502552	eng	Who will teach our children?
4502564	eng	Tell the cops the truth.
4502576	eng	The test was real easy.
4502579	eng	Thank you for the article.
4502582	eng	Thank you for the update.
4502593	eng	Tom thought Mary was exaggerating.
4502596	eng	That's wishful thinking at best.
4502597	eng	Tom is having second thoughts.
4502598	eng	Here's some food for thought.
4502599	eng	Some people might think so.
4502629	eng	It's a full-time, year-around job.
4502635	eng	You'll have a marvelous time.
4502636	eng	There's still plenty of time.
4502638	eng	Tom was flogged three times.
4502642	eng	Is now an appropriate time?
4502645	eng	Tom was stabbed 13 times.
4502646	eng	They have plenty of time.
4502662	eng	Tom must be tired now.
4502665	eng	The scene was quite touching.
4502671	eng	How would you translate this?
4502672	eng	How would you translate it?
4502673	eng	Tom works as a translator.
4502675	eng	Have you traveled anywhere recently?
4502681	eng	That was a lousy trick.
4502685	eng	Tom has trouble understanding French.
4502689	eng	Should we really trust them?
4502701	eng	Tom tried to be neutral.
4502702	eng	At least we should try.
4502703	eng	We have to try harder.
4502709	eng	The television is turned off.
4502730	eng	This is a huge undertaking.
4502735	eng	Why was Tom so upset?
4502747	eng	We used to be neighbors.
4502768	eng	All our members are volunteers.
4502770	eng	Tom and Mary were volunteers.
4502774	eng	They all voted for Tom.
4502785	eng	Several people are already waiting.
4502786	eng	This can't wait until tomorrow.
4502789	eng	Is someone waiting for you?

4502871	eng	Tom whistled through his teeth.
4502880	eng	We won't tolerate any looting.
4502882	eng	That still won't be enough.
4502883	eng	Everyone can't be a winner.
4502884	eng	Now, this won't be easy.
4502931	eng	Fewer teenagers are working nowadays.
4502938	eng	Tom works as a journalist.
4502992	eng	Tom often worries about money.
4503005	eng	This is a well-written article.
4503006	eng	Tom wrote some country songs.
4503008	eng	Tom is a freelance writer.
4503435	eng	Was it just a misunderstanding?
4503445	eng	The box was completely sealed.
4503483	eng	We soon moved in together.
4503980	eng	Do you need help moving?
4503985	eng	I also contacted the police.
4503996	eng	My grandfather was pretty tall.
4504147	eng	No one likes a braggart.

4504994	eng	They won't accept the gifts.
4505039	eng	We stretched out our arms.
4505530	eng	Who is worried about Tom?
4505624	eng	I can hear you well.
4505815	eng	A man's penis controls him.
4505825	eng	There is a meeting tomorrow.
4506151	eng	Doing this is not good.
4506181	eng	Where is the gas station?

4511826	eng	What's wrong with that woman?
4511827	eng	This conversation is over. Bye.
4512121	eng	We stayed there all night.
4512162	eng	Her brother was probably abducted.
4512190	eng	The conversation got more personal.
4512205	eng	She found a new roommate.
4512496	eng	She had an easy-going personality.
4512503	eng	Her kids are in bed.
4512514	eng	She wanted to have fun.

4513694	eng	She was talented and smart.
4513734	eng	She wanted her children back.
4513739	eng	You like to hurt people.

4513789	eng	She was still a virgin.
4513792	eng	She had an abusive mother.
4513813	eng	She drove toward her home.
4513883	eng	She politely declined the invitation.
4514770	eng	That man knew too much.
4514775	eng	It turned out all right.
4514784	eng	I don't believe that story.

4515246	eng	What is a planetary year?
4515599	eng	She threatened to kill him.
4515601	eng	She wasn't looking for love.
4515602	eng	She fell hard for him.
4515603	eng	She wanted to go out.
4515604	eng	He lavished her with attention.

4515666	eng	She was overcome with emotion.
4515725	eng	She survived an abusive childhood.

4519849	eng	She had a questionable past.
4519858	eng	She introduced herself to them.
4519864	eng	She left him in peace.
4519875	eng	She seemed to like him.
4519879	eng	She took two steps back.
4519885	eng	She was a likely suspect.
4519891	eng	She was having her period.
4519892	eng	She was his new girlfriend.
4519898	eng	They talked throughout the night.
4519924	eng	I want to learn Arabic.

4524077	eng	I can't believe he's single.
4524325	eng	Are you going home now?
4524861	eng	This food is very sweet.
4525603	eng	What happened? You look pale.
4526473	eng	Are you saying I'm impolite?
4526569	eng	Why do it this way?
4526769	eng	Tom joined a political party.
4526771	eng	Can I come in now?
4526785	eng	Go on, Tom, I'm listening.
4526786	eng	Go on, Tom, we're listening.
4526850	eng	You like cats, don't you?
4527217	eng	This food truly is tasty.
4528805	eng	It seems I've offended you.

4529157	eng	They appointed Tom administrative director.
4529161	eng	Motorists should anticipate traffic delays.
4529171	eng	Commuters should anticipate traffic delays.
4529192	eng	Additional details weren't made available.
4529199	eng	Tom's appearance is noticeably different.
4529202	eng	Tom only accepted partial responsibility.
4529205	eng	The arrangement proved highly profitable.
4529207	eng	The allegations are completely unfounded.
4529215	eng	You've assessed the situation perfectly.
4529219	eng	Violence against anyone is unacceptable.
4529220	eng	Tom's achievements speak for themselves.
4529227	eng	They're quite disagreeable, aren't they?
4529229	eng	No additional information was available.
4529237	eng	After careful consideration, Tom agreed.
4529241	eng	We're approaching the rendezvous point.
4529247	eng	The landlord promised immediate action.
4529260	eng	I definitely appreciate receiving this.
4529264	eng	We really appreciated everyone's help.

4529270	eng	Tom vehemently denied the accusations.
4529275	eng	Tom called the accusations ridiculous.
4529277	eng	Those questions haven't been answered.
4529278	eng	They apologized for the inconvenience.
4529282	eng	That's really quite an accomplishment.
4529284	eng	People act without thinking sometimes.
4529285	eng	Parents must accompany their children.
4529290	eng	Aren't there any qualified applicants?
4529293	eng	We'll definitely achieve these goals.
4529299	eng	Tom's constant complaining annoys me.
4529307	eng	Tom frequently appears on television.
4529308	eng	Tom did acknowledge feeling relieved.
4529310	eng	There were some unexpected questions.
4529312	eng	The school administration blamed Tom.
4529321	eng	Church leaders denied the accusation.
4529322	eng	Your support is greatly appreciated.
4529328	eng	Words can't express my appreciation.
4529331	eng	What has violence ever accomplished?
4529332	eng	We're not anticipating any violence.
4529335	eng	We get applications from everywhere.
4529336	eng	We don't accept emailed submissions.
4529337	eng	We couldn't allow any interruptions.
4529338	eng	We apologize for this inconvenience.
4529348	eng	Tom is an administrative supervisor.
4529351	eng	Tom has accepted Mary's resignation.
4529362	eng	There's nothing we can't accomplish.
4529364	eng	The company didn't admit wrongdoing.
4529365	eng	The audience applauded and whistled.
4529367	eng	That's a very important achievement.
4529368	eng	That was our biggest accomplishment.
4529369	eng	Smoking and drinking aren't allowed.
4529374	eng	It was an understandable accusation.
4529380	eng	Arrangements have already been made.
4529381	eng	Applications are now being accepted.
4529382	eng	Applications are being accepted now.
4529383	eng	You're acting very strange tonight.
4529385	eng	We didn't anticipate your interest.
4529387	eng	Tom's injury didn't appear serious.
4529393	eng	Tom gladly accepted the invitation.
4529394	eng	Tom announced the agreement Monday.
4529395	eng	Tom agreed with Mary's suggestions.

4529402	eng	The activists deny the accusations.
4529403	eng	That seems a reasonable assumption.
4529404	eng	Please accept my heartfelt apology.
4529406	eng	Nominations are now being accepted.
4529415	eng	I've answered this question before.
4529416	eng	I'm proud of Tom's accomplishments.
4529420	eng	Exactly what's the accusation here?
4529423	eng	Your ideas are always appreciated.
4529424	eng	Your advice is highly appreciated.
4529428	eng	What are you really accomplishing?
4529429	eng	We're working on the arrangements.
4529431	eng	We're now assessing the situation.
4529435	eng	Tom graciously accepted the offer.
4529436	eng	Tom gave the commencement address.
4529440	eng	Tom announced his decision Monday.
4529441	eng	Tom agreed with Mary's assessment.
4529442	eng	Tom adopted Mary's three children.
4529444	eng	This is no trivial accomplishment.
4529445	eng	This is an unacceptable situation.
4529446	eng	They're alleging I bribed someone.
4529450	eng	The men achieved their objectives.
4529451	eng	The board gave unanimous approval.
4529452	eng	The answer was pretty astonishing.
4529456	eng	My parents are constantly arguing.
4529458	eng	Isn't that an amazing coincidence?
4529461	eng	I'm in absolutely total agreement.
4529464	eng	I whole-heartedly agree with this.
4529466	eng	I don't anticipate that happening.
4529467	eng	I didn't actually anticipate that.
4529468	eng	Counseling is by appointment only.
4529469	eng	Auditions are by appointment only.
4529471	eng	Applications are due October 20th.
4529473	eng	You've accomplished a great deal.
4529474	eng	You're both acting like children.
4529477	eng	We have achieved great successes.
4529478	eng	We accomplished some good things.
4529479	eng	Tom's question was an accusation.
4529480	eng	Tom would probably have approved.
4529486	eng	Tom seldom visits Boston anymore.
4529488	eng	Tom needed his parents' approval.
4529489	eng	Tom most certainly would approve.
4529490	eng	Tom made the announcement Monday.
4529491	eng	Tom has denied these accusations.
4529492	eng	Tom has announced his retirement.
4529495	eng	The enemy is approaching rapidly.
4529496	eng	The announcement was made Monday.
4529497	eng	That shouldn't have been allowed.
4529498	eng	Results will be announced Monday.
4529500	eng	Not every community was affected.
4529502	eng	Mental illness can affect anyone.
4529505	eng	It was an awesome accomplishment.
4529506	eng	Immediate action should be taken.
4529507	eng	I don't trust the administration.
4529508	eng	I can't afford another operation.
4529509	eng	I can understand Tom's annoyance.
4529510	eng	I agree with this wholeheartedly.
4529512	eng	Give the administration a chance.
4529515	eng	Appropriate action is needed now.
4529516	eng	An announcement is expected soon.
4529519	eng	You should've apologized to Tom.
4529521	eng	What exactly did you anticipate?
4529522	eng	What can hunger strikes achieve?
4529523	eng	We've made arrangements for you.
4529525	eng	We should offer them assistance.
4529527	eng	We appreciated your helping out.
4529528	eng	Tom's disease affects his sleep.
4529531	eng	Tom was arrested Monday evening.
4529535	eng	Tom still hasn't abandoned hope.
4529538	eng	Tom refused to answer questions.
4529539	eng	Tom politely accepted the drink.

4529546	eng	Tom apologized to his teammates.
4529547	eng	Tom apologized for upsetting me.
4529548	eng	Tom apologized for the incident.
4529549	eng	Tom answered in the affirmative.
4529552	eng	Three people have been arrested.
4529553	eng	This is a wonderful achievement.
4529554	eng	This approach has worked before.
4529555	eng	The first goal seems achievable.
4529556	eng	The arrangements have been made.
4529557	eng	That's a very unfair assessment.
4529559	eng	Officially, we don't allow that.
4529561	eng	Look at all you've accomplished.
4529563	eng	It's been an amazing experience.
4529565	eng	I'm taking a different approach.
4529571	eng	I disagree with Tom's statement.
4529572	eng	I completely disagree with that.
4529573	eng	How many students were affected?
4529575	eng	Could somebody please answer me?
4529576	eng	Cash donations will be accepted.
4529577	eng	Around 300 people were arrested.
4529578	eng	All the proposals were accepted.
4529579	eng	Agreements need to be respected.
4529580	eng	Admission is free for residents.
4529581	eng	Admission is by invitation only.
4529583	eng	A unanimous agreement is needed.
4529585	eng	You should follow Tom's advice.
4529586	eng	What we found was unacceptable.
4529590	eng	We're proud of our achievement.
4529591	eng	We really appreciate your help.
4529592	eng	We never had any disagreements.
4529593	eng	We have three adopted children.
4529594	eng	Tom's acceptance speech was OK.
4529597	eng	Tom says that isn't acceptable.
4529598	eng	Tom remains under house arrest.
4529599	eng	Tom readily accepted the offer.
4529600	eng	Tom looked around in amazement.
4529603	eng	Tom has denied the allegations.
4529604	eng	Tom has denied the accusations.
4529605	eng	Tom has denied that allegation.
4529608	eng	Tom has admitted no wrongdoing.
4529610	eng	Tom had denied the allegations.
4529611	eng	Tom gave no additional details.
4529613	eng	Tom apologized for his actions.
4529614	eng	Tom advised against doing that.
4529616	eng	This wasn't an easy assignment.
4529617	eng	This new technology is amazing.
4529618	eng	They have already been alerted.
4529619	eng	The accused remains in custody.
4529621	eng	That's a pretty big assumption.
4529622	eng	That was an amazing experience.
4529623	eng	Surprisingly, I agree with Tom.
4529625	eng	People always assume the worst.
4529626	eng	Parking and admission are free.
4529628	eng	Neither goal has been achieved.
4529629	eng	Mary is an extraordinary woman.
4529630	eng	It's actually kind of annoying.
4529631	eng	It's a very serious allegation.
4529632	eng	It works exactly as advertised.
4529634	eng	It might affect our friendship.
4529635	eng	I've already apologized to Tom.
4529636	eng	I'm sure they'll appreciate it.
4529640	eng	How unappreciative can you get?
4529642	eng	Everybody came to an agreement.
4529643	eng	Entries are now being accepted.
4529644	eng	Do you smell something burning?
4529645	eng	Board members adopted the plan.
4529647	eng	Are you saying it's acceptable?
4529648	eng	Applications are due by Monday.
4529649	eng	Allow three weeks for delivery.
4529650	eng	All students are admitted free.
4529651	eng	About 300 people were arrested.
4529652	eng	Would that be more acceptable?
4529654	eng	We're not asking for anything.
4529656	eng	We need more trade agreements.
4529659	eng	Tom's answer was very evasive.
4529660	eng	Tom's answer may surprise you.
4529661	eng	Tom was arrested Monday night.
4529662	eng	Tom often does volunteer work.
4529663	eng	Tom might know Mary's address.
4529664	eng	Tom made all the arrangements.
4529666	eng	Tom is an accomplished artist.
4529667	eng	Tom is Mary's adopted brother.
4529668	eng	Tom has denied the allegation.
4529669	eng	Tom has been acting strangely.
4529671	eng	Tom has admitted his mistakes.
4529672	eng	Tom doesn't want to apologize.
4529673	eng	Tom didn't sign the agreement.
4529674	eng	Tom assured us he'd cooperate.
4529676	eng	Tom apologized over the phone.
4529677	eng	Tom answered his own question.
4529678	eng	Tom acknowledges it's not fun.
4529679	eng	Tom acknowledged he was upset.
4529680	eng	Today, you might get arrested.
4529681	eng	This method has worked before.
4529682	eng	This is the usual arrangement.
4529683	eng	There's a lot of anticipation.
4529684	eng	Their accusations may be true.
4529685	eng	The commission took no action.
4529686	eng	That's no reason to apologize.
4529687	eng	That was a big accomplishment.
4529688	eng	Tell Tom this is unacceptable.
4529689	eng	Some people might assume that.
4529690	eng	Over 300 people were arrested.
4529691	eng	OK, let's assume you're right.
4529692	eng	Not everyone agrees with that.
4529693	eng	No arrests have been reported.
4529694	eng	My prayers have been answered.
4529695	eng	Mr. Jackson teaches us French.
4529696	eng	Most people won't be affected.
4529697	eng	Look, I'm trying to apologize.
4529699	eng	It was a great accomplishment.
4529702	eng	I strongly disagree with this.
4529706	eng	How will that be accomplished?
4529709	eng	Does that answer the question?
4529711	eng	Did that answer your question?
4529713	eng	Any help would be appreciated.
4529715	eng	You've done an admirable job.
4529716	eng	Would you accept those terms?
4529717	eng	Will I receive financial aid?
4529719	eng	What's that going to achieve?
4529721	eng	We're not abusing the system.
4529723	eng	We do everything we're asked.
4529724	eng	We can't afford that anymore.
4529725	eng	Tom wouldn't agree with this.
4529727	eng	Tom was arrested last Monday.
4529728	eng	Tom was arrested for assault.
4529729	eng	Tom should've told the truth.
4529730	eng	Tom said he appreciated that.
4529731	eng	Tom reluctantly agreed to go.
4529733	eng	Tom left Boston this morning.
4529736	eng	Tom is an amazing songwriter.
4529737	eng	Tom hasn't yet been arrested.
4529738	eng	Tom has offered no apologies.
4529739	eng	Tom doesn't need your advice.
4529740	eng	Tom didn't hesitate to agree.
4529741	eng	Tom can't afford that luxury.
4529743	eng	This is an amazing discovery.
4529744	eng	They're trained in first aid.
4529746	eng	They arrested Tom last night.
4529747	eng	There was no advance warning.
4529748	eng	The police didn't arrest Tom.
4529750	eng	The experts were amazed, too.
4529751	eng	The answer will surprise you.
4529752	eng	The answer to that's obvious.
4529753	eng	The answer seems too obvious.
4529754	eng	That's an abuse of authority.
4529756	eng	That'll be a big achievement.
4529757	eng	That isn't acceptable to Tom.
4529758	eng	That alone is an achievement.
4529761	eng	Mr. Jackson is our principal.
4529762	eng	Let me answer Tom's question.
4529763	eng	It's difficult to please Tom.
4529764	eng	It's been an amazing journey.
4529765	eng	It's amazing I'm still alive.
4529766	eng	It was an amazing experience.
4529767	eng	I thought you'd never arrive.
4529769	eng	I don't think that's allowed.
4529770	eng	I disagree with that comment.
4529771	eng	I completely approve of this.
4529772	eng	I appreciated Tom doing that.
4529773	eng	I agree with your assessment.
4529774	eng	I agree with that philosophy.
4529775	eng	How does one achieve success?
4529777	eng	How can this be accomplished?
4529779	eng	Did you anticipate that, too?
4529780	eng	"I don't know," admitted Tom.
4529782	eng	You are allowed one mistake.
4529783	eng	Who cares who appointed Tom?
4529784	eng	Who can afford this anymore?
4529785	eng	Who can afford these prices?
4529789	eng	We have to acknowledge that.
4529790	eng	We can't afford another war.
4529791	eng	We asked Tom some questions.
4529792	eng	Tom was looking for answers.
4529793	eng	Tom was arrested last month.
4529794	eng	Tom was arrested in October.
4529795	eng	Tom never talked about Mary.
4529796	eng	Tom might have been annoyed.
4529798	eng	Tom is now Mary's assistant.
4529799	eng	Tom is an amazing filmmaker.
4529801	eng	Tom had prepared his answer.
4529802	eng	Tom gave a different answer.
4529803	eng	Tom disagreed on that point.
4529804	eng	Tom didn't ask for anything.
4529805	eng	Tom didn't answer his phone.
4529807	eng	They're going to arrest you.
4529808	eng	The answer is pretty simple.
4529810	eng	That was just an assumption.
4529815	eng	It doesn't really affect me.
4529816	eng	I'm not asking for anything.
4529819	eng	I shouldn't have asked that.
4529821	eng	I disagree with the verdict.
4529823	eng	I definitely agree with Tom.
4529824	eng	I completely agree with Tom.
4529825	eng	I can't accept your apology.
4529826	eng	I appreciate you telling me.
4529827	eng	I apologize for the mistake.
4529828	eng	I agree with your sentiment.
4529829	eng	I agree with this statement.
4529830	eng	I agree with Tom's comments.
4529831	eng	How many firemen were there?
4529832	eng	How did you accomplish that?
4529833	eng	How did Tom accomplish that?
4529834	eng	Each student has an adviser.
4529835	eng	You like Boston, don't you?
4529836	eng	Won't Tom be busy tomorrow?
4529839	eng	What action should we take?
4529840	eng	We weren't allowed to talk.
4529841	eng	We simply can't allow that.
4529843	eng	Was that a fair assessment?
4529845	eng	Tom would never allow that.
4529847	eng	Tom was arrested on Monday.
4529848	eng	Tom was arrested last week.
4529849	eng	Tom was arrested in Boston.
4529851	eng	Tom thinks Mary is amazing.
4529852	eng	Tom seems a little annoyed.
4529853	eng	Tom said he wanted answers.
4529856	eng	Tom is unbeatable at chess.
4529857	eng	Tom didn't approve of that.
4529858	eng	Tom could be affected, too.
4529859	eng	Tom and Mary arrived first.
4529860	eng	Tom allowed this to happen.
4529862	eng	Those numbers don't add up.
4529863	eng	This is unacceptable to us.
4529864	eng	There are no wrong answers.
4529865	eng	The whole thing is amazing.
4529866	eng	The answer isn't yet clear.
4529867	eng	That's what I'm asking you.
4529868	eng	It really didn't affect us.
4529869	eng	It appears that Tom agrees.
4529870	eng	Is that what you're asking?
4529872	eng	I'm not apologizing to you.
4529873	eng	I wonder who appointed Tom.
4529874	eng	I won't accept these gifts.
4529875	eng	I thought Tom was adorable.
4529876	eng	I think it's quite amusing.
4529877	eng	I should admit my mistakes.
4529879	eng	I kind of anticipated that.
4529880	eng	I don't know those answers.
4529881	eng	I don't apologize for that.
4529882	eng	I couldn't afford a lawyer.
4529884	eng	I appreciate what Tom said.
4529885	eng	I agree with this proposal.
4529886	eng	I agree with Tom's opinion.
4529887	eng	How can we accomplish that?
4529890	eng	Does that affect the price?
4529891	eng	"It was boring," Tom added.
4529892	eng	You're allowed to do that.
4529893	eng	Would you agree with that?
4529894	eng	Who could argue with that?
4529896	eng	We can't abandon them now.
4529897	eng	Tom would agree with that.
4529898	eng	Tom will never admit that.
4529899	eng	Tom wanted to be accepted.
4529900	eng	Tom turned the engine off.
4529901	eng	Tom stood as I approached.
4529903	eng	Tom is feeling better now.
4529904	eng	Tom has agreed to testify.
4529906	eng	Tom appeared to be crying.
4529907	eng	Tom admits he wasn't sure.
4529909	eng	The whole town was amazed.
4529911	eng	The men were all arrested.
4529913	eng	That's not annoying to me.
4529914	eng	Stop acting like a victim.
4529916	eng	People always ask me that.
4529917	eng	No one disagreed with Tom.
4529918	eng	No arrests were ever made.
4529919	eng	No arrests have been made.
4529920	eng	It's been an amazing year.
4529922	eng	It was an amazing feeling.
4529924	eng	I totally agreed with Tom.
4529925	eng	I strongly agree with you.
4529926	eng	I love acting and singing.
4529927	eng	I guess I'm well adjusted.
4529928	eng	I guess I'm easily amused.
4529929	eng	I don't have your address.
4529930	eng	I don't disagree with Tom.
4529931	eng	I couldn't help but agree.
4529932	eng	I asked Tom what happened.
4529934	eng	I appreciate it very much.
4529935	eng	I agree with you entirely.
4529937	eng	Clearly, the answer is no.
4529939	eng	We needed to act quickly.
4529940	eng	We didn't get an apology.
4529941	eng	Was it acceptable to you?
4529942	eng	Tom, I disagree with you.
4529943	eng	Tom was arrested in 2013.
4529946	eng	Tom is an amazing person.
4529947	eng	Tom is an amazing father.
4529948	eng	Tom has my email address.
4529949	eng	Tom has agreed to attend.
4529950	eng	Tom had a brilliant idea.
4529951	eng	Tom didn't enjoy his job.
4529952	eng	Tom didn't argue with me.
4529953	eng	Tom did an amazing thing.
4529955	eng	This is an amazing offer.
4529958	eng	Please ask them to leave.
4529960	eng	Other than that, I agree.
4529961	eng	Nobody asked me to dance.
4529962	eng	No one has been arrested.
4529963	eng	Maybe Tom will adopt you.
4529964	eng	Maybe Tom has the answer.
4529965	eng	Mary is an amazing woman.
4529966	eng	Let's not argue about it.
4529967	eng	It simply doesn't add up.
4529968	eng	It didn't just affect me.
4529971	eng	I'm not an actor anymore.
4529972	eng	I wouldn't agree to that.
4529973	eng	I would tend to disagree.
4529974	eng	I won't argue that point.
4529977	eng	I disagree with you, Tom.
4529978	eng	I didn't agree with that.
4529979	eng	I assume Tom was kidding.
4529980	eng	I agree with you totally.
4529981	eng	How will this affect you?
4529982	eng	How does this affect you?
4529983	eng	How can this be achieved?
4529985	eng	Ask Tom how he's feeling.
4529986	eng	Anyway, I agree with Tom.
4529989	eng	You asked for my advice.
4529990	eng	Would Tom agree to this?
4529992	eng	Why did they arrest Tom?
4529993	eng	Who else agrees with me?
4529994	eng	What was Tom accused of?
4529996	eng	What else would you add?
4529997	eng	We were ready to attack.
4529998	eng	We knew that in advance.
4529999	eng	We hope to achieve that.
4530000	eng	We have to analyze that.
4530001	eng	Tom won't agree to that.
4530002	eng	Tom was asking for help.
4530003	eng	Tom was allowed to stay.
4530005	eng	Tom loves to annoy Mary.

4530015	eng	The short answer is yes.
4530017	eng	That could add to costs.
4530018	eng	Please ask Tom to leave.
4530019	eng	None of this affects us.
4530021	eng	It's too heavy to carry.
4530022	eng	It was an amazing place.
4530023	eng	It was an amazing movie.
4530024	eng	I'm not allowed to talk.
4530026	eng	I'm amazed I'm not dead.
4530027	eng	I totally agree on that.
4530028	eng	I have long admired Tom.
4530029	eng	I don't know the answer.
4530030	eng	I don't agree with them.
4530031	eng	I didn't argue with Tom.
4530032	eng	I can't afford the fees.
4530033	eng	I apologized to my boss.
4530035	eng	How will this affect us?
4530036	eng	How does this affect me?
4530037	eng	How did that affect you?
4530039	eng	Don't ask me that again.
4530040	eng	Ask me again in October.
4530041	eng	Arson is a criminal act.
4530042	eng	Are you annoyed by this?
4530043	eng	You just have to adapt.
4530044	eng	Who asked you for help?
4530045	eng	What we need is action.
4530046	eng	We have achieved a lot.
4530047	eng	We don't approve of it.
4530048	eng	Was Tom asked to leave?
4530050	eng	Tom will not be amused.
4530051	eng	Tom isn't a good actor.
4530052	eng	Tom had a quick answer.
4530053	eng	Tom did an amazing job.
4530054	eng	Tom and Mary were here.
4530055	eng	Tom amazes me at times.
4530058	eng	The short answer is no.
4530059	eng	That affected us a lot.
4530060	eng	Just give me an answer.
4530061	eng	It's too heavy to move.
4530062	eng	It's an abuse of power.
4530064	eng	It was an amazing trip.
4530065	eng	It was an amazing game.
4530066	eng	It just doesn't add up.
4530069	eng	I'm glad we agree, Tom.
4530070	eng	I still adore you guys.
4530071	eng	I fully agree with you.
4530073	eng	I asked Tom to explain.
4530074	eng	I asked Tom about that.
4530076	eng	I admire Tom very much.
4530077	eng	How often do you shave?
4530079	eng	Do you shave every day?
4530080	eng	Do you have the answer?

4530125	eng	It affects all of us.
4530126	eng	Is it an action movie?
4530127	eng	I was adopted by Tom.

4530141	eng	I do agree with Tom.
4530142	eng	I can't add that up.
4530143	eng	Ask Tom to be quiet.
4530145	eng	Tom tried to do it.
4530147	eng	Tom has to act now.
4530161	eng	Ask me if I care.
4530281	eng	Sorry for the dumb question.
4530705	eng	Add that to my bill.

4536164	eng	What is a chord progression?

4538259	eng	I saw her hide something.
4538260	eng	I saw Tom hide something.
4538539	eng	Then what does it mean?
4538640	eng	Is he feeling better today?

4538745	eng	Maybe it can be fixed.

4657438	eng	"That's awesome!" "You think so?"
4657446	eng	They were dancing a lot!
4657573	eng	I am determined to learn.
4657585	eng	We talked about time zones.
4657839	eng	His wife is from Seville.
4659247	eng	I don't speak Esperanto well.
4659466	eng	I make an honest living.
4659799	eng	This time I defeated you.
4659806	eng	This conclusively decided the matter.
4660230	eng	She was nice to everyone.
4660260	eng	I kind of like him.
4660279	eng	Tom had a bad accident.
4660284	eng	You're not going to win.
4660344	eng	Tom was a child actor.
4660408	eng	She called her a slut.
4660417	eng	Tom has a large mustache.
4660435	eng	Tom is such a loser.
4660453	eng	"We're getting married Friday." "What?"
4660512	eng	Marriage is a lifelong commitment.
4660540	eng	Her father entered the room.
4660559	eng	Tom ate some barbecued ribs.
4660576	eng	I read this in Cosmopolitan.
4660577	eng	I read this in Cosmo.
4660623	eng	The girls were quite impressed.
4661217	eng	Tom has only one testicle.
4661383	eng	Tom has an underarm odor.
4662976	eng	Tom's injuries aren't considered life-threatening.
4662977	eng	Tom's experience attracted considerable attention.
4663366	eng	There's definitely something bothering Tom.
4663372	eng	Maintaining friendships can be challenging.
4663392	eng	Approximately thirty young people attended.
4663402	eng	Unfortunately, there may be complications.
4663464	eng	Police are continuing their investigation.
4663550	eng	That's an extremely complicated question.
4663575	eng	Call 1-800-828-6322 for more information.
4663589	eng	Tom said investigations were continuing.
4663593	eng	Tom needs medical attention immediately.
4663604	eng	Tom doesn't understand what's happening.
4663698	eng	Tom successfully completed the program.
4663702	eng	Tom now requires around-the-clock care.
4663739	eng	Tom considers himself relatively lucky.
4663749	eng	This is something completely different.
4663755	eng	The contradiction is painfully obvious.
4663759	eng	Several proposals have been considered.
4663768	eng	I've never played music professionally.
4663787	eng	Flight attendants, prepare for landing.
4663788	eng	Everything has been thoroughly cleaned.
4663792	eng	Contracts have already been negotiated.
4663799	eng	Your statements contradict each other.
4663800	eng	Your French has improved considerably.
4663802	eng	You probably wouldn't understand this.
4663814	eng	Tom's injury isn't considered serious.
4663815	eng	Tom's handwriting is almost illegible.
4663822	eng	Tom still hasn't completely recovered.
4663882	eng	Tom Jackson wasn't reelected governor.
4663883	eng	Three homes were completely destroyed.
4663889	eng	Suddenly, the crowd stopped cheering.
4663890	eng	Schedules are difficult to coordinate.
4663916	eng	I consider that racial discrimination.
4663923	eng	Clearly, we have different priorities.
4663926	eng	Your outrage is completely justified.
4663927	eng	You're comparing apples with oranges.
4663932	eng	Who could've foreseen this happening?
4663955	eng	Tom hasn't complained about anything.
4663961	eng	Tom has apparently committed suicide.
4663968	eng	Tom eventually became Mary's husband.
4663993	eng	Tom didn't require medical attention.
4664009	eng	This should become standard practice.
4664012	eng	They've got everything under control.
4664015	eng	That would be terribly disappointing.
4664016	eng	That was a complete misunderstanding.
4664017	eng	Teachers are becoming more important.
4664018	eng	Something has caught Tom's attention.
4664021	eng	Potentially, that could happen again.
4664028	eng	Jury deliberations will begin Monday.
4664029	eng	It's difficult to eliminate cheating.
4664030	eng	It's becoming really, really popular.
4664034	eng	I'm considering buying a condominium.
4664062	eng	Construction should start in October.
4664086	eng	Tom will understand this eventually.
4664087	eng	Tom was captured almost immediately.
4664092	eng	Tom received the award posthumously.
4664116	eng	Tom eventually became an instructor.
4664133	eng	Tom didn't sound entirely convinced.
4664145	eng	Tom did something incredibly stupid.
4664146	eng	Tom couldn't be contacted yesterday.
4664147	eng	Tom avoided answering our questions.
4664152	eng	Those figures couldn't be confirmed.
4664154	eng	This contract is totally ridiculous.
4664158	eng	There's no difference between these.
4664159	eng	There really weren't any challenges.
4664163	eng	The investigation could take months.
4664164	eng	The garage was completely destroyed.
4664165	eng	That's the most immediate challenge.
4664166	eng	That'll be an interesting challenge.
4664168	eng	That concludes my opening statement.
4664169	eng	Read all the instructions carefully.
4664170	eng	Obviously, you've changed your mind.
4664171	eng	My grandchildren attend this school.
4664204	eng	How do they celebrate anniversaries?
4664209	eng	Doing that definitely couldn't hurt.
4664212	eng	Construction could begin in October.
4664219	eng	Your anger is completely justified.
4664220	eng	Your troubles are just beginning.
4664221	eng	You're not being very constructive.
4664222	eng	You're definitely smarter than Tom.
4664224	eng	You wouldn't recognize Tom anymore.
4664236	eng	We've finally stopped the bleeding.
4664238	eng	We're encouraging everyone to come.
4664239	eng	We're concerned about Tom's future.
4664242	eng	We became best friends immediately.
4664245	eng	Tom's French was surprisingly good.
4664256	eng	Tom never complains about anything.
4664267	eng	Tom hasn't been officially charged.
4664268	eng	Tom has poor hand-eye coordination.
4664269	eng	Tom has never celebrated Christmas.
4664294	eng	Tom didn't complain about anything.
4664300	eng	Tom always forgets Mary's birthday.
4664308	eng	The jury began deliberating Monday.
4664309	eng	The investigation could take weeks.
4664311	eng	The equations are very complicated.
4664312	eng	The construction could take months.
4664313	eng	The cause wasn't immediately known.
4664314	eng	The cause wasn't immediately clear.
4664316	eng	That's exactly what's bothering me.
4664317	eng	That's completely beside the point.
4664318	eng	That wouldn't be my recommendation.
4664320	eng	That attack killed thirteen people.
4664322	eng	Neither defendant was found guilty.
4664323	eng	It's really unbelievable, isn't it?
4664324	eng	It's definitely worth checking out.
4664325	eng	It's both challenging and exciting.
4664326	eng	It's an extremely worthwhile cause.
4664327	eng	It's a really complicated question.
4664333	eng	I'm especially concerned about Tom.
4664334	eng	I'm clearly missing something here.
4664353	eng	Friendships tend to be challenging.
4664362	eng	Anybody can contribute their ideas.
4664363	eng	Actually, that's not quite correct.
4664364	eng	You've made that abundantly clear.
4664365	eng	You weren't even paying attention.
4664374	eng	We're excited about the challenge.
4664378	eng	Unfortunately, help came too late.
4664379	eng	Tom's troubles are only beginning.
4664380	eng	Tom's intentions were quite clear.
4664399	eng	Tom recently converted to Judaism.
4664401	eng	Tom isn't our largest contributor.
4664409	eng	Tom is coordinating this activity.
4664422	eng	Tom doesn't usually eat breakfast.
4664424	eng	Tom doesn't sound very optimistic.
4664425	eng	Tom doesn't seem too enthusiastic.
4664444	eng	Tom didn't seem very enthusiastic.
4664445	eng	Tom didn't seem totally convinced.
4664451	eng	Tom couldn't be reached yesterday.
4664458	eng	Tom became a staunch conservative.
4664459	eng	Tom avoided answering my question.
4664466	eng	Things are changing quite rapidly.
4664467	eng	These are very competitive prices.
4664468	eng	There's little cause for optimism.
4664469	eng	There isn't anything to celebrate.
4664471	eng	The situation has become hopeless.
4664473	eng	The noise gradually became louder.
4664474	eng	The evidence is fairly conclusive.
4664475	eng	That would be truly revolutionary.
4664477	eng	Our situation has become critical.
4664478	eng	Nobody will convince me otherwise.
4664479	eng	No special celebration is planned.
4664482	eng	It's a very challenging racetrack.
4664486	eng	I'm clearly doing something wrong.
4664495	eng	I don't consider that appropriate.
4664496	eng	I don't consider myself religious.
4664500	eng	Higher gas prices cause inflation.
4664501	eng	French isn't a difficult language.
4664502	eng	French is an interesting language.
4664503	eng	Frankly, I'm not overly concerned.
4664504	eng	Everything was supposed to change.
4664505	eng	Everyone is concerned and worried.
4664507	eng	Everybody is concerned about that.
4664514	eng	Deliveries will continue as usual.
4664516	eng	Clearly, something has gone wrong.
4664519	eng	Absolutely nobody saw this coming.
4664521	eng	You just aren't paying attention.
4664522	eng	You couldn't handle the pressure.
4664523	eng	Would people complain about that?
4664525	eng	We've been cleared for departure.
4664529	eng	Try breathing through your mouth.
4664535	eng	Tom signed a three-year contract.
4664548	eng	Tom hasn't violated his contract.
4664553	eng	Tom hasn't been paying attention.
4664565	eng	Tom doesn't sound very confident.
4664567	eng	Tom doesn't really understand me.
4664569	eng	Tom doesn't owe anybody anything.
4664580	eng	Tom didn't sound very optimistic.
4664587	eng	Tom didn't complete his homework.
4664589	eng	Tom desperately needs a vacation.
4664600	eng	Tom believes Mary killed herself.
4664601	eng	Tom became Mary's closest friend.
4664602	eng	Tom barely touched his breakfast.
4664606	eng	This could've happened to anyone.
4664607	eng	Things couldn't have gone better.
4664609	eng	The place is completely deserted.
4664610	eng	The fire caused extensive damage.
4664611	eng	The evaluation could take months.
4664612	eng	The department's rules are clear.
4664613	eng	The cause hasn't been pinpointed.
4664614	eng	The audience burst into applause.
4664615	eng	That's what's causing your hives.
4664616	eng	That would be really interesting.
4664618	eng	That sounds a little complicated.
4664621	eng	That concern has been eliminated.
4664622	eng	Someone could get seriously hurt.
4664623	eng	Prejudice will continue to exist.
4664624	eng	Perhaps the report was incorrect.
4664626	eng	Nothing would've made me happier.
4664627	eng	Nobody has been formally charged.
4664628	eng	Nobody can convince me otherwise.
4664629	eng	Making changes will be difficult.
4664630	eng	It's difficult to understand you.
4664631	eng	It's a very cheerful celebration.
4664640	eng	I'm looking forward to competing.
4664643	eng	I'm excited about this challenge.
4664653	eng	I don't expect any complications.
4664659	eng	How would that inconvenience you?
4664660	eng	Here's where it gets complicated.
4664661	eng	Everyone should be extra careful.
4664666	eng	Does anybody really care anymore?
4664671	eng	Could this possibly happen again?
4664675	eng	Bring your own fishing equipment.
4664676	eng	Apparently, not much has changed.
4664677	eng	Any suggestions would be helpful.
4664679	eng	You shouldn't call people liars.
4664686	eng	Why would that inconvenience me?
4664687	eng	Who could possibly believe this?
4664689	eng	What difference would that make?
4664690	eng	What are they complaining about?
4664691	eng	What are the biggest challenges?
4664693	eng	We're committed to doing better.
4664696	eng	We could've been great together.
4664699	eng	Tom's help isn't needed anymore.
4664704	eng	Tom won't believe what happened.
4664738	eng	Tom has been very understanding.
4664741	eng	Tom has always been competitive.
4664742	eng	Tom has accepted our invitation.
4664749	eng	Tom doesn't seem very surprised.
4664750	eng	Tom doesn't seem very satisfied.
4664751	eng	Tom doesn't seem very impressed.
4664752	eng	Tom doesn't seem very concerned.
4664764	eng	Tom doesn't get enough exercise.
4664765	eng	Tom doesn't complain about much.
4664768	eng	Tom didn't sound very surprised.
4664769	eng	Tom didn't sound very confident.
4664778	eng	Tom deserved everything he got.
4664781	eng	Tom could've hurt himself today.
4664782	eng	Tom could be Mary's replacement.
4664783	eng	Tom committed suicide last year.
4664784	eng	Tom committed suicide in prison.
4664788	eng	Tom bought some patio furniture.
4664791	eng	This isn't all that complicated.
4664792	eng	Things couldn't be going better.
4664793	eng	They only care about themselves.
4664794	eng	They brought this on themselves.
4664795	eng	There are some obvious concerns.
4664796	eng	There are also privacy concerns.
4664798	eng	The road was under construction.
4664801	eng	The funding could be inadequate.
4664802	eng	The captain's orders were clear.
4664803	eng	The audience burst out laughing.
4664804	eng	That's what brought us together.
4664806	eng	That's probably about to change.
4664810	eng	That should get Tom's attention.
4664813	eng	Some people don't own computers.
4664814	eng	Perhaps there are other reasons.
4664815	eng	People around here have changed.
4664816	eng	Overpopulation is a big concern.
4664817	eng	Our products sell well overseas.
4664818	eng	Our pricing is very competitive.
4664819	eng	Nothing more could've been done.
4664821	eng	Nobody cares about our problems.
4664822	eng	Nobody cares about my situation.
4664824	eng	Naturally, I was very concerned.
4664831	eng	It's something we might attempt.
4664832	eng	It's naive to believe otherwise.
4664833	eng	It's extremely concerning to us.
4664834	eng	It's bound to happen eventually.
4664835	eng	It's a major tourist attraction.
4664836	eng	It caught everybody by surprise.
4664839	eng	I'm watching the market closely.
4664841	eng	I'm deeply concerned about this.
4664842	eng	I'm concerned about health care.
4664844	eng	I'll continue being the manager.
4664850	eng	I wasn't complaining about that.
4664858	eng	I sincerely, truly believe that.
4664860	eng	I personally don't care anymore.
4664866	eng	I don't think anything's broken.
4664869	eng	I don't consider that expensive.
4664870	eng	I couldn't help overhearing you.
4664871	eng	I couldn't be more disappointed.
4664872	eng	I could hear everybody cheering.
4664873	eng	I can't think clearly sometimes.
4664877	eng	French isn't difficult to learn.
4664882	eng	Don't leave the fire unattended.
4664885	eng	Does the government really care?
4664886	eng	Does anyone really care anymore?
4664894	eng	An injustice has been corrected.
4664895	eng	You spelled the word correctly.
4664896	eng	You shouldn't have backed down.
4664903	eng	Yes, of course, you're correct.
4664907	eng	Which wine would you recommend?
4664908	eng	What would be the consequences?
4664910	eng	What connection could there be?
4664911	eng	What caused the budget deficit?
4664912	eng	We're not concerned about that.
4664913	eng	We're deeply concerned by that.
4664916	eng	We couldn't help being friends.
4664920	eng	Tom's flight has been canceled.
4664921	eng	Tom's books have sold millions.
4664922	eng	Tom wouldn't go into specifics.
4664925	eng	Tom won't return until evening.
4664934	eng	Tom should've said "thank you."
4664940	eng	Tom plans to continue teaching.
4664942	eng	Tom now faces criminal charges.
4664946	eng	Tom isn't welcome here anymore.
4664948	eng	Tom is interested in computers.
4664951	eng	Tom is facing criminal charges.
4664953	eng	Tom is concerned about funding.
4664954	eng	Tom is being very unreasonable.
4664958	eng	Tom invited everyone to attend.
4664966	eng	Tom has authored several books.
4664972	eng	Tom finished college last year.
4664973	eng	Tom eventually became a doctor.
4664976	eng	Tom doesn't seem too surprised.
4664978	eng	Tom doesn't seem too convinced.
4664981	eng	Tom doesn't need my permission.
4664990	eng	Tom doesn't have a temperature.
4664997	eng	Tom didn't seem very surprised.

4665001	eng	Tom didn't need any convincing.
4665011	eng	Tom didn't attend the ceremony.
4665012	eng	Tom didn't attend that meeting.
4665015	eng	Tom couldn't finish his dinner.
4665024	eng	Ticket sales will begin Monday.
4665026	eng	This experience has changed me.
4665028	eng	Things have changed since then.
4665029	eng	Things couldn't get any better.
4665030	eng	Things change very slowly here.
4665032	eng	There was nothing to celebrate.
4665035	eng	The trial will continue Monday.
4665036	eng	The treasure could be anywhere.
4665037	eng	The situation became very dire.
4665039	eng	The reason soon became obvious.
4665040	eng	The problem continues to exist.
4665042	eng	The kids suddenly become quiet.
4665043	eng	The fog made driving difficult.
4665044	eng	The contract expires next year.
4665045	eng	The contract expired on Monday.
4665047	eng	That's what caused our problem.
4665048	eng	That's going to cause problems.
4665049	eng	That's another concern of mine.
4665050	eng	That would probably make sense.
4665051	eng	That would never happen, right?
4665052	eng	That would be very unfortunate.
4665053	eng	That would be so inappropriate.
4665055	eng	That could take several months.
4665057	eng	Some customs will never change.
4665058	eng	Please read my reply carefully.
4665059	eng	Parents were invited to attend.
4665060	eng	Our wedding plans have changed.
4665061	eng	Nothing's ever going to change.
4665062	eng	Nothing has been confirmed yet.
4665063	eng	My life has changed completely.
4665064	eng	My ankles often become swollen.
4665066	eng	Life has become very difficult.
4665068	eng	It's such a unique combination.
4665072	eng	Is there a contradiction there?
4665075	eng	I've been coaching three years.
4665076	eng	I'm very, very, very concerned.
4665078	eng	I'm sad for everyone concerned.
4665081	eng	I'm a retired flight attendant.
4665090	eng	I couldn't survive without Tom.
4665094	eng	I certainly don't condone that.
4665099	eng	Everyone is concerned about it.
4665100	eng	Everyone has a signed contract.
4665101	eng	Everybody seems to be confused.
4665102	eng	Everybody is invited to attend.
4665108	eng	Don't forget your bathing suit.
4665111	eng	Does anyone really believe Tom?
4665113	eng	Do you think that's attainable?
4665116	eng	Could this have been prevented?
4665119	eng	Can people change their habits?
4665120	eng	Boxing isn't like other sports.
4665123	eng	A background check is required.
4665128	eng	You certainly deserve a break.
4665129	eng	Will people actually buy this?
4665131	eng	Why would anyone be surprised?
4665135	eng	Why couldn't someone help Tom?
4665137	eng	Who could complain about that?
4665139	eng	Which one would you recommend?
4665140	eng	What's been keeping you awake?
4665141	eng	What else are you considering?
4665142	eng	What could be more worthwhile?
4665144	eng	What changes should we expect?
4665146	eng	We're still a little confused.
4665147	eng	We're concerned about it, too.
4665148	eng	We're aware of the challenges.
4665149	eng	We'll continue to support Tom.
4665150	eng	We'll continue to be vigilant.
4665151	eng	We wish you continued success.
4665152	eng	We wish Tom continued success.
4665153	eng	We should be paying attention.
4665155	eng	We have to remain competitive.
4665156	eng	Tomorrow we will attack again.
4665158	eng	Tom's family owns this bakery.
4665160	eng	Tom's birthday is coming soon.
4665161	eng	Tom's advice has been helpful.
4665162	eng	Tom would've loved this movie.
4665174	eng	Tom was cleared of wrongdoing.
4665178	eng	Tom signed the contract first.
4665179	eng	Tom should make a reservation.
4665183	eng	Tom pays attention to details.
4665184	eng	Tom often breaks his promises.
4665200	eng	Tom is doing everything wrong.
4665202	eng	Tom is considering doing that.
4665205	eng	Tom hurt himself this morning.
4665208	eng	Tom has some serious problems.
4665216	eng	Tom has cause for celebration.
4665225	eng	Tom faces many new challenges.
4665228	eng	Tom doesn't talk much anymore.
4665229	eng	Tom doesn't seem very pleased.
4665234	eng	Tom doesn't really trust Mary.
4665238	eng	Tom doesn't keep his promises.
4665239	eng	Tom doesn't have any freckles.
4665241	eng	Tom didn't seem too surprised.
4665243	eng	Tom didn't say anything wrong.
4665244	eng	Tom didn't look too surprised.
4665250	eng	Tom didn't do enough research.
4665254	eng	Tom couldn't solve the puzzle.
4665255	eng	Tom couldn't keep his balance.
4665258	eng	Tom committed suicide in 2013.
4665262	eng	Tom became the band's manager.
4665267	eng	Tom almost became a paramedic.
4665269	eng	They're trying to control you.
4665270	eng	They came to an understanding.
4665271	eng	There should be a celebration.
4665272	eng	There really is no comparison.
4665273	eng	The wedding's been called off.
4665274	eng	The process has already begun.
4665276	eng	The economy continues to grow.
4665277	eng	The details are still unclear.
4665278	eng	The company continued to grow.
4665279	eng	The budget is extremely small.
4665280	eng	That's not a valid comparison.
4665281	eng	That's not a good combination.
4665282	eng	That would violate our policy.
4665283	eng	That would defeat the purpose.
4665284	eng	That would be somewhat ironic.
4665286	eng	That story can't be confirmed.
4665289	eng	Thanks for catching the error.
4665290	eng	Some things just never change.
4665291	eng	Several things need to change.
4665292	eng	Safety is the primary concern.
4665293	eng	Parents are invited to attend.
4665295	eng	My parents don't speak French.
4665296	eng	Most people really don't care.
4665297	eng	More than 300 people attended.
4665298	eng	More challenges may lie ahead.
4665300	eng	Maybe we should eat something.
4665301	eng	Life became difficult for Tom.
4665303	eng	Kids don't read books anymore.
4665305	eng	It's time to begin downsizing.
4665306	eng	It's quite an unusual concept.
4665307	eng	It's not all that complicated.
4665310	eng	It's a very historic building.
4665311	eng	It's a really tough challenge.
4665315	eng	Is your French getting better?
4665316	eng	Is there a direct correlation?
4665317	eng	I've never tried Mexican food.
4665318	eng	I'm very concerned about this.
4665319	eng	I'm a very competitive person.
4665323	eng	I wouldn't celebrate just yet.
4665326	eng	I wasn't concerned about that.
4665334	eng	I hear you're studying French.
4665336	eng	I enjoy collecting rare coins.
4665338	eng	I don't have health insurance.
4665339	eng	I don't believe it's possible.
4665342	eng	I couldn't help with anything.
4665347	eng	How did your friendship begin?
4665348	eng	Have you met Tom's girlfriend?
4665349	eng	Have you hugged anyone lately?
4665350	eng	Everything comes down to cost.
4665351	eng	Everyone knew what was coming.
4665352	eng	Everyone except Tom ate pizza.
4665353	eng	Everybody else is coming, too.
4665356	eng	Don't let anyone sit here.
4665358	eng	Do you seriously believe that?
4665361	eng	Could you please do something?
4665363	eng	Both statements could be true.
4665366	eng	A smile doesn't cost anything.
4665369	eng	You're welcome to come along.
4665373	eng	You couldn't be more correct.
4665374	eng	Would you have believed that?
4665375	eng	Would tonight be soon enough?
4665376	eng	Would that make a difference?
4665377	eng	Would someone please help me?
4665381	eng	Who are we competing against?
4665382	eng	Where else could that happen?
4665385	eng	What's this called in French?
4665386	eng	What would be the difference?
4665387	eng	What caused the power outage?
4665388	eng	What brings you here tonight?
4665389	eng	We're facing a budget crisis.
4665392	eng	We need a coordinated effort.
4665393	eng	We look forward to competing.
4665394	eng	We have a special connection.
4665395	eng	We had absolutely no control.
4665396	eng	We can't ignore this anymore.
4665397	eng	We can't control the weather.
4665400	eng	Tom's closest friend is Mary.
4665402	eng	Tom worked closely with Mary.
4665406	eng	Tom was an outstanding coach.
4665408	eng	Tom said he wasn't concerned.
4665409	eng	Tom said he forgot something.
4665410	eng	Tom rarely wears dark colors.
4665411	eng	Tom only cared about himself.
4665418	eng	Tom lost his reading glasses.
4665419	eng	Tom likes Boston, doesn't he?
4665425	eng	Tom is exaggerating, I think.
4665430	eng	Tom is always criticizing me.
4665431	eng	Tom is abusing his authority.
4665441	eng	Tom is Mary's closest friend.
4665443	eng	Tom has done something wrong.
4665453	eng	Tom explained that very well.
4665454	eng	Tom doesn't think he'll lose.
4665456	eng	Tom doesn't really love Mary.
4665468	eng	Tom discussed that with Mary.
4665469	eng	Tom didn't understand at all.
4665470	eng	Tom didn't seem very pleased.
4665474	eng	Tom didn't have to apologize.
4665476	eng	Tom couldn't handle the pain.
4665477	eng	Tom couldn't handle that job.
4665478	eng	Tom couldn't be here tonight.
4665480	eng	Tom could've gone by himself.
4665481	eng	Tom caught on pretty quickly.
4665484	eng	Tom burst into the apartment.
4665485	eng	Tom and John aren't brothers.
4665487	eng	Tom always likes a challenge.
4665491	eng	This time could be different.
4665492	eng	This situation has to change.
4665494	eng	This could hurt our business.
4665495	eng	This always makes me chuckle.
4665496	eng	Things won't change too much.
4665497	eng	The referee blew his whistle.
4665498	eng	The policies are quite clear.
4665499	eng	The hotel is completely full.
4665500	eng	The changes won't be radical.
4665501	eng	The campfire has burned down.
4665502	eng	The area looked pretty clean.
4665503	eng	The Jacksons moved to Boston.
4665504	eng	That's my conclusion as well.
4665505	eng	That's how we became friends.
4665506	eng	That would violate our rules.
4665507	eng	That would explain the delay.
4665508	eng	That would be awesome, right?
4665509	eng	That would be almost perfect.
4665510	eng	That was completely my fault.
4665512	eng	Thanks for returning my call.
4665513	eng	Take control of your destiny.
4665514	eng	Somebody else could get hurt.
4665515	eng	Safety is always our concern.
4665517	eng	Nobody ever calls me anymore.
4665518	eng	Nobody can compete with that.
4665519	eng	No machine could replace you.
4665520	eng	Maybe I'll call you sometime.
4665523	eng	Let's get this party rolling.
4665524	eng	It's unclear what went wrong.
4665526	eng	It's really tough to compare.
4665528	eng	It's not a difficult concept.
4665529	eng	It's a public safety concern.
4665530	eng	It's a pretty simple concept.
4665531	eng	It couldn't have been better.
4665533	eng	It could be too overwhelming.
4665535	eng	Is Tom even paying attention?
4665536	eng	I've always hated that color.
4665537	eng	I'm starting to learn French.
4665538	eng	I'm starting to believe that.
4665542	eng	I'll think it over carefully.
4665545	eng	I skipped French class today.
4665546	eng	I shouldn't have backed down.
4665548	eng	I really, truly believe that.
4665549	eng	I really couldn't believe it.
4665551	eng	I personally could care less.
4665552	eng	I love being called Grandpa.
4665554	eng	I hate cleaning the bathroom.
4665555	eng	I enjoyed being here tonight.
4665558	eng	I couldn't hear myself think.
4665559	eng	I couldn't have been happier.
4665560	eng	I could sense Tom's presence.
4665561	eng	I could have terminal cancer.
4665562	eng	I can't change what happened.
4665563	eng	I believe this is inaccurate.
4665564	eng	I almost couldn't believe it.
4665565	eng	How were the bombs detonated?
4665568	eng	French is my native language.
4665569	eng	Everybody got sent back home.
4665574	eng	Does the color really matter?
4665575	eng	Do you speak French fluently?
4665577	eng	Could you see that happening?
4665578	eng	Could Tom have been murdered?
4665579	eng	A compromise may be required.
4665580	eng	Your parents would be proud.
4665581	eng	You'd better not get caught.
4665582	eng	You should leave right away.
4665584	eng	Would you please just leave?
4665585	eng	Would you like more details?
4665587	eng	Why would that surprise you?
4665588	eng	Why won't anyone believe me?
4665589	eng	Why don't people believe me?
4665590	eng	Why do you suspect sabotage?
4665595	eng	What would your solution be?
4665596	eng	What made you change course?
4665597	eng	What could be more romantic?
4665598	eng	What brought the price down?
4665600	eng	Well, that could be helpful.
4665601	eng	We're trying to change that.
4665602	eng	We're going to make changes.
4665603	eng	We won't be buying anything.
4665604	eng	We should be very concerned.
4665605	eng	We need to change direction.
4665607	eng	We didn't complain about it.
4665608	eng	We couldn't cross the river.
4665610	eng	We believe Tom was murdered.
4665611	eng	Was it really coming closer?
4665612	eng	Tom's hair was slicked back.
4665613	eng	Tom's flight leaves at 2:30.
4665621	eng	Tom will think of something.
4665622	eng	Tom will tell me everything.
4665631	eng	Tom simply couldn't keep up.
4665635	eng	Tom seems attracted to Mary.
4665636	eng	Tom says he's not concerned.
4665637	eng	Tom really needs a vacation.
4665638	eng	Tom is working late tonight.
4665639	eng	Tom is twenty minutes early.
4665647	eng	Tom is an amazing guitarist.
4665654	eng	Tom has done enough already.
4665657	eng	Tom has certainly been busy.
4665662	eng	Tom has already done enough.
4665667	eng	Tom enjoys a good challenge.
4665672	eng	Tom doesn't need me anymore.
4665675	eng	Tom doesn't know the system.
4665681	eng	Tom didn't miss the meeting.
4665688	eng	Tom didn't complain, did he?
4665689	eng	Tom didn't attend the forum.
4665690	eng	Tom didn't attend the event.
4665692	eng	Tom demanded his money back.
4665693	eng	Tom couldn't talk very well.
4665694	eng	Tom couldn't have done more.
4665695	eng	Tom couldn't bear the truth.
4665697	eng	Tom could've asked me first.
4665699	eng	Tom could be doing anything.
4665700	eng	Tom continued to get better.
4665702	eng	Tom claims he was misquoted.
4665703	eng	Tom can't stay here anymore.
4665704	eng	Tom can't live here anymore.
4665705	eng	Tom can't handle this alone.
4665706	eng	Tom can't go anywhere today.
4665709	eng	Tom called for an interview.
4665710	eng	Tom brought this on himself.
4665711	eng	Tom blamed everything on me.
4665713	eng	This isn't likely to change.
4665714	eng	This is really bothering me.
4665715	eng	This is completely my fault.
4665716	eng	This is a complicated issue.
4665718	eng	They're not going to change.
4665722	eng	There's blood on your hands.
4665723	eng	There's blood on this knife.
4665724	eng	There will be no compromise.
4665725	eng	There has been a compromise.
4665726	eng	The trail is clearly marked.
4665727	eng	The orchestra began to play.
4665728	eng	The noise didn't bother Tom.
4665729	eng	The movie has already begun.
4665731	eng	The biggest concern is cost.
4665732	eng	The audience began to laugh.
4665733	eng	That's none of your concern.
4665736	eng	That's been made very clear.
4665737	eng	That's basically why I came.
4665738	eng	That's always a big concern.
4665739	eng	That's all they cared about.
4665740	eng	That'll bring the cost down.
4665741	eng	That would be very exciting.
4665744	eng	That umbrella belongs to me.
4665745	eng	That couldn't be more wrong.
4665746	eng	That budget isn't yet final.
4665749	eng	So many things have changed.
4665750	eng	Security is still a concern.
4665751	eng	Sales will continue to grow.
4665752	eng	People are afraid of change.
4665753	eng	Now you're bringing me down.
4665754	eng	Nothing seems to bother Tom.
4665756	eng	My grandkids live in Boston.
4665757	eng	Maybe your luck is changing.
4665758	eng	Mary is an attractive woman.
4665760	eng	Make sure you choose wisely.
4665761	eng	Listen to me very carefully.
4665762	eng	Let's think outside the box.
4665763	eng	Let's go visit the Jacksons.
4665764	eng	Let's bring our troops home.
4665766	eng	It's already out of control.
4665767	eng	It must've been an accident.
4665768	eng	It couldn't have been worse.
4665769	eng	Is your blood pressure high?
4665771	eng	Is Tom feeling better today?
4665773	eng	I'm ready for the challenge.
4665774	eng	I'm not concerned right now.
4665777	eng	I'm going to miss competing.
4665778	eng	I'll still call Boston home.
4665783	eng	I suggest you pay attention.
4665784	eng	I sometimes dream about Tom.
4665786	eng	I remember that day clearly.
4665790	eng	I just couldn't stop myself.
4665791	eng	I doubt that'll ever change.
4665792	eng	I don't have any complaints.
4665793	eng	I don't care about politics.
4665794	eng	I don't believe you anymore.
4665796	eng	I couldn't even feed myself.
4665797	eng	I couldn't do anything else.
4665798	eng	I could've done that better.
4665801	eng	I complained to the manager.
4665802	eng	I can't believe it happened.
4665804	eng	I almost became a carpenter.
4665805	eng	How will you be celebrating?
4665806	eng	How could anyone think that?
4665807	eng	Here is a brief explanation.
4665808	eng	Here is a brief description.
4665810	eng	Everyone is welcome to come.
4665812	eng	Don't pay attention to them.
4665818	eng	Do you share those concerns?
4665819	eng	Do you believe these rumors?
4665820	eng	Do you believe in astrology?
4665822	eng	Could there be a connection?
4665823	eng	Could Tom have changed this?
4665824	eng	Come on, we're running late.
4665825	eng	Come on, we're almost there.
4665828	eng	Call me if anything changes.
4665829	eng	Bring your own picnic lunch.
4665830	eng	Are we doing this correctly?
4665831	eng	Your mother would be proud.
4665833	eng	Would this afternoon be OK?
4665834	eng	Why wouldn't Tom want that?
4665836	eng	Why are people so careless?
4665837	eng	Who would oppose this plan?
4665840	eng	Who couldn't be happy here?
4665841	eng	Who cares what it's called?
4665842	eng	Who cares about that stuff?
4665843	eng	Where will that take place?
4665846	eng	When was this bridge built?
4665847	eng	What's your new book about?
4665849	eng	What would your mother say?
4665850	eng	What else could you expect?
4665851	eng	What crime did they commit?
4665852	eng	What caused that to happen?
4665853	eng	What brought you to Boston?
4665854	eng	What are they checking for?
4665855	eng	We're beginning to see why.
4665856	eng	We were concerned at first.
4665857	eng	We don't have any concerns.
4665858	eng	We control our own destiny.
4665859	eng	We caught them by surprise.
4665860	eng	We can't continue this way.
4665861	eng	We can't blame anyone else.
4665863	eng	We all couldn't believe it.
4665864	eng	Try to improve your French.
4665865	eng	Tonight could be the night.
4665866	eng	Tom's voice began to crack.
4665868	eng	Tom's hands began to shake.
4665872	eng	Tom wouldn't let Mary quit.
4665874	eng	Tom will never change that.
4665878	eng	Tom wasn't at school today.
4665880	eng	Tom was listening to music.
4665881	eng	Tom was covered in bruises.
4665882	eng	Tom was clearly the winner.
4665883	eng	Tom was calm and collected.
4665884	eng	Tom wants to compete again.
4665887	eng	Tom should get back inside.
4665889	eng	Tom should be more careful.
4665890	eng	Tom said that would change.
4665894	eng	Tom probably won't like me.
4665895	eng	Tom knows where he belongs.
4665896	eng	Tom keeps bringing that up.
4665898	eng	Tom is way too pessimistic.
4665903	eng	Tom is far too pessimistic.
4665904	eng	Tom is dressed very nicely.
4665905	eng	Tom is doing nothing wrong.
4665907	eng	Tom is carrying a backpack.
4665908	eng	Tom is always welcome here.
4665910	eng	Tom is almost always right.
4665914	eng	Tom is a little overweight.
4665915	eng	Tom is a fierce competitor.
4665916	eng	Tom heard a familiar voice.
4665917	eng	Tom hasn't eaten lunch yet.
4665918	eng	Tom hasn't called back yet.
4665919	eng	Tom hasn't broken any laws.
4665924	eng	Tom has been very tolerant.
4665925	eng	Tom has been quite helpful.
4665928	eng	Tom has already thanked me.
4665929	eng	Tom has accepted our offer.
4665930	eng	Tom has a well-trained dog.
4665933	eng	Tom has a good imagination.
4665937	eng	Tom got married, didn't he?
4665938	eng	Tom forgot to mention that.
4665939	eng	Tom drinks too much coffee.
4665940	eng	Tom doesn't win very often.

4665971	eng	Tom couldn't have done that.
4665973	eng	Tom convinced Mary to help.
4665974	eng	Tom continued to date Mary.
4665978	eng	Tom believes Mary is wrong.
4665979	eng	Tom appears to be sleeping.
4665981	eng	Tom already knows too much.
4665982	eng	This will change your life.
4665983	eng	This needs to be corrected.
4665984	eng	This is the last challenge.
4665985	eng	This is all very confusing.
4665986	eng	This is a little confusing.
4665987	eng	This could get quite messy.
4665989	eng	Things could be much worse.
4665990	eng	They invited me back again.
4665991	eng	They have corrected it now.
4665993	eng	There can be no compromise.
4665994	eng	The window is still broken.
4665995	eng	The policy is pretty clear.
4665996	eng	The exact cause is unknown.
4665997	eng	The crowd began to applaud.
4665998	eng	The boss could be watching.
4665999	eng	That's why we need changes.
4666000	eng	That's what Tom would want.
4666001	eng	That's out of your control.
4666003	eng	That's all they care about.
4666004	eng	That's a very real concern.
4666005	eng	That's a huge cost savings.
4666006	eng	That'll happen to you, too.
4666007	eng	That would really be great.
4666008	eng	That would fix the problem.
4666009	eng	That would be really funny.
4666010	eng	That was a big celebration.
4666011	eng	That needs to be corrected.
4666012	eng	That just wouldn't be fair.
4666015	eng	Radiation is a big concern.
4666020	eng	Maybe that will change now.
4666021	eng	Mary is an attractive girl.
4666022	eng	It's unclear when Tom died.
4666023	eng	It's hard to change people.
4666024	eng	It's going to be corrected.
4666026	eng	It cost 30 million dollars.
4666027	eng	I've since changed my mind.
4666028	eng	I'm glad you contacted Tom.
4666030	eng	I'll buy an iPhone instead.
4666034	eng	I tried everything I could.
4666036	eng	I never would've done that.
4666037	eng	I miss my mother's cooking.
4666039	eng	I just couldn't believe it.
4666040	eng	I haven't attempted it yet.
4666041	eng	I don't think that's legal.
4666042	eng	I don't consider this safe.
4666044	eng	I didn't really believe it.
4666045	eng	I couldn't get warm enough.
4666046	eng	I couldn't catch my breath.
4666047	eng	I couldn't be more pleased.
4666048	eng	I couldn't be more excited.
4666049	eng	I bought a bicycle instead.
4666051	eng	How could things get worse?
4666052	eng	How could that ever happen?
4666053	eng	How could anyone forget it?
4666054	eng	Housing is the big concern.

4666056	eng	Don't pay attention to Tom.
4666060	eng	Don't let Tom say anything.
4666061	eng	Don't let Tom hurt himself.
4666065	eng	Change can and will happen.
4666066	eng	Can you explain it briefly?
4666067	eng	Bring your own chess board.
4666068	eng	Back then it was different.
4666070	eng	Are you ready to celebrate?
4666071	eng	Are you a Canadian citizen?
4666072	eng	A crime has been committed.
4666073	eng	You spelled my name wrong.
4666076	eng	You have to pay attention.
4666077	eng	Would you say that's true?
4666078	eng	Would you bet against Tom?
4666079	eng	Would that have been hard?
4666080	eng	Why would Tom be offended?
4666081	eng	Who would risk doing that?
4666082	eng	Where will you be tonight?
4666083	eng	What would the others say?
4666084	eng	What song was Tom singing?
4666085	eng	What crime did Tom commit?
4666086	eng	We're up to the challenge.

4666115	eng	Tom is from Boston, right?
4666116	eng	Tom is expecting too much.
4666117	eng	Tom is doing really great.
4666119	eng	Tom is always saying that.
4666120	eng	Tom is almost never wrong.

4666175	eng	Tom could've come with me.
4666176	eng	Tom could've been the one.
4666178	eng	Tom could change his mind.
4666180	eng	Tom can't do that anymore.
4666181	eng	Tom can't dance very well.
4666186	eng	Tom came into the kitchen.
4666189	eng	This may change next year.
4666190	eng	This is only half correct.
4666192	eng	These laws need to change.
4666193	eng	There's a lot to consider.
4666194	eng	The warning came too late.
4666195	eng	The gates are now closing.
4666196	eng	The front door burst open.
4666197	eng	The fire is still burning.
4666198	eng	The elevator is coming up.
4666199	eng	The bus burst into flames.
4666200	eng	The back door's wide open.
4666201	eng	That's what we usually do.
4666202	eng	That's what Tom would say.
4666203	eng	That's the change we need.
4666204	eng	That's all I can remember.
4666206	eng	That would be really cool.
4666207	eng	That would be pretty cool.
4666208	eng	That would be my response.
4666209	eng	That doesn't belong to me.
4666210	eng	Someone broke into my car.
4666211	eng	People came from all over.
4666215	eng	My job is teaching French.
4666218	eng	Life has been very hard.
4666219	eng	Let's continue to do this.
4666221	eng	Let me check the calendar.
4666222	eng	Jackson is my family name.
4666223	eng	It's wonderful to be back.
4666224	eng	It's unclear how Tom died.
4666225	eng	It's time we changed that.
4666226	eng	It's just a little bruise.
4666227	eng	It's easy to get confused.
4666228	eng	It really isn't a concern.
4666230	eng	Is Tom partially to blame?
4666231	eng	I've never heard Tom sing.
4666232	eng	I'm not going to complain.
4666233	eng	I'm going to correct this.
4666234	eng	I'm concerned for my kids.
4666235	eng	I'll take the whole blame.
4666238	eng	I was concerned about Tom.
4666239	eng	I urgently need your help.
4666240	eng	I thought that would work.
4666241	eng	I think this isn't enough.
4666244	eng	I still didn't believe it.
4666245	eng	I really love coming here.
4666246	eng	I really don't believe so.
4666248	eng	I love competing with Tom.
4666249	eng	I just don't believe that.
4666250	eng	I heard it hasn't changed.
4666251	eng	I have nothing to confess.
4666252	eng	I expect that to continue.
4666256	eng	I don't even care anymore.
4666258	eng	I do believe you're wrong.
4666260	eng	I didn't consult with Tom.
4666261	eng	I couldn't help but watch.
4666264	eng	I believe in my teammates.
4666265	eng	I barely slept last night.
4666267	eng	How could anyone hate Tom?
4666268	eng	Even Tom couldn't do that.
4666269	eng	Don't tell Tom the answer.
4666271	eng	Don't let Tom fall asleep.
4666273	eng	Don't drink the tap water.
4666274	eng	Don't be afraid of change.
4666276	eng	Could it have been murder?
4666277	eng	Could Tom have been saved?
4666278	eng	Costs are rising too fast.
4666281	eng	Both parties are to blame.
4666283	eng	Are you really in control?
4666284	eng	You've got to avoid that.
4666286	eng	You need to convince Tom.
4666287	eng	You have to make changes.
4666290	eng	Would you please help us?
4666291	eng	Would anyone like a beer?
4666292	eng	Won't Tom ever come back?
4666293	eng	Why wouldn't it work now?
4666294	eng	Why would people do this?
4666295	eng	Why would Tom be worried?
4666296	eng	Why should Tom even care?
4666297	eng	Why is it so complicated?
4666298	eng	Why hasn't Tom called me?
4666301	eng	Who could that have been?
4666302	eng	Who cares what Tom wears?
4666303	eng	When did they build that?
4666305	eng	What else could you want?
4666306	eng	What could Tom have done?
4666307	eng	We're going back to work.
4666309	eng	We were caught off guard.
4666310	eng	We still need to compete.
4666311	eng	We need to change course.
4666312	eng	We just don't believe it.
4666313	eng	We just couldn't do that.
4666314	eng	We intend to change that.
4666317	eng	We can't do that anymore.
4666319	eng	Tom's house is very nice.
4666321	eng	Tom wouldn't let me quit.

4666383	eng	Tom had better get going.
4666386	eng	Tom got the answer right.
4666387	eng	Tom drove a hard bargain.

4666446	eng	Some dreams do come true.
4666448	eng	No one could go anywhere.

4666480	eng	I couldn't do that again.
4666481	eng	I couldn't be more proud.
4666483	eng	I could probably do that.
4666484	eng	I believe lying is wrong.
4666485	eng	I almost caught the ball.
4666486	eng	How would that be better?
4666487	eng	How will you change this?
4666488	eng	How have you been coping?
4666489	eng	How could they forget us?

4666499	eng	Don't tell Tom the truth.
4666501	eng	Don't let Tom touch this.

4666507	eng	Bring some cash with you.
4666508	eng	Be original for a change.
4666509	eng	Are you ready to compete?
4666511	eng	All this has now changed.

4666514	eng	You would be safe there.
4666515	eng	You can vote for change.
4666516	eng	Would that be all right?
4666517	eng	Why would you leave now?
4666518	eng	Why is Tom holding back?
4666519	eng	Why didn't you buy that?
4666520	eng	Who would want this job?
4666521	eng	Who says change is good?
4666522	eng	Who cares where Tom was?
4666523	eng	Were you born in Boston?

4666608	eng	Tom could never do that.
4666609	eng	Tom could barely sit up.
4666610	eng	Tom clearly has a point.
4666612	eng	Tom can't make me leave.
4666614	eng	Tom can drive, can't he?
4666615	eng	Tom came in third place.
4666616	eng	Tom called 911 for help.
4666620	eng	This would help I think.
4666621	eng	This is a major concern.
4666626	eng	The law is pretty clear.
4666627	eng	The game begins at 2:30.
4666628	eng	The fire has burned out.
4666629	eng	That's how it all began.
4666630	eng	That's how I was raised.
4666632	eng	That would take all day.
4666635	eng	Please say hello to Tom.
4666636	eng	Please come and join us.
4666637	eng	Mary is a good waitress.
4666641	eng	It won't change a thing.
4666642	eng	It was a radical change.
4666643	eng	It was a costly mistake.
4666644	eng	It was a confusing time.
4666645	eng	It could be very costly.
4666646	eng	I'm just happy I'm back.

4666655	eng	I saw Tom briefly today.
4666656	eng	I need some new clothes.
4666657	eng	I love coming back here.
4666658	eng	I just couldn't do that.
4666659	eng	I hate doing this stuff.
4666661	eng	I don't believe in that.
4666662	eng	I couldn't sleep at all.
4666663	eng	I couldn't deal with it.
4666664	eng	I called Tom right away.
4666665	eng	I called Tom for advice.
4666666	eng	I believe this is wrong.
4666667	eng	I become a member today.
4666669	eng	I barely knew my father.
4666670	eng	How would you change it?
4666671	eng	How much will this cost?
4666672	eng	How much will that cost?
4666674	eng	How could you forget it?
4666675	eng	How could we improve it?
4666676	eng	How could they be wrong?
4666677	eng	Help me move this couch.
4666678	eng	Have you seen Tom dance?
4666680	eng	Don't tell Tom about it.

4666692	eng	Do you want to continue?
4666693	eng	Do you still read books?
4666694	eng	Do you have any concern?
4666698	eng	Both sides are to blame.
4666704	eng	You may close the door.
4666705	eng	Why would they do this?
4666707	eng	Who cares what Tom did?
4666708	eng	When will Tom get home?
4666709	eng	What would the cost be?
4666712	eng	We're bound to get wet.
4666713	eng	We'll get back to that.
4666714	eng	We would never do that.
4666715	eng	We want to change that.
4666716	eng	We have to change that.

4666741	eng	Tom is going to prison.
4666742	eng	Tom is due back Monday.
4666744	eng	Tom is afraid, I think.
4666745	eng	Tom is a terrible cook.

4666776	eng	Tom could be in danger.
4666777	eng	Tom could be in Boston.
4666778	eng	Tom could be at school.
4666780	eng	Tom claims he was busy.
4666781	eng	Tom can't ride a horse.
4666782	eng	Tom can't go right now.
4666783	eng	Tom can't come in here.
4666788	eng	This is a real concern.
4666789	eng	The vote will be close.
4666790	eng	The costs are too high.
4666792	eng	That's what I would do.
4666793	eng	That would be the best.
4666799	eng	That concerns me a lot.
4666800	eng	Take care of your back.
4666801	eng	No one except Tom came.
4666802	eng	No one can protect you.
4666803	eng	No one came except Tom.

4666809	eng	Is this a real concern?
4666812	eng	I'm not taking the bet.
4666813	eng	I'm not a happy camper.

4666818	eng	I thought we could win.
4666819	eng	I thought Tom liked me.
4666820	eng	I think Tom could help.
4666821	eng	I slammed on my brakes.
4666822	eng	I hope Tom was kidding.
4666823	eng	I don't cook every day.
4666824	eng	I couldn't get it done.
4666826	eng	I could help you there.
4666827	eng	I broke down and cried.
4666828	eng	How long would it take?
4666829	eng	How hard could that be?
4666830	eng	How do you change that?
4666831	eng	How could I have known?
4666832	eng	How close is too close?

4666842	eng	Did you visit the camp?
4666843	eng	Did you ever catch Tom?
4666845	eng	Could Tom have done it?
4666846	eng	Change is what we need.
4666848	eng	Why is change so hard?
4666849	eng	Why is Tom blaming us?
4666850	eng	What more could we do?
4666852	eng	We want a real change.
4666853	eng	We tried to catch Tom.
4666854	eng	We need to be careful.
4666855	eng	We have to correct it.
4666860	eng	Tom would be so happy.
4666861	eng	Tom won't go, will he?
4666863	eng	Tom will pay the bill.
4666864	eng	Tom should do it soon.

4666907	eng	Tom can't go home now.
4666911	eng	Tom always lies to me.
4666914	eng	This is a big concern.
4666916	eng	That would be so cool.
4666917	eng	That may be a concern.
4666919	eng	That costs a lot more.
4666920	eng	Not all change is bad.
4666921	eng	May I speak in French?
4666922	eng	Mary is a good mother.
4666928	eng	I would vote for that.
4666930	eng	I want a new contract.
4666931	eng	I knew Tom would lose.
4666932	eng	I hope they catch Tom.
4666935	eng	I don't really buy it.

4666957	eng	You need to eat more.
4666958	eng	Would it be worth it?
4666960	eng	Why don't you buy it?
4666961	eng	Who am I to complain?
4666962	eng	When can I come over?
4666963	eng	What else would I do?
4666964	eng	We have to catch Tom.
4666965	eng	We did what we could.

4667051	eng	I hope Tom trusts me.
4667053	eng	I bet Tom was hungry.
4667054	eng	I began to get angry.

4879989	eng	It wasn't even a disappointment.
4879990	eng	I hope you aren't disappointed.
4879991	eng	The loss was a disappointment.
4879992	eng	That's why I was disappointed.
4879994	eng	It was disappointing to lose.
4879995	eng	I'm sure Tom is disappointed.
4879996	eng	I'm not disappointed in that.
4879998	eng	No one will be disappointed.
4879999	eng	It was a disappointing loss.
4880000	eng	How can you be disappointed?
4880001	eng	It's OK to be disappointed.
4880003	eng	All of us are disappointed.
4880011	eng	Tom is very distinguished looking.
4880012	eng	I found it very disturbing.
4880013	eng	Tom isn't to be disturbed.
4880014	eng	Sorry to have disturbed you.
4880120	eng	I can't keep it in.
4880139	eng	Some people are very rude.
4880149	eng	Some people are really intelligent.
4881178	eng	We've had discussions about that.
4881179	eng	We haven't even discussed that.
4881180	eng	That's still up for discussion.
4881183	eng	We haven't even discussed it.
4881184	eng	Tom will lead the discussion.
4881185	eng	I can't really discuss that.
4881186	eng	We didn't even discuss it.
4881187	eng	There's a lot to discuss.
4881214	eng	We helped on the farm.
4881838	eng	Oppressive regimes don't live forever.
4883568	eng	My dog won't stop snoring.
4884636	eng	Babies don't stay babies forever.
4887767	eng	I did a terrible job.
4887768	eng	How will you do that?
4887769	eng	How much did we lose?
4887770	eng	How many do you have?
4887771	eng	How is Tom doing now?
4887772	eng	How do you rank that?
4887773	eng	How did you get that?
4887774	eng	How did they do this?
4887775	eng	How did they do that?
4887776	eng	How can we do better?
4887777	eng	Do we really need it?
4887778	eng	Did you vote for Tom?
4887779	eng	Did Tom win the race?
4887780	eng	Did Tom get a chance?
4887781	eng	Can we do this again?
4887782	eng	Can this be done now?
4887783	eng	You have to do that.
4887784	eng	What can we do next?
4887786	eng	Maybe Tom can do it.
4887787	eng	It's not easy to do.
4887788	eng	I'm glad Tom did it.
4887789	eng	I'm glad I did that.
4887790	eng	I wanted to do more.
4887791	eng	I really do love it.
4887792	eng	I really do like it.
4887793	eng	I forgot what to do.
4887794	eng	I don't own a horse.
4887795	eng	I don't drive a car.
4887796	eng	I do this every day.
4887798	eng	I didn't do my best.
4887799	eng	I did my best today.
4887800	eng	How do we help them?
4887801	eng	How do we get there?
4887802	eng	How did Tom move it?
4887803	eng	Do we need Tom, too?
4887804	eng	Where do we go now?
4887805	eng	What help do I get?
4887806	eng	What do you all do?
4887807	eng	We need to do this.
4887808	eng	We need to do more.
4887809	eng	We need to do both.
4887810	eng	We love what we do.
4887811	eng	We know who did it.
4887812	eng	We intend to do so.
4887814	eng	Tom did a fine job.
4887815	eng	That was fun to do.
4887816	eng	I think I did that.
4887817	eng	I hope you do well.
4887818	eng	I hope Tom does it.
4887819	eng	I don't walk a lot.
4887820	eng	I don't own a suit.
4887821	eng	I don't know my IQ.
4887822	eng	I did it last year.
4887823	eng	I can help do that.
4887824	eng	Do it your own way.
4887825	eng	Can we do it again?
4887826	eng	Can Tom do the job?
4887827	eng	You do work a lot.
4887828	eng	Why do we need it?
4887829	eng	Which way do I go?
4887831	eng	We had to do that.
4887834	eng	We did a good job.
4887835	eng	Tom used to do it.
4887836	eng	Tom can do it all.
4887837	eng	It's all I can do.
4887838	eng	I've got to do it.
4887839	eng	I'm able to do it.
4887840	eng	I wanted to do it.
4887841	eng	I want to do more.
4887842	eng	I used to do that.
4887843	eng	I just did my job.
4887844	eng	I intend to do so.
4887845	eng	I hope they do it.
4887846	eng	I have to do that.
4887847	eng	I enjoy what I do.
4887849	eng	I do my own thing.
4887850	eng	I can't do it yet.
4887851	eng	I can do it today.
4887852	eng	How much do I get?
4887853	eng	Go do as you like.
4887856	eng	How do we fix it?
4887857	eng	How do I sign up?
4887858	eng	How do I get one?
4887859	eng	Do you eat a lot?
4888454	eng	I had fun doing this.
4888455	eng	I really do enjoy it.
4888456	eng	I'll have to do that.
4888457	eng	I'm ready to do that.
4888458	eng	Just do what you can.
4888459	eng	That's how we did it.
4888460	eng	That's how you do it.
4888461	eng	Tom can't do the job.
4888462	eng	Tom did his job well.
4888463	eng	Tom did it all alone.
4888464	eng	Tom did it last year.
4888465	eng	Tom has things to do.
4888466	eng	Tom needs to do more.
4888467	eng	We all can do better.
4888468	eng	We can all do better.
4888469	eng	We can get that done.
4888470	eng	We can't do it again.
4888471	eng	We can't do that now.
4888472	eng	We want to do better.
4888473	eng	We won't do it again.
4888475	eng	What can I do better?
4888476	eng	What more can you do?
4888477	eng	Why can't we do both?
4888478	eng	Why did they do this?
4888479	eng	Why do you need that?
4888480	eng	You don't need a gun.
4888481	eng	Did you all know that?
4888482	eng	Do you feel safe here?
4888483	eng	Do you miss your kids?
4888484	eng	Do you need any money?
4888485	eng	Do you still miss Tom?
4888487	eng	I don't feel that way.
4888488	eng	I don't have any pain.
4888489	eng	I love what I'm doing.
4888491	eng	I'm glad Tom did that.
4888492	eng	I'm unable to do that.
4888493	eng	It didn't go too well.
4888494	eng	Let's see Tom do that.
4888495	eng	Somebody has to do it.
4888496	eng	That's not easy to do.
4888497	eng	That's not what we do.
4888498	eng	Tom doesn't own a car.
4888499	eng	Tom failed to do that.
4888500	eng	Tom is doing his part.
4888501	eng	Tom is doing that now.
4888502	eng	Tom might do the same.
4888503	eng	Tom promised to do so.
4888504	eng	We can do much better.
4888505	eng	We did that very well.
4888506	eng	We don't want to move.
4888507	eng	We don't want to wait.
4888508	eng	We only did that once.
4888509	eng	We're able to do that.
4888510	eng	What do you miss most?
4888511	eng	Why do people do this?
4888512	eng	Why does Tom hate you?
4888513	eng	Why don't you stop it?
4888514	eng	You can't do that now.
4888515	eng	Do we really want that?
4888516	eng	Do you think I'm funny?
4888517	eng	Do you want a sandwich?
4888518	eng	Don't give up too soon.
4888519	eng	Don't let Tom fool you.
4888520	eng	Don't tell me, show me.
4888521	eng	How did this all start?
4888523	eng	How did you learn that?
4888524	eng	How much does Tom make?
4888526	eng	I didn't plan for this.
4888527	eng	I don't know the facts.
4888528	eng	I don't mind the noise.
4888529	eng	I don't need much else.
4888530	eng	I don't think it helps.
4888532	eng	I just don't have time.
4888533	eng	I really do think that.
4888534	eng	I still don't have one.
4888535	eng	I still don't want one.
4888536	eng	I think I've done well.
4888537	eng	I think it does matter.
4888538	eng	I'll just do it myself.
4888539	eng	I'm just doing my duty.
4888540	eng	It's really hard to do.
4888541	eng	That's very hard to do.
4888542	eng	The job's not done yet.
4889026	eng	This is not a dog.
4889130	eng	I would not do that.
4889152	eng	You cannot stay here tonight.
4889162	eng	Okay! Do you all understand?
4889168	eng	I am only a customer.
4889181	eng	My attempt gave no result.
4889495	eng	I still think of him.
4889496	eng	I still think of her.
4889500	eng	Tom doesn't like his sandwich.
4889630	eng	My friend went to Gothenburg.
4889688	eng	Tom did a fabulous job.
4889689	eng	Tom did a superior job.
4889690	eng	Tom did a terrific job.
4889691	eng	Tom didn't speak to me.
4889692	eng	Tom is doing good work.
4889693	eng	Tom likes what he does.
4889694	eng	Tom loves what he does.
4889695	eng	Tom never did it again.
4889696	eng	Tom really did do well.
4889697	eng	Tom refused to do that.
4889698	eng	Tom wants to do better.
4889699	eng	We can do without that.
4889700	eng	We don't need any more.
4889701	eng	We don't need to fight.
4889702	eng	We had to do something.
4889703	eng	We've done what we can.
4889704	eng	What did Tom give Mary?
4889705	eng	What do you need today?
4889706	eng	What'll you do with it?
4889707	eng	Where did it all start?
4889708	eng	Why does Tom need that?
4889709	eng	You can do much better.
4889710	eng	Are you still in school?
4889711	eng	Can it actually be done?
4889712	eng	Can we do this together?
4889713	eng	Did you feel safe there?
4889714	eng	Do you have any regrets?
4889715	eng	Does Tom really do that?
4889716	eng	Don't be afraid to fail.
4889717	eng	Don't ever give up hope.
4889718	eng	Don't quit your day job.
4889719	eng	How did that all happen?
4889720	eng	How did this effect you?
4889721	eng	How does Tom make money?
4889722	eng	I did what was expected.
4889723	eng	I did what was required.
4889724	eng	I didn't even know that.
4889725	eng	I didn't read the story.
4889726	eng	I didn't think about it.
4889727	eng	I do think there's hope.
4889728	eng	I don't do that anymore.
4889729	eng	I don't do those things.
4889730	eng	I don't want to comment.
4889731	eng	I guess you didn't know.
4889732	eng	I honestly don't get it.
4889733	eng	I hope Tom doesn't mind.
4889734	eng	I like what you've done.
4889735	eng	I wish it didn't matter.
4889736	eng	Let's get this job done.
4889737	eng	Let's not do that again.
4889738	eng	That's what I did today.
4889739	eng	They don't want us here.
4889740	eng	This is difficult to do.
4889741	eng	Tom did a fantastic job.
4889742	eng	Tom did a wonderful job.
4889743	eng	Tom didn't get his wish.
4889744	eng	Tom didn't get the memo.
4889745	eng	Tom didn't grow up here.
4889746	eng	Tom didn't seem to mind.
4889747	eng	Tom didn't want my help.
4889748	eng	Tom has already done it.
4889749	eng	Tom has done it already.
4889750	eng	Tom has never done that.
4889752	eng	Tom promised to do that.
4889753	eng	Tom will enjoy doing it.
4889754	eng	We both did really well.
4889755	eng	We can always do better.
4889756	eng	We can definitely do it.
4889757	eng	We can do without those.
4889758	eng	We can surely do better.
4889759	eng	We do have some options.
4889760	eng	We do this every Monday.
4889761	eng	We don't always do that.
4889762	eng	We don't have any rules.
4889763	eng	We don't practice a lot.
4889764	eng	We don't sell junk food.
4889765	eng	What Tom did is illegal.
4889766	eng	What advice do you have?
4889767	eng	What are we doing wrong?
4889768	eng	What did the company do?
4889769	eng	What do you enjoy doing?
4889770	eng	What has Tom done wrong?
4889771	eng	What should we focus on?
4889772	eng	What'll Tom do about it?
4889773	eng	Who doesn't want to win?
4889774	eng	Why didn't they tell us?
4889775	eng	Why didn't you hire Tom?
4889776	eng	Why don't you go inside?
4889777	eng	Why don't you want this?
4889778	eng	Why don't you write Tom?
4889779	eng	Are you still doing that?
4889780	eng	At least I did something.
4889781	eng	Can you do this yourself?
4889782	eng	Did you really mean that?
4889783	eng	Do you guys use Facebook?
4889784	eng	Do you like being famous?
4889785	eng	Do you really need these?
4889786	eng	Do you see a resemblance?
4889787	eng	Do you still play tennis?
4889801	eng	The website was undergoing maintenance.
4889817	eng	He is a modern boy.
4889833	eng	What are you doing, darling?
4889852	eng	I like to be alone.
4889878	eng	Do you still write music?
4889879	eng	Does Tom still live here?
4889880	eng	Does Tom still work here?
4889881	eng	Don't feel sorry for Tom.
4889882	eng	Don't let that worry you.
4889883	eng	Everyone knew what to do.
4889884	eng	How did Tom get involved?
4889885	eng	How did this get started?
4889886	eng	How much don't they know?
4889887	eng	I didn't expect all this.
4889888	eng	I didn't like doing that.
4889889	eng	I don't have any regrets.
4889890	eng	I don't know what's best.
4889891	eng	I don't like working out.
4889892	eng	I don't really need that.
4889893	eng	I don't think about that.
4889894	eng	I don't think that works.
4889895	eng	I really just don't know.
4889897	eng	I'm not doing that today.
4889898	eng	It didn't need to happen.
4889899	eng	Our work here isn't done.
4889900	eng	Please don't let us down.
4889901	eng	That's not what Tom does.
4889902	eng	That's really hard to do.
4889903	eng	The fun didn't last long.
4889904	eng	The work is getting done.
4889905	eng	They're doing a good job.
4889906	eng	Tom did a phenomenal job.
4889907	eng	Tom did some good things.
4889908	eng	Tom didn't say very much.
4889909	eng	Tom didn't talk too much.
4889910	eng	Tom didn't want us there.
4889911	eng	Tom doesn't plan to wait.
4889912	eng	Tom has done really well.
4889913	eng	Tom hasn't done that yet.
4889914	eng	Tom isn't quite done yet.
4889916	eng	Tom says he doesn't mind.
4889917	eng	Tom still doesn't get it.
4889918	eng	We didn't talk very much.
4889919	eng	We don't need that stuff.
4889920	eng	We don't really know why.
4889921	eng	We haven't done that yet.
4889922	eng	We just didn't do enough.
4889923	eng	We just didn't expect it.
4889924	eng	We'll always do our best.
4889925	eng	What did Tom actually do?
4889926	eng	Why aren't we doing that?
4889927	eng	Why isn't Tom doing this?
4889928	eng	I don't like working here.
4889930	eng	Maybe Tom doesn't like me.
4889934	eng	I'm glad you're doing well.
4889938	eng	Why didn't you do anything?
4889939	eng	Do you see any similarities?
4889943	eng	Are you still playing tennis?
4889946	eng	The meeting didn't last long.
4890058	eng	What do you want, anyway?
4890059	eng	What has Tom done lately?
4890060	eng	Where do your folks live?
4890061	eng	You can do that tomorrow.
4890062	eng	You'd better do that now.
4890064	eng	Can anything else be done?
4890065	eng	Did I miss something here?
4890066	eng	Do you guys understand me?
4890067	eng	Do you have hard evidence?
4890068	eng	Does Tom really want this?
4890069	eng	I didn't even notice that.
4890070	eng	I don't feel safe anymore.
4890071	eng	I don't have any comments.
4890072	eng	I don't have any symptoms.
4890073	eng	I don't have many regrets.
4890074	eng	I don't know why, exactly.
4890075	eng	I don't like cold weather.
4890076	eng	I don't remember for sure.
4890077	eng	I don't remember that day.
4890078	eng	I think we're doing great.
4890081	eng	It didn't make much sense.
4890082	eng	Tom didn't need much help.
4890083	eng	Tom doesn't plan to leave.
4890084	eng	Tom has done his homework.
4890085	eng	We don't really feel safe.
4890086	eng	We don't think it matters.
4890087	eng	What Tom did was horrible.
4890088	eng	What do you suggest doing?
4890089	eng	What else do you remember?
4890090	eng	What exactly did you mean?
4890091	eng	What exactly does it mean?
4890092	eng	What exactly has Tom done?
4890093	eng	I actually didn't say that.
4890094	eng	I can do everything myself.
4890095	eng	I didn't see anything else.
4890096	eng	Most people don't think so.
4890097	eng	Something needs to be done.
4890098	eng	Something's got to be done.
4890099	eng	That didn't help very much.
4890102	eng	That's exactly what we did.
4890103	eng	Tom certainly did his part.
4890104	eng	Tom did an outstanding job.
4890106	eng	Tom didn't even mention it.
4890107	eng	Tom didn't lose his temper.
4890108	eng	What Tom did was disgusting.
4890150	eng	That didn't use to happen.
4890252	eng	Tom didn't want to comment.
4890253	eng	Tom doesn't like us either.
4890254	eng	Tom forgot to do something.
4890255	eng	Tom knows what we're doing.
4890256	eng	We don't need these things.
4890257	eng	We don't think that's true.
4890258	eng	We don't want that anymore.
4890259	eng	We don't want to overreact.
4890260	eng	What does it matter anyhow?
4890261	eng	What does it really matter?
4890262	eng	What you're doing is wrong.
4890328	eng	I'm too old to dance.
4890356	eng	Why does that interest you?
4890357	eng	Why does this surprise you?
4890359	eng	Did anyone else notice this?
4890360	eng	Do you have any predictions?
4890361	eng	Does Tom have anything left?
4890363	eng	Everybody wanted to do that.
4890364	eng	Everyone did a fabulous job.
4890365	eng	Exactly what does that mean?
4890373	eng	How does that actually work?
4890374	eng	How does this always happen?
4890375	eng	I certainly don't regret it.
4890376	eng	I didn't even recognize Tom.
4890377	eng	I didn't know what happened.
4890378	eng	I don't personally know Tom.
4890379	eng	I don't want that happening.
4890380	eng	I just don't understand Tom.
4890381	eng	I personally don't think so.
4890392	eng	I'm doing what I can.
4890394	eng	We haven't done too badly.
4890395	eng	We might actually do that.
4890396	eng	It really doesn't seem fair.
4890397	eng	Let's do the exact opposite.
4890398	eng	Maybe you're doing it wrong.
4890399	eng	Our business is doing great.
4890400	eng	Personally, I don't like it.
4890401	eng	Some people don't like that.
4890402	eng	Some things didn't work out.
4890403	eng	That's all we've been doing.
4890404	eng	That's exactly what Tom did.
4890405	eng	That's what smart people do.
4890406	eng	That's what we're doing now.
4890407	eng	They can't do anything else.
4890408	eng	They're doing what they can.
4890409	eng	Tom actually did it himself.
4890410	eng	Tom didn't do anything else.
4890411	eng	Tom didn't move fast enough.
4890412	eng	Tom does everything so well.
4890413	eng	Tom does make things happen.
4890414	eng	Tom obviously doesn't get it.
4890415	eng	This doesn't happen every day.
4890420	eng	Tom doesn't owe us anything.
4890421	eng	We don't have any questions.
4890422	eng	We don't make many mistakes.
4890423	eng	We don't think it's serious.
4890424	eng	What difference did it make?
4890425	eng	What's Tom doing these days?
4890426	eng	Why do school grades matter?
4890427	eng	Did anybody else notice this?
4890428	eng	Did you expect anything else?
4890429	eng	Do you like watching sports?
4890430	eng	Do you have any disabilities?
4890431	eng	Do you have trouble sleeping?
4890432	eng	Does anyone see a difference?
4890433	eng	I definitely don't regret it.
4890434	eng	I don't mind reading manuals.
4890435	eng	I don't think it's necessary.
4890439	eng	I'll do whatever I can.
4890440	eng	We'll do whatever we can.
4890441	eng	I didn't really enjoy that.
4890442	eng	We've been doing just fine.
4890443	eng	We've done the right thing.
4890444	eng	Tom didn't show me anything.
4890446	eng	We didn't do much yesterday.
4890447	eng	It's just doesn't seem right.
4890448	eng	That just doesn't make sense.
4890450	eng	That's something Tom must do.
4890451	eng	That's what Tom usually does.
4890452	eng	The article doesn't say that.
4890453	eng	They'll do whatever they can.
4890454	eng	They've done the right thing.
4890455	eng	Tom didn't do much yesterday.
4890456	eng	Tom didn't go into specifics.
4890457	eng	Tom definitely didn't do that.
4890522	eng	Valentine's Day is coming up.
4890570	eng	I like all my friends.
4890772	eng	We don't want your money.
4890773	eng	I really enjoyed doing that.
4890775	eng	I don't trust anyone anymore.
4890776	eng	They're just doing their job.
4890777	eng	Tom doesn't know much either.
4890779	eng	Tom doesn't watch war movies.
4890780	eng	Tom is doing something right.
4890781	eng	We didn't take anything home.
4890782	eng	We're not doing anything new.
4890783	eng	We've had success doing that.
4890784	eng	What does this mean, exactly?
4890785	eng	What they did was incredible.
4890786	eng	You don't drink enough water.
4890787	eng	I didn't expect these results.
4890788	eng	I don't particularly like Tom.
4890789	eng	I don't think it's reasonable.
4890790	eng	I don't watch much basketball.
4890791	eng	I really didn't understand it.
4890792	eng	I really don't understand why.
4890793	eng	I still don't understand this.
4890794	eng	I'll probably stop doing that.
4890795	eng	I'm actually doing quite well.
4890796	eng	Some things just don't matter.
4890797	eng	That doesn't surprise me much.
4890798	eng	Things didn't happen that way.
4890799	eng	Tom didn't sit around waiting.
4890800	eng	Tom doesn't even like driving.
4890801	eng	Tom doesn't need a wheelchair.
4890802	eng	Tom hasn't made much progress.
4890803	eng	What difference does this make?
4890804	eng	What do these statistics mean?
4890805	eng	Don't leave the engine running.
4890806	eng	It doesn't happen much anymore.
4890807	eng	It doesn't make economic sense.
4890808	eng	That doesn't happen very often.
4890809	eng	They're doing it by themselves.
4890810	eng	This doesn't happen very often.
4890811	eng	Tom doesn't struggle like this.
4890812	eng	Tom seldom talks about himself.
4890813	eng	We don't have that information.
4890814	eng	We don't know what's happening.
4890815	eng	We don't make anything anymore.
4890816	eng	We don't want any distractions.
4890817	eng	Tom didn't take much persuading.
4890818	eng	We don't have enough information.
4890859	eng	Tom didn't promise me anything.
4890860	eng	What does everybody else think?
4890861	eng	You'll regret what you've done.
4890862	eng	You're probably doing it wrong.
4890863	eng	I don't totally understand that.
4890864	eng	That didn't surprise me, either.
4890865	eng	Tom finally did something right.
4890866	eng	Tom is doing extraordinary work.
4890867	eng	Tom wasn't doing anything wrong.
4890868	eng	We weren't doing anything wrong.
4891905	eng	Prices right now are sky-high.
4892263	eng	Fear and panic overwhelmed me.
4892604	eng	What is your totem animal?
4892694	eng	Mary's apartment is very tidy.
4895144	eng	Do you like your keyboard?
4895469	eng	Learn from Comrade Lei Feng.
4895488	eng	Let Tom finish his sentence.
4895490	eng	Let me finish my sentence.
4895550	eng	Tom is pompous and arrogant.
4895618	eng	This is a terrible tragedy.
4896023	eng	Esperanto has only two cases.
4896857	eng	His webpage is in Esperanto.
4897515	eng	I don't accept your arguments.
4897590	eng	She drank the expired milk.
4898911	eng	Intelligent animals can help people.
4900615	eng	Tom is having dinner now.
4900620	eng	That's exactly what I'm doing.
4900621	eng	Tom didn't practice on Monday.
4900623	eng	We don't regret that decision.
4900624	eng	Will they play together again?
4900626	eng	Tom isn't doing anything wrong.
4900627	eng	That's exactly what Tom's doing.
4900628	eng	Tom is doing exceptionally well.
4900629	eng	I didn't feel particularly happy.
4900630	eng	I don't understand this decision.
4900631	eng	I'm not doing anything different.
4900632	eng	It sounds incredible, doesn't it?
4900633	eng	My opinion doesn't really matter.
4900634	eng	My opinion really doesn't matter.
4900635	eng	That doesn't sound too difficult.
4900636	eng	That's exactly what you're doing.
4900637	eng	That's something I've never done.
4900638	eng	They aren't doing anything wrong.
4900639	eng	They haven't done anything wrong.
4900640	eng	They're not doing anything wrong.
4900641	eng	We aren't doing anything tonight.
4900642	eng	We're not doing anything tonight.
4900643	eng	What happened didn't surprise me.
4900644	eng	Did someone actually propose this?
4900645	eng	I didn't feel particularly hungry.
4900646	eng	I don't understand your complaint.
4900647	eng	People don't trust the government.
4900648	eng	Something just doesn't seem right.
4900649	eng	That doesn't happen just anywhere.
4900650	eng	That's exactly what they're doing.
4900652	eng	That's what they don't understand.
4900653	eng	These things don't happen quickly.
4900654	eng	They weren't doing anything wrong.
4900655	eng	They're doing everything they can.
4900656	eng	Tom didn't mention specific dates.
4900657	eng	Tom doesn't take things seriously.
4900658	eng	Tom doesn't think it's impossible.
4900659	eng	Tom doesn't watch much television.
4900660	eng	Tom is doing significantly better.
4900661	eng	Tom usually doesn't make mistakes.
4900662	eng	Don't waste money on nonessentials.
4900663	eng	Everybody knows what they're doing.
4900664	eng	Everything else doesn't matter now.
4900665	eng	I didn't feel particularly nervous.
4900666	eng	I didn't immediately understand it.
4900667	eng	I didn't notice anything different.
4900668	eng	Perhaps you don't understand fully.
4900669	eng	Tom didn't provide any explanation.
4900671	eng	You didn't mention having children.
4900672	eng	You weren't doing anything illegal.
4900673	eng	Are you doing something differently?
4900674	eng	Please don't insult my intelligence.
4900675	eng	That strategy obviously didn't work.
4900676	eng	That's what people don't understand.
4900677	eng	What's the competition doing better?
4900678	eng	Everything Tom does is controversial.
4900679	eng	Please don't insult our intelligence.
4900680	eng	Tom didn't require medical treatment.
4901183	eng	She behaves obsequiously toward superiors.
4901247	eng	Writers often use a pseudonym.
4901276	eng	We drink everything except water.
4902614	eng	That's not a real word.
4902635	eng	Tom doubled over with pain.
4902654	eng	Tom was secretly very excited.
4902656	eng	Mary was secretly very excited.
4902691	eng	This bed is very comfortable.
4902694	eng	This bed is not comfortable.
4902723	eng	I sort of doubt it.
4902725	eng	I doubt Tom knows Mary.
4902726	eng	I doubt anyone said that.
4902727	eng	Was there ever any doubt?
4902729	eng	Tom started to doubt himself.
4902732	eng	It was a dramatic moment.
4902733	eng	I still dream about it.
4902734	eng	I still dream about you.
4902735	eng	Isn't talking about dreams boring?
4902736	eng	I wore the white dress.
4902737	eng	Mary wore a white dress.
4902738	eng	Mary was wearing a dress.
4902739	eng	I drink wine every day.
4902740	eng	They ate and they drank.
4902741	eng	We have no drinking water.
4902743	eng	Cold drinks will be served.
4902745	eng	Were you drinking that day?
4902746	eng	Get these folks some drinks.
4902747	eng	Drinking isn't against the law.
4902750	eng	Tom drives an older car.
4902751	eng	Are you a taxi driver?
4902752	eng	I hope Tom isn't driving.
4902754	eng	Tom won't drive at night.
4902755	eng	Tom drove to the hospital.
4902756	eng	Tom never learned to drive.
4902758	eng	I'm going to drive downtown.
4902761	eng	The truck driver wasn't injured.
4902763	eng	Mary is drop dead gorgeous.
4902764	eng	Promise you'll drop by tonight.
4902765	eng	Is Tom able to eat?
4902766	eng	We like to eat out.
4902767	eng	I like to eat out.
4902768	eng	Tom likes to eat out.
4902769	eng	Tom ate all the cookies.
4902770	eng	We're going to eat now.
4902771	eng	I just eat bananas now.
4902772	eng	Tom usually eats lunch alone.
4902773	eng	Sometimes people eat too fast.
4902776	eng	What's everyone eating for lunch?
4902777	eng	Tom is an education major.
4902778	eng	I have a college education.
4902779	eng	I'm embarrassed for us both.
4902780	eng	It was a little embarrassing.
4902781	eng	Our company has thirty employees.
4902782	eng	Almost nobody is unemployed now.
4902783	eng	They treat their employees well.
4902784	eng	The place is nearly empty.
4902785	eng	The store is almost empty.
4902786	eng	The waiting room is empty.
4902787	eng	The beach was fairly empty.
4902789	eng	The reception room is empty.
4902790	eng	There are still empty seats.
4902791	eng	How will it all end?
4902792	eng	How will this all end?
4902793	eng	Tom wants to end this.
4902794	eng	When will it ever end?
4902795	eng	Where will Tom end up?
4902796	eng	Tom ended up in prison.
4902797	eng	We're at our wits' end.
4902798	eng	When will this all end?
4902799	eng	The term ends next week.
4902800	eng	Where will all this end?
4902802	eng	Tom ended up going himself.
4902804	eng	The ending wasn't a surprise.
4902805	eng	Tom ended up committing suicide.
4902806	eng	Tom has endured a lot.
4902807	eng	We've endured for long enough.
4902808	eng	Tom is an engineer now.
4902809	eng	I enjoyed it a lot.
4902812	eng	Tom said he enjoyed it.
4902814	eng	I really enjoyed this week.
4902815	eng	It was an enjoyable week.
4902816	eng	I really enjoyed that movie.
4902817	eng	I enjoyed watching the game.
4902819	eng	I actually enjoyed the movie.
4902820	eng	I enjoyed being in Boston.
4902821	eng	I've enjoyed working with Tom.
4902822	eng	People need to enjoy themselves.
4902823	eng	I thoroughly enjoyed myself here.
4902824	eng	It was definitely very enjoyable.
4902827	eng	Please use the north entrance.
4902828	eng	I'm excited to be here.
4902829	eng	We were all so excited.
4902830	eng	This is an exciting day.
4902831	eng	I was excited about that.
4902832	eng	That was exciting to see.
4902834	eng	Next year will be exciting.
4902835	eng	Tom was excited about that.
4902837	eng	There's a lot of excitement.
4902838	eng	There's excitement in the air.
4902839	eng	They're very excited about it.
4902840	eng	This is really exciting stuff.
4902841	eng	We're pretty excited about it.
4902842	eng	We're really excited about it.
4902843	eng	We're pretty excited about that.
4902844	eng	I'm excited about this opportunity.
4902845	eng	We're excited about the possibilities.
4902846	eng	You must excuse me now.
4902848	eng	These are really just excuses.
4902849	eng	Take it easy when exercising.
4902850	eng	Tom prefers walking for exercise.
4902851	eng	Can you expand on that?
4902852	eng	There's no room to expand.
4902853	eng	We expect to be busy.
4902854	eng	I expect that as well.
4902855	eng	I knew what to expect.
4902858	eng	I expect a tough fight.
4902859	eng	I expected a big crowd.
4902860	eng	Were you expecting to win?
4902861	eng	We knew what to expect.
4902862	eng	We know what to expect.
4902863	eng	Expect more of the same.
4902864	eng	I never expected to win.
4902865	eng	Is it what you expected?
4902866	eng	Tom knew what to expect.
4902867	eng	What else can we expect?
4902868	eng	I never expected to lose.
4902869	eng	We expect more than that.
4902870	eng	We kind of expected this.
4902872	eng	It was kind of unexpected.
4902873	eng	That's all you can expect.
4902874	eng	I just wasn't expecting it.
4902875	eng	It was a little unexpected.
4902876	eng	This isn't what we expected.
4902877	eng	This wasn't what I expected.
4902878	eng	Tom wasn't expected to live.
4902880	eng	Nobody's expecting us to win.
4902882	eng	People expect things from us.
4902883	eng	Tom is expected to recover.
4902885	eng	What else were you expecting?
4902886	eng	I expect no special treatment.
4902888	eng	Is that something you expected?
4902889	eng	That decision is expected soon.
4902890	eng	What exactly were you expecting?
4902891	eng	We won't lower our expectations.
4902892	eng	It was an unexpected opportunity.
4902893	eng	Nobody expected anything from me.
4902894	eng	That wasn't something I expected.
4902896	eng	Expect to be pleasantly surprised.
4902897	eng	It wasn't something anybody expected.
4902910	eng	I wish I were different.
4903023	eng	Who are you calling stupid?
4903066	eng	He offered her his jacket.
4903070	eng	I was bad at English.
4903165	eng	Tom is finally himself again.
4903364	eng	Did anyone eat with you?
4903454	eng	The dancer dances a dance.
4903768	eng	I'm British born and bred.
4904101	eng	Can you outmaneuver your opponents?
4904141	eng	So thin! Are you dieting?
4904162	eng	The housing market is stagnant.
4904171	eng	Well, this is the street!
4904185	eng	It looks like that, huh?
4904188	eng	But we've seen it before.
4904319	eng	It happens frequently on vacation.
4904469	eng	Do you believe in ESP?
4904645	eng	We were all little once.
4904847	eng	I really can't explain why.
4904850	eng	Let me explain what happened.
4904851	eng	That's the only possible explanation.
4904852	eng	There are many possible explanations.
4904853	eng	There are several possible explanations.
4904854	eng	Perhaps that requires further explanation.
4904857	eng	This movie explores the possibilities.
4904858	eng	It's a common French expression.
4904859	eng	Words can't express our gratitude.
4904860	eng	I can't face the truth.
4904861	eng	The hostages are facing death.
4904862	eng	I'm not afraid to fail.
4904863	eng	We're going to have failures.
4904864	eng	Tom failed to understand that.
4904865	eng	I fear for Tom's safety.
4904866	eng	Tom's fears were well founded.
4904867	eng	Tom's fears weren't exactly unfounded.
4904868	eng	Children need to be fed.

4904888	eng	I was feeling OK then.
4904889	eng	It all felt so unreal.
4904890	eng	It feels good to help.
4904891	eng	It made me feel great.
4904892	eng	It made me feel lousy.
4904893	eng	It made me feel proud.

4904918	eng	Tom said he feels great.
4904919	eng	Tom said he felt strong.
4904920	eng	Can you feel the tension?
4904921	eng	Feel free to look around.
4904922	eng	I feel bad for everybody.
4904923	eng	I feel good about things.
4904924	eng	I feel horrible about it.
4904925	eng	I feel terrible about it.
4904926	eng	I felt dirty and ashamed.
4904927	eng	I felt kind of awestruck.
4904928	eng	I know that feeling, too.
4904929	eng	I know you feel grateful.
4904930	eng	I'll never feel that way.
4904931	eng	It was a strange feeling.

4904940	eng	That's my feeling as well.
4904941	eng	That's the feeling I have.
4904942	eng	I feel like I'm invincible.
4904943	eng	I really like that feeling.
4904944	eng	It was a wonderful feeling.
4904945	eng	It's a pretty good feeling.
4904946	eng	It's a really good feeling.
4904947	eng	I felt comfortable with Tom.
4904948	eng	I felt pretty good actually.
4904949	eng	I'm feeling much better now.
4904950	eng	I'm feeling pretty good now.
4904951	eng	Now you've hurt my feelings.
4904952	eng	That's how I feel sometimes.
4904953	eng	The water feels really warm.
4904954	eng	We feel this is appropriate.
4904956	eng	Tom felt something was wrong.
4904957	eng	I feel differently about this.
4904959	eng	I feel pretty comfortable here.
4904960	eng	I'll never forget that feeling.
4904961	eng	That was an incredible feeling.
4904962	eng	They felt good about themselves.
4904963	eng	They're all feeling pretty good.
4904964	eng	I fully understand your feelings.
4904966	eng	I'm feeling really confident now.
4904972	eng	What was the fight over?
4904973	eng	You look like a fighter.
4904974	eng	There's no need to fight.
4904975	eng	Tom helped fight the fire.
4904976	eng	Tom's a very good fighter.
4904977	eng	Tom got into another fight.
4904978	eng	You've got to keep fighting.
4904979	eng	We're fighting for our lives.
4904981	eng	The fight lasted three seconds.
4904982	eng	We've been fighting every night.
4904983	eng	They're fighting for their lives.
4904984	eng	They're always fighting among themselves.
4904985	eng	I can't figure it out.
4904986	eng	I just figured it out.
4904987	eng	Tom will figure it out.
4904988	eng	We've got it figured out.
4904989	eng	Tom can't figure it out.
4904990	eng	We got that figured out.
4904991	eng	We never figured out why.
4904992	eng	We figured it out quickly.
4904993	eng	They'll get it figured out.
4904994	eng	I'm still figuring stuff out.
4904996	eng	Tom has filed for divorce.
4904997	eng	This is the final straw.
4904998	eng	The wait is finally over.
4904999	eng	What was the final score?

4905004	eng	Tom is finally getting married.
4905005	eng	Plans haven't yet been finalized.
4905006	eng	I'm not a financial expert.
4905007	eng	Keep track of your finances.
4905008	eng	This is what I found.
4905009	eng	This is what we found.
4905010	eng	Tom isn't hard to find.
4905011	eng	Tom tried to find help.
4905012	eng	No suicide note was found.
4905013	eng	Did you find your passport?
4905014	eng	They'll never find you here.
4905015	eng	I find that very interesting.
4905018	eng	This is a significant finding.
4905019	eng	I find that pretty interesting.
4905020	eng	I found it extremely upsetting.
4905022	eng	I found Tom's comments interesting.
4905027	eng	Tom finished in last place.
4905028	eng	Tom finished in third place.
4905029	eng	Tom isn't quite finished yet.
4905030	eng	We finish each other's sentences.
4905031	eng	You haven't finished your coffee.
4905032	eng	We still have unfinished business.
4905033	eng	We're not finished with negotiations.
4905035	eng	Tom put out the fire.
4905036	eng	Not a shot was fired.
4905037	eng	Tom needs to be fired.
4905038	eng	Tom says he was fired.
4905039	eng	Tom was fired in 2013.
4905040	eng	Tom never fired a shot.
4905041	eng	Tom was fired last week.
4905042	eng	Tom was fired last October.
4905044	eng	The fire was quickly extinguished.
4907384	eng	We've got that figured out.
4907416	eng	Don't make me slap you.
4907686	eng	Do you like giving advice?
4907921	eng	Should I prepare the coffee?
4908041	eng	Ain't that just like me?
4908363	eng	Do you need an umbrella?
4908384	eng	That sounds fishy to me.
4908385	eng	We can't fish there anymore.
4908387	eng	Tom will fit in perfectly.
4908388	eng	It was easy to fix.
4908389	eng	We want to fix that.
4908390	eng	We've got to fix it.
4908391	eng	I'm trying to fix it.
4908392	eng	It needs to be fixed.
4908393	eng	I'm on a fixed income.
4908394	eng	Tom wants to fix that.
4908395	eng	Tom will get it fixed.
4908396	eng	Who can fix this mess?
4908397	eng	Tom wanted to fix that.
4908398	eng	You can't fix that now.
4908399	eng	I can't fix every problem.
4908400	eng	That's pretty easy to fix.
4908401	eng	Lots of things need fixing.
4908402	eng	This probably can be fixed.
4908403	eng	We fixed that pretty quickly.
4908408	eng	Tom looks kind of bored.
4908409	eng	I think this is inappropriate.
4908410	eng	Others were excluded too, right?
4908411	eng	Tom handed Mary the photographs.
4908414	eng	Everything Tom did was groundbreaking.
4908415	eng	We're obviously doing something right.
4908417	eng	Don't miss this incredible opportunity.
4908426	eng	It's difficult to find work.
4908558	eng	I was crazy about her.
4908560	eng	I was crazy about him.
4909855	eng	I am hungry right now.
4910127	eng	He isn't afraid of anything.
4910166	eng	My watch isn't working properly.
4910214	eng	Paul is smarter than Otto.
4910885	eng	Tom is disobedient and rebellious.
4910932	eng	Tom works for a startup.
4910940	eng	You did it on purpose!
4910954	eng	How did you know this?
4910961	eng	Did Tom ever answer you?
4912974	eng	Do you have some pencils?
4913137	eng	My name is not Tom.
4913138	eng	My name is not Tom!
4913159	eng	Love is in the air.
4913161	eng	Mary made her own lunch.
4913202	eng	And then everyone started laughing.
4913203	eng	And then everyone started singing.
4913204	eng	And then everyone started dancing.
4913268	eng	They're jealous of my noodles.
4913278	eng	Will you be my Valentine?
4913397	eng	My favorite pizza is Hawaiian.
4913623	eng	Your name affects your personality.
4913862	eng	Sorry, I don't feel well.
4913883	eng	Sit down, please, and listen.
4914978	eng	It rained in the forest.
4915350	eng	Finding a job is difficult.
4915372	eng	I saw them leave together.
4915644	eng	The natives are getting restless.
4915718	eng	What's your favorite spring flower?

4915720	eng	The following story is true.
4915721	eng	The following tips can help.
4915725	eng	Stop trying to fool us.
4915726	eng	I made a foolish mistake.
4915727	eng	We won't be fooled again.
4915728	eng	We won't get fooled again.
4915730	eng	I just forgot about it.
4915732	eng	Forget I ever said anything.
4915733	eng	Tom will never be forgotten.
4915734	eng	Forget what I said yesterday.
4915735	eng	That's pretty hard to forget.
4915737	eng	There's one thing we've forgotten.
4915738	eng	That's something I'll never forget.
4915741	eng	Tom will never be forgiven.
4915742	eng	Forgive me for my ignorance.
4915743	eng	The river is frozen over.
4915745	eng	It was a frightening experience.
4915749	eng	It gets a little frustrating.
4915750	eng	It's going to be frustrating.
4915751	eng	I'm the one that's frustrated.
4915753	eng	Tom said he's also frustrated.
4915754	eng	It's getting to be frustrating.
4915755	eng	Were you really that frustrated?
4915756	eng	I can understand Tom's frustration.
4915757	eng	I've been getting frustrated lately.
4915758	eng	Tom needs to gain weight.
4915759	eng	What have we really gained?
4915762	eng	I got a flu shot.
4915763	eng	I got on the plane.
4915765	eng	Tom got the day off.
4915767	eng	Get out of this room.
4915768	eng	I got a little tired.
4915769	eng	We have to get ready.

4915789	eng	That's the best we have.
4915790	eng	The room got very quiet.
4915792	eng	They've got a good team.

4915810	eng	The bath is getting cold.
4915811	eng	The police just got here.
4915812	eng	Tom got into a fistfight.

4918981	eng	It's going to be difficult.
4918982	eng	It's going to happen again.
4918983	eng	Things won't go as planned.

4931494	eng	How very wrong he was.
4931661	eng	You didn't say a word.
4931716	eng	Our boss approved our plan.
4931776	eng	I'm like drenched in sweat.
4931965	eng	Thank you for your recommendation.
4932076	eng	This expression is very Chinese.
4933060	eng	I want to visit Tom.
4933168	eng	Tom, you have a call!
4933870	eng	My opinion is the opposite.
4934300	eng	You cannot rely on politicians.

4935562	eng	Can you handle the truth?
4935563	eng	Tom handled it pretty well.
4935566	eng	Can Tom handle the pressure?
4935567	eng	You handled yourself well today.
4935568	eng	You obviously can't handle this.
4935569	eng	You handled that very skillfully.
4935571	eng	I hung up the phone.
4935572	eng	I miss hanging out there.
4935573	eng	We were just hanging out.
4935574	eng	I'm still hanging in there.
4935589	eng	I performed the work reluctantly.
4935635	eng	I liked this striped shirt.

4935939	eng	Mary is a social drinker.
4935984	eng	He unexpectedly called you stupid.
4935986	eng	I am waiting for approval.
4936184	eng	The snow bends the trees.
4936191	eng	Why are you always laughing?
4937814	eng	There's just absolutely nothing happening.
4937818	eng	What happened was a misunderstanding.
4937822	eng	Things aren't happening fast enough.
4937823	eng	That's exactly what's happening now.
4937824	eng	That's been happening every morning.
4937825	eng	Something very unusual has happened.
4937828	eng	Tom knows everything that happened.
4937830	eng	That happened on several occasions.
4937835	eng	Something similar happened to Tom.
4937837	eng	That's not exactly what happened.
4937838	eng	Remember what happened last year.
4937839	eng	Neither of those things happened.
4937840	eng	It's interesting how it happened.
4937841	eng	I'm telling you nothing happened.
4937842	eng	Hopefully, it won't happen again.
4937843	eng	What's happening here is absurd.
4937844	eng	What's happened in the meantime?
4937845	eng	What has actually happened here?
4937846	eng	We're scared it'll happen again.
4937847	eng	Tom's aware of what's happening.
4937848	eng	There's not much happening here.
4937850	eng	I think that's what's happening.
4937851	eng	Tom insisted it never happened.
4937852	eng	The same thing happened Monday.
4937853	eng	That's happening far too often.
4937854	eng	That never happened, of course.
4937855	eng	That all happened before lunch.
4937856	eng	None of that actually happened.
4937857	eng	It won't just happen overnight.
4937859	eng	You never know what'll happen.
4937860	eng	What happened can't be undone.
4937861	eng	We've seen that happen before.
4937862	eng	Tom wasn't sure what happened.
4937863	eng	That's why it hasn't happened.
4937864	eng	That's not what happened here.
4937866	eng	Many bad things have happened.
4937868	eng	An awful thing happened today.
4937869	eng	What's likely to happen next?
4937870	eng	What's happened to the money?

4937872	eng	What happened isn't a secret.
4937873	eng	What happened in the meeting?
4937874	eng	We're sorry that it happened.
4937875	eng	This must never happen again.
4937876	eng	That's happened to me before.
4937877	eng	That won't happen again soon.
4937878	eng	That happened just last week.
4937879	eng	It's not happening right now.
4937880	eng	It's funny how things happen.
4937881	eng	It happened again last night.
4937883	eng	I think that's what happened.
4937884	eng	You can't help what happens.
4937885	eng	Why is this happening again?
4937886	eng	What's likely to happen now?
4937887	eng	This is happening too often.
4937888	eng	Things like that can happen.
4937890	eng	That's what needs to happen.
4937891	eng	That won't happen this time.
4937892	eng	That won't happen on Monday.
4937893	eng	That might happen on Monday.
4937895	eng	Thanks for making it happen.
4937896	eng	It happened early last week.
4937897	eng	I'm sorry for what happened.
4937898	eng	I'm glad it's happening now.
4937899	eng	What happened to the money?
4937900	eng	We see that it's happening.
4937901	eng	We know what happened next.
4937902	eng	This sort of thing happens.
4937903	eng	This happened for a reason.
4937904	eng	Things happen for a reason.
4937905	eng	That's what happened to me.
4937906	eng	That keeps happening to me.
4937907	eng	So much has been happening.
4937908	eng	It won't happen right away.
4937909	eng	I've seen it happen before.
4937912	eng	Why is it still happening?
4937913	eng	We can make things happen.
4937914	eng	Tom is sure it'll happen.
4937915	eng	That may be what happened.
4937916	eng	That happens all the time.
4937917	eng	Now we know what happened.
4937918	eng	It's never happened to me.
4937919	eng	It may never happen again.
4937921	eng	It happened for a reason.
4937923	eng	Is that likely to happen?
4937926	eng	Let's see if it happens.
4937927	eng	It happens now and then.
4938477	eng	I didn't have to pay.
4938639	eng	Tom said you wouldn't go.
4939116	eng	Tom often thought about Mary.
4939117	eng	Maria named her dog Rex.
4939650	eng	She has a mysterious side.
4939774	eng	Doing that would be dangerous.
4939845	eng	I want to gain time.
4939848	eng	I wish to gain time.

4943599	eng	She has a purplish face.
4943630	eng	I'm rarely invited to parties.
4944022	eng	They missed the early train.
4945431	eng	Tom has high moral standards.
4945643	eng	Let's discuss this over lunch.
4945647	eng	Let's not discuss this now.
4945660	eng	The house was very dusty.
4945666	eng	She lounged by the pool.
4945669	eng	This painting is a forgery.
4947729	eng	Tom is a bell maker.
4948414	eng	Why did Dan kill himself?
4948472	eng	I'll find the money somehow.
4948477	eng	What goes well with potatoes?
4948502	eng	I like the fresh air.
4948510	eng	The change was nine pesos.
4948512	eng	I have a hundred pesos.
4948518	eng	How much is my fare?
4949522	eng	I read my horoscope today.
4949561	eng	Tom loves his daughter's face.
4949588	eng	It's all I could find.
4949598	eng	Don't bite my head off.
4949627	eng	You'll be fine with me.
4949628	eng	We'll sort it out later.
4949632	eng	Are you desperate for company?
4949706	eng	I'm theoretically home next weekend.
4949715	eng	I've done a little hunting.
4949939	eng	Tom has put on weight.
4949940	eng	What's the harm in that?
4949941	eng	The meeting lasted one hour.
4949942	eng	I know you hate it.
4949943	eng	Some of us hate it.
4949944	eng	No wonder Tom hates us.
4949945	eng	I hate everything about it.
4949946	eng	People need to stop hating.

4980184	eng	I was curious about that.
4980186	eng	I was happy to leave.
4980187	eng	I was happy with that.
4980188	eng	I was here in 2013.
4980189	eng	I was just really lucky.
4980190	eng	I was kind of nervous.
4980191	eng	I was only thirteen then.
4980192	eng	I was open and honest.
4980193	eng	I was proud of myself.
4980194	eng	I was surprised about it.
4980195	eng	I was sworn to secrecy.
4980196	eng	I was there once before.
4980197	eng	I was there three days.
4980198	eng	I was very, very happy.
4980199	eng	I was working that night.
4980202	eng	I wonder what Tom thinks.
4980204	eng	I wondered where Tom was.
4980205	eng	I'll be away till Christmas.
4980206	eng	I'll be meeting with Tom.
4980207	eng	I'll be there till 2:30.
4980212	eng	I'll take whatever I can.
4980213	eng	I'm a little bit nervous.
4980214	eng	I'm a real simple person.
4980215	eng	I'm grateful to be alive.
4980216	eng	I'm happy that it's over.
4980218	eng	I'm not exactly sure why.
4980219	eng	I'm not happy about that.
4980221	eng	I'm pretty happy with it.
4980222	eng	I'm pretty proud of that.
4980223	eng	I'm really proud of that.
4980520	eng	Pass me the sugar, please.
4980521	eng	I was feeling the same.
4980732	eng	Unfriendliness is the new thinking.
4980743	eng	Your English doesn't sound ugly.
4980931	eng	I'm only pulling your leg.
4980978	eng	I'm scared of Tom's dog.
4980979	eng	I'm still upset about it.
4980980	eng	I'm toying with the idea.
4980981	eng	I'm very glad about that.
4980982	eng	I'm very grateful for that.
4980983	eng	I'm very mindful of that.
4980984	eng	I'm very pleased with it.
4980985	eng	I'm very proud of myself.
4980986	eng	I've been here twice now.
4981303	eng	Where did the tragedy occur?
4981312	eng	I reddened like a tomato.
4981345	eng	He was a formidable opponent.
4981393	eng	You deserve to be congratulated.
4981496	eng	That was a formidable opponent.
4982257	eng	I am resistant to cold.
4982435	eng	Tom has the right attitude.
4982821	eng	Who's Tatoeba? Your new girlfriend?
4983072	eng	It's like tilting at windmills.
4983550	eng	You've been spying on me.
4983551	eng	You really made me proud.
4983552	eng	Tom thought I was lying.
4983555	eng	Tom certainly has a temper.
4983556	eng	Tom always made me laugh.
4983558	eng	They were laughing at me.
4983559	eng	They wanted to punish me.
4983560	eng	The odds were against me.
4983561	eng	The odds are against me.
4983562	eng	That's what I'm proud of.
4983563	eng	That's my job, not Tom's.
4983564	eng	That's all I worry about.
4983567	eng	Some of my friends smoke.
4983568	eng	Please wait until I'm ready.
4983569	eng	Please wait a while longer.
4983570	eng	Please tell me I'm right.
4983571	eng	Nobody would talk to me.
4983572	eng	My mother never liked me.
4983573	eng	Music is important to me.
4983574	eng	It sounds simple, I know.
4983576	eng	I've seen enough for now.
4983578	eng	I've had so much support.
4983579	eng	I've already written to Tom.
4983581	eng	I'm not really that sorry.
4983582	eng	I'm not like anybody else.
4983583	eng	I'm named after my father.
4983584	eng	I'm here to play baseball.
4983585	eng	I'm disgusted by all this.
4983587	eng	I'll pray for your family.
4983590	eng	I wasn't worried about it.
4983591	eng	I wasn't raised like that.
4983592	eng	I wasn't nervous about it.
4983593	eng	I wasn't interested in it.
4983594	eng	I wasn't confident at all.
4983596	eng	I thought you were married.
4983598	eng	I thought Tom was awesome.
4983599	eng	I thought it was terrible.
4983600	eng	I thought it was shocking.
4983601	eng	I thought it was possible.
4983602	eng	I thought it was pathetic.
4983603	eng	I thought about my family.
4983607	eng	I think I understand you.
4983608	eng	I talked to Tom yesterday.
4983609	eng	I take vitamins every day.
4983611	eng	I still love classic rock.
4983612	eng	I really needed Tom there.
4983613	eng	I really love working out.
4983614	eng	I really like your music.
4983615	eng	I might not sleep tonight.
4983616	eng	I love watching you work.
4983617	eng	I love watching you dance.
4983619	eng	I know it sounds familiar.
4983621	eng	I have to plan everything.
4983622	eng	I have a serious question.
4983625	eng	I can't wait until Monday.
4983626	eng	I can't wait for tomorrow.
4983627	eng	I can't resist any longer.
4983628	eng	I can't even imagine that.
4983629	eng	I always think about that.
4983630	eng	I always liked Tom better.
4983631	eng	I actually really like it.
4983632	eng	Have I taught you nothing?
4983799	eng	I always think about it.
4984206	eng	The battle lasted a week.
4984292	eng	What was I worrying about?
4984293	eng	Were you talking about me?
4984294	eng	We've been lucky, I think.
4984295	eng	Tom was sitting behind me.
4984296	eng	Tom isn't a baby anymore.
4984299	eng	This is my third marriage.
4984301	eng	These are my best friends.
4984302	eng	That's not really my job.
4984304	eng	That seems inhumane to me.
4984305	eng	Thanks for having me here.
4984306	eng	Nobody knows me in Boston.
4984307	eng	My car wasn't good enough.
4984308	eng	It wasn't important to me.
4984562	eng	Drink a tea with me!
4984563	eng	Have some tea with me!
4984708	eng	I've been praying for you.
4984709	eng	I'm working on my project.
4984710	eng	I'm very sorry about this.
4984711	eng	I'm very happy about that.
4984712	eng	I'm trying to be cautious.
4984713	eng	I'm tired of your whining.
4984716	eng	I'm sure Tom owns property.
4984718	eng	I'm still looking into it.
4984721	eng	I'm sick of the hypocrisy.
4984722	eng	I'm really upset about it.
4984724	eng	I'm really happy I'm here.
4984725	eng	I'm really happy about it.
4984726	eng	I'm quite shocked by this.
4985102	eng	What did you both do?
4985129	eng	Don't go in that room.
4985274	eng	I'm not worried that much.
4985276	eng	I'm not too upset anymore.
4985277	eng	I'm not thinking about it.
4985278	eng	I'm not surprised one bit.
4985281	eng	I won't tell anybody else.
4985283	eng	I thought I'd been stabbed.
4985284	eng	I thought I performed well.
4985288	eng	I think Tom likes baseball.
4985890	eng	We are buying movie tickets.
4986049	eng	I can see you're speechless.
4986074	eng	Don't let on I'm here.
4986103	eng	She waited for the bus.
4986137	eng	Do you talk about us?
4986231	eng	That is not an island.
4986443	eng	We won't let you die.
4986570	eng	The house is suitably isolated.
4986611	eng	Is it pleasing to you?
4987278	eng	I think Tom is progressing.
4987280	eng	I think that's a possibility.
4987282	eng	I think it's a possibility.
4987283	eng	I think it was intentional.
4987284	eng	I think I missed something.
4987285	eng	I think everybody is ready.
4987286	eng	I think about Tom sometimes.
4987287	eng	I think about it sometimes.
4987288	eng	I suppose that makes sense.
4987289	eng	I respect people like that.
4987290	eng	I really like my teammates.
4987292	eng	I probably won't watch this.
4987294	eng	I passed every single test.
4987295	eng	I passed all my tests.
4987581	eng	I am not a pillow.
4987960	eng	JavaScript is a programming language.
4987970	eng	The company is in debt.
4988134	eng	I'm fed up with him!
4988157	eng	The world's resources are limited.
4988356	eng	Would you like a little?
4988390	eng	Pigeons and hens are birds.
4988409	eng	I have never seen him.
4988428	eng	She's very busy on Friday.
4988501	eng	But there are other advantages.
4988516	eng	The creation killed its creator.
4988517	eng	They stopped three minutes later.
4989120	eng	Don't come to the meeting!
4989166	eng	You know what you know!
4989378	eng	The truth doesn't always win.
4990299	eng	It's ten past four now.
4990691	eng	Kitty, you are my ditty.
4990703	eng	I don't live in Helsinki.
4991225	eng	I say I'm not guilty.
4991253	eng	Tom died in his prime.
4991299	eng	They can be understood, too.
4991303	eng	The party was awfully boring.
4991324	eng	He must have already come.
4991744	eng	That's junk. Throw it away.
4991918	eng	Stop it. You're embarrassing me.
4992760	eng	Does the meat look under-cooked?
4994801	eng	The drain is clogged again.
4995334	eng	I always forget people's names.
4996859	eng	I'm in a pretty pickle.
4997287	eng	Does he speak Hungarian too?
4997289	eng	Does she speak Hungarian too?
4998369	eng	You'll probably see me again.
4998372	eng	Why's everyone looking at me?
4998373	eng	What I think isn't important.
4998375	eng	Tom thought I was serious.
4998376	eng	Tom read my mind perfectly.
4998377	eng	Tom probably saved my life.
4998379	eng	Tom is someone I trust.
4998924	eng	Who's chairing the meeting today?
4999042	eng	That's what really scares me.
4999043	eng	That's what I'm focused on.
4999044	eng	That's very important to me.
4999045	eng	That's the problem, I think.
4999046	eng	That's one of my weaknesses.
4999047	eng	That's not really my thing.
4999048	eng	That's all I'm looking for.
4999049	eng	That was something I wanted.
4999050	eng	That was my initial thought.
4999051	eng	That was my biggest problem.
4999052	eng	That was interesting to me.
4999053	eng	That seems reasonable to me.
4999054	eng	That almost made me laugh.
4999055	eng	Tell me about your children.
4999056	eng	Someone parked in my spot.
4999059	eng	People treat me with respect.
4999170	eng	I must've eaten something bad.
4999306	eng	Some didn't want to discuss.
4999322	eng	Sorry, I can't do that.
4999689	eng	I'm neither optimistic nor pessimistic.
4999690	eng	I support your comments wholeheartedly.
4999693	eng	I have three beautiful granddaughters.
4999695	eng	I'm afraid you've misunderstood this.
4999702	eng	Everyone knows I'm Tom's girlfriend.
4999706	eng	I think that's absolutely fabulous.
4999707	eng	I think it's absolutely ridiculous.
4999708	eng	I've missed so many opportunities.
4999712	eng	This makes me very uncomfortable.
4999713	eng	Sometimes I even surprise myself.
4999714	eng	Maybe I'm missing something here.
4999715	eng	It's something I've always liked.
4999717	eng	I'm pleasantly surprised by that.
4999719	eng	I'll always remember your advice.
4999721	eng	That's what really impressed me.
4999723	eng	I've tried to stop multitasking.
4999724	eng	I've never regretted doing that.
4999725	eng	I've never really been anywhere.
4999726	eng	I've never played soccer before.
4999728	eng	I've always wondered about this.
4999729	eng	I've always liked horror movies.
4999730	eng	I've already thought about that.
4999731	eng	I'm surprised by Tom's response.
4999732	eng	I'm pretty good at multitasking.
4999737	eng	I thought it wasn't appropriate.
4999738	eng	I think that's really important.
4999739	eng	I think that's pretty fantastic.
4999741	eng	I have several Canadian friends.
4999745	eng	Well, I think it's interesting.
4999747	eng	That seems irresponsible to me.
4999748	eng	It's part of my responsibility.
4999749	eng	I've never noticed that before.
4999750	eng	I've met some wonderful people.
4999751	eng	I've been everywhere in Europe.
4999752	eng	I've always liked those people.
4999753	eng	I'm very optimistic about this.
4999754	eng	I'm sure it wasn't intentional.
4999755	eng	I'm sure I'm missing something.
4999756	eng	I'm probably spending more now.
4999757	eng	I'm not saying anybody's lying.
4999758	eng	I'm not exaggerating, you know.
4999759	eng	I'm looking towards the future.
4999760	eng	I'm from around here, actually.
4999761	eng	I'm definitely a little better.
4999762	eng	I wonder what they're planning.
4999763	eng	I watch very little television.
4999764	eng	I took responsibility for that.
4999765	eng	I thought that was interesting.
4999766	eng	I thought it was inappropriate.
4999767	eng	I thought it looked ridiculous.
4999768	eng	I think that shocked everybody.
4999769	eng	I regret this decision already.
4999771	eng	I definitely think it's doable.
4999772	eng	I can understand your position.
4999773	eng	Obviously, I was very shocked.
4999774	eng	I've already had many chances.
4999775	eng	I was just playing basketball.
4999777	eng	I thought that was remarkable.
4999778	eng	I think that's probably right.
4999779	eng	I think that's pretty obvious.
4999780	eng	I think about that constantly.
4999781	eng	I like Tom's aggressive style.
4999782	eng	Actually, that's why I'm here.
4999783	eng	I'm reasonably certain of it.
4999798	eng	I'm not sure that's suitable.
4999799	eng	I'm not looking for anything.
4999800	eng	I'm like everybody else here.
4999801	eng	I'm familiar with Tom's work.
4999802	eng	I'm actually a little afraid.
4999803	eng	I'll never leave early again.
4999804	eng	I'll definitely look into it.
4999807	eng	I thought that was thrilling.
4999808	eng	I thought that was fantastic.
4999809	eng	I thought everybody liked it.
4999810	eng	I think that's pretty stupid.
4999811	eng	I think it's absolutely fine.
4999812	eng	I really want another chance.
4999814	eng	I know that's real important.
4999815	eng	I know it's pretty important.
4999816	eng	I just wanted an opportunity.
4999817	eng	I just can't understand this.
4999818	eng	I have three college degrees.
4999819	eng	I have absolutely no regrets.
4999820	eng	Have dinner with me tomorrow.
4999821	eng	Hardly anyone knows I'm here.
4999822	eng	Everybody is looking for Tom.
4999823	eng	Both my sisters are teachers.
4999824	eng	Nothing else mattered to me.
4999825	eng	My family has suffered, too.
4999826	eng	It's me they're waiting for.
4999827	eng	It's exactly what I thought.
4999828	eng	I've never said that before.
4999829	eng	I've never had that problem.
4999830	eng	I've been really happy here.
4999832	eng	I'm really angry about this.
4999833	eng	I'm real impressed with Tom.
4999834	eng	I'm quite worried about Tom.
4999836	eng	I'm pretty interested in it.
4999837	eng	I'm not the least surprised.
4999838	eng	I'm not saying that's wrong.
4999839	eng	I'm deeply offended by this.
4999840	eng	I'm confident in my ability.
4999841	eng	I'm being patient right now.
4999842	eng	I thought it was refreshing.
4999843	eng	I thought it was incredible.
4999844	eng	I think they're working now.
4999845	eng	I think they were surprised.
4999846	eng	I think they knew something.
4999847	eng	I think that's pretty funny.
4999848	eng	I think it's very important.
4999849	eng	I think it's very difficult.
4999850	eng	I know that it's inevitable.
4999851	eng	I haven't worked since then.
4999852	eng	I have a serious girlfriend.
4999853	eng	Everything looks good to me.
4999854	eng	Everything looks fine to me.
4999855	eng	Everybody was looking at me.
4999856	eng	My mom was a schoolteacher.
4999857	eng	Maybe I'm working too much.
4999858	eng	I've been very, very lucky.
4999859	eng	I'm well ahead of schedule.
4999860	eng	I'm very thankful for that.
4999861	eng	I'm very positive about it.
4999864	eng	I'm really happy with that.
4999865	eng	I'm pretty sure that's Tom.
4999866	eng	I'm perfectly fine with it.
4999867	eng	I'm perfectly OK with that.
4999868	eng	I'm not motivated by money.
4999869	eng	I'm not impressed with Tom.
4999870	eng	I'm friends with the owner.
4999871	eng	I'll probably use it again.
4999872	eng	I'll definitely look at it.
4999873	eng	I'd never seen that before.
4999874	eng	I won't mention that again.
4999875	eng	I wasn't really having fun.
4999877	eng	I tried to resuscitate Tom.
4999878	eng	I thought it worked nicely.
4999879	eng	I thought it was marvelous.
4999880	eng	I thought it was heartburn.
4999882	eng	I now understand it better.
4999883	eng	I never really was nervous.
4999884	eng	I never even mentioned Tom.
4999885	eng	I made a horrible decision.
4999886	eng	I left everything in there.
4999887	eng	I just can't understand it.
4999888	eng	I haven't thought about it.
4999889	eng	I haven't spoken to anyone.
4999890	eng	I actually really liked it.
4999894	eng	I'm a pretty stubborn guy.
4999896	eng	I thought Tom was serious.
4999897	eng	I think Tom was surprised.
4999910	eng	I think Tom looked happy.
4999911	eng	I think Tom is satisfied.
4999924	eng	I thought that was fun.
4999928	eng	How heavy is too heavy?
4999929	eng	That isn't a new idea.
4999936	eng	No one will stop you.
4999948	eng	How cold is too cold?
4999949	eng	We have a good team.
4999950	eng	No one will stop us.
4999951	eng	It might be a shark.
4999958	eng	We had so much fun.
4999959	eng	Tom was a nice kid.
4999960	eng	Tom was a good kid.

5021776	eng	That was all Tom needed.
5021777	eng	That was never an issue.
5021778	eng	That was quite a moment.
5021779	eng	That was the last straw.

5066376	eng	Are things any better now?
5066377	eng	Are you good with numbers?
5066378	eng	Are you really that naive?
5066379	eng	At least it wasn't boring.
5066380	eng	At least that part's true.

5066391	eng	Isn't it better like this?
5066392	eng	Isn't that a little harsh?
5066393	eng	Isn't that what they want?
5066394	eng	It probably won't be easy.
5066833	eng	I'm sorry I misspelled it.
5066843	eng	Everything was only a joke.
5067374	eng	I wanted to save you.

5067532	eng	Be as specific as possible.
5067533	eng	The audience was very quiet.
5067597	eng	I cannot bear this pain.
5067637	eng	The day brings many things.
5067902	eng	Perseverance conquers the worst obstacles.
5067973	eng	I'm not at work today.
5067984	eng	We shouldn't overdramatise this drama.
5067993	eng	The Swiss are not Swedes.
5067996	eng	Cuba is not a cube.

5068208	eng	The exact opposite is true.
5068209	eng	Here's an even better idea.
5068210	eng	How does this work exactly?
5068211	eng	How many people work there?
5068254	eng	Tom swam in his clothes.
5068268	eng	He took the wrong bus.
5068282	eng	How long did that take?
5068284	eng	He hurt his hand falling.
5068371	eng	Is that your new boyfriend?
5068372	eng	Is that only a coincidence?
5068373	eng	Is that just a coincidence?
5068380	eng	How was that decision made?
5068624	eng	That dog's name is Ken.
5068653	eng	Is that your new friend?
5068660	eng	Is that your new girlfriend?
5068697	eng	Everybody seems to like him.
5068702	eng	Everybody seems to like her.
5068703	eng	Everybody seems to like them.
5069027	eng	Are you planning on voting?
5069028	eng	Can this problem be solved?
5069033	eng	Isn't that against the law?
5069034	eng	Isn't that worth some risk?
5069035	eng	Isn't this kind of obvious?
5069037	eng	It rained the whole night.
5069038	eng	It really isn't that simple.
5069041	eng	It was a great opportunity.
5069042	eng	It was a great performance.

5069140	eng	Tom sat on the rug.
5069141	eng	Tom sat on the carpet.
5069142	eng	Tom sat on the floor.
5069430	eng	It's doable, but not easy.
5069431	eng	It's been kind of chaotic.
5069432	eng	It's already much too late.
5069433	eng	It's actually a good idea.
5069434	eng	It's a waste of resources.

5069436	eng	It's a very special place.
5069437	eng	It's a very serious matter.

5069447	eng	It wasn't a secret meeting.
5069448	eng	It wasn't a hard decision.
5069449	eng	It was quite an experience.
5069459	eng	Loving is half of believing.
5069674	eng	You are the guilty party.
5069677	eng	Give me just a minute.
5069682	eng	Right now I'm not thirsty.
5069698	eng	But something different came out.
5069699	eng	God listened to my prayers.
5069703	eng	It's just not good enough.
5069704	eng	It's made a big difference.

5085921	eng	I'll probably vote for Tom.
5085925	eng	Isn't that a little strange?
5085926	eng	It hardly made a difference.
5085928	eng	It was a decent performance.
5085929	eng	It was a short conversation.
5085930	eng	It was a wonderful surprise.
5085931	eng	It was inevitable, wasn't it?
5085932	eng	It was wonderful, wasn't it?
5085933	eng	It wasn't a good experience.

5085944	eng	It's a very strange process.
5085945	eng	It's always been quiet here.
5085946	eng	It's definitely a good sign.
5085947	eng	It's exactly what they want.
5085948	eng	It's exactly what we needed.
5085949	eng	It's hard to stay objective.
5085950	eng	It's new and very different.
5085952	eng	It's not an unfair proposal.
5086053	eng	Tom is a great attorney.

5086286	eng	He spoke about you yesterday.
5087182	eng	It's not hard to understand.
5087183	eng	It's only taken three years.
5087185	eng	It's pretty easy to imagine.
5087187	eng	It's sure to be interesting.
5087188	eng	It's very important to vote.
5087189	eng	It's very strange and weird.

5087306	eng	With whom did she speak?
5087319	eng	Since when is Richard married?
5087320	eng	When did Richard get married?
5087328	eng	With whom are you speaking?
5087349	eng	I can't stand children crying.
5087356	eng	The show has been cancelled.
5087361	eng	What you think is irrelevant.
5087366	eng	All her photos have watermarks.
5087398	eng	Let's talk about the future.
5087400	eng	Let's work together on this.
5087401	eng	Look, what's this all about?

5088071	eng	Tom's lights are still on.
5088073	eng	This is definitely not new.
5088074	eng	This is just too expensive.
5088075	eng	Tom was a terrible husband.
5088076	eng	Well, what's wrong with it?
5088077	eng	What else can you remember?
5088078	eng	What exactly are the rules?
5088079	eng	What exactly is the threat?
5088080	eng	What exactly is this about?
5088081	eng	What exactly is your point?
5088082	eng	What were they waiting for?
5088083	eng	What's Tom supposed to say?
5088084	eng	What's the door locked for?
5088085	eng	What's the reason for that?
5088086	eng	What's the use of worrying?
5088087	eng	What's there to comment on?
5088088	eng	What's wrong with you, Tom?
5088089	eng	What's your opinion of Tom?
5088285	eng	I did nazi that coming.
5088437	eng	Who else was staying there?
5088438	eng	Why hasn't Tom been jailed?
5088439	eng	You might actually like it.
5088440	eng	You guys were really good.
5088441	eng	Now you're just being silly.
5088442	eng	OK, that's enough for today.
5088443	eng	One person is still missing.
5088444	eng	People here are really nice.
5088445	eng	People think that it's easy.
5088446	eng	Please read the whole story.
5088447	eng	Please send us more details.
5088448	eng	Right now, things are tense.
5088449	eng	Someone will be meeting you.
5088451	eng	That isn't really the point.
5088452	eng	That made a huge difference.
5088453	eng	That was a fun conversation.
5088454	eng	That's a really old picture.
5088455	eng	That's actually a good idea.
5088456	eng	That's all that matters now.
5088458	eng	That's not the entire story.
5088459	eng	That's not the problem here.
5088460	eng	That's not the real problem.
5088461	eng	That's not what we're about.
5088462	eng	That's what they always say.
5088463	eng	What's wrong with this plan?
5088464	eng	Right now, people are scared.
5088465	eng	Sometimes Tom tries too hard.
5088466	eng	The people are friendly here.
5088471	eng	That's highly unlikely to happen.
5089258	eng	I've heard of worse things.
5089891	eng	I don't eat any bread.
5089985	eng	I wasn't ready for that.
5089988	eng	I know where everyone is.
5089989	eng	Tom took out his camera.
5089991	eng	We want everybody to vote.
5089992	eng	We'll need more than that.
5089993	eng	We're still short on cash.
5089994	eng	We're working on that now.
5089995	eng	Tom already knew the truth.
5089996	eng	Tom must be really worried.
5089997	eng	Tom must really be worried.
5089998	eng	Tom said he wasn't injured.
5089999	eng	The bathroom window is open.
5090000	eng	The beaches are better here.
5090001	eng	The police are here already.
5090002	eng	The weather is just perfect.
5090003	eng	The whole group is laughing.
5090004	eng	The whole house was shaking.
5090005	eng	There was plenty of traffic.
5090006	eng	There were no real problems.
5090007	eng	There will be no exceptions.
5090008	eng	They treated us like family.
5090009	eng	They're all waiting for you.
5090010	eng	They're quicker than we are.
5090011	eng	This is a common occurrence.
5090012	eng	This is a difficult mission.
5090013	eng	This is a real breakthrough.
5090014	eng	This is a serious situation.
5090015	eng	This is better than nothing.
5090016	eng	This is entirely your fault.
5090017	eng	This is no mere coincidence.
5090018	eng	This is very difficult work.
5090019	eng	This isn't a trivial matter.
5090020	eng	This last week's been crazy.
5090021	eng	This time will be different.

5090036	eng	Tom provided what we needed.
5090037	eng	Tom said that wasn't enough.
5090038	eng	Tom says it's a possibility.
5090039	eng	Tom seems to be progressing.
5090040	eng	Tom simply can't be trusted.

5090043	eng	Tom took everything from us.
5090044	eng	Tom wants to study medicine.

5090063	eng	Tom's attitude is pretty good.
5090071	eng	Tom's surgery lasted three hours.
5090379	eng	A week later, she died.
5090383	eng	She showed her my photograph.
5090385	eng	No, I won't say anything.
5090391	eng	You must expose the impostors.
5090701	eng	We need to start planning.
5090702	eng	I haven't read the report.
5090703	eng	It certainly has been fun.
5090704	eng	Tom's wife's name is Mary.
5090707	eng	We'll never know the truth.
5090708	eng	When were you in Australia?
5090710	eng	Try to have some compassion.
5090711	eng	Valuable time has been lost.
5090712	eng	We had a great conversation.
5090713	eng	We had a great relationship.
5090714	eng	We have a good relationship.
5090715	eng	We have great teachers here.
5090716	eng	We haven't reached our goal.
5090717	eng	We just weren't good enough.
5090718	eng	We made some poor decisions.
5090719	eng	We only have one television.
5090720	eng	We play chess every evening.
5090721	eng	We take that very seriously.
5090722	eng	We talked about food prices.
5090723	eng	We talked to them yesterday.
5090724	eng	We think it's pretty simple.
5090725	eng	We thought it was fantastic.
5090726	eng	We treat our customers well.
5090727	eng	We weren't surprised at all.
5090728	eng	We weren't worried about it.
5091283	eng	"Thank you." "No, thank you."
5091615	eng	That can only be her.
5091759	eng	Is he friendly to you?
5091820	eng	I don't pet your dogs.
5092253	eng	Welcome back. We missed you.
5092305	eng	Isn't this what you wanted?
5092306	eng	Tom has pleaded not guilty.
5092307	eng	Tom still looks very tired.
5092308	eng	We're not used to visitors.
5092309	eng	We've been here for months.
5092310	eng	Haven't we done this before?
5092311	eng	It's not my problem anymore.
5092318	eng	Tom always keeps me waiting.
5092319	eng	We need an itemized receipt.
5092912	eng	He thought you knew Tom.
5092913	eng	She thought you knew Tom.
5093282	eng	The Gallic troops were exhausted.
5093285	eng	The Roman troops were exhausted.
5093310	eng	The Romans began the battle.
5093316	eng	Tom is a timid boy.
5093334	eng	Tom's father is called John.
5093345	eng	They are faster than us.
5093359	eng	I'm not lowering your salaries.
5093588	eng	Tom thought Mary knew John.
5093619	eng	We're all smarter than that.
5093620	eng	We're fortunate to have Tom.
5093621	eng	We're no different than Tom.
5093622	eng	We're not scared of anybody.
5093623	eng	We're not totally ready yet.
5093624	eng	We're very confident in Tom.
5093625	eng	We're very serious about it.
5093626	eng	We've all been working hard.
5093627	eng	We've been waiting for that.
5093628	eng	We've been waiting for this.
5093629	eng	Well, that's not quite true.
5093630	eng	Well, what's the matter now?
5093631	eng	What are they interested in?
5093632	eng	What can't you live without?
5093633	eng	What makes you so confident?
5093725	eng	Thanks for the pretty postcard.
5094191	eng	He will be reading everything.
5094384	eng	He is the devil incarnate.
5094798	eng	What time are they starting?
5094799	eng	What trips are you planning?
5094800	eng	What was that meeting about?
5094801	eng	What were the meetings like?
5094802	eng	What were your parents like?
5094803	eng	What's so special about Tom?
5094804	eng	What's the idea behind that?
5094805	eng	What's the weather like now?
5094806	eng	What's your opinion on that?
5094807	eng	Where are those people from?
5094808	eng	Where are those posters now?
5094809	eng	Who can tell the difference?
5094810	eng	Will this year be different?
5094811	eng	You have to have confidence.
5094812	eng	You have to start somewhere.
5094813	eng	You sound like a politician.
5094814	eng	You'll never know the truth.
5094815	eng	You'll never see that again.
5094816	eng	You're your own worst enemy.
5094902	eng	Thanks for learning our language.
5094944	eng	With these we will fight.
5094953	eng	You have heard, seen, suffered.
5094968	eng	An army was being gathered.
5094970	eng	He kept finding many pretexts.
5095019	eng	He paid the army wages.
5095070	eng	Would that Orestes were near.
5095076	eng	Cyrus ought to be alive.
5095077	eng	Ah! that Cyrus were living!
5095083	eng	What will happen to me?
5095105	eng	My children, let us rise.
5095109	eng	Let me go to her!
5095115	eng	Let me not be wronged.
5095117	eng	Leave me not thus alone.
5095213	eng	How should I find death?
5095215	eng	Where might the strangers be?
5095221	eng	But take her within, slaves.
5095235	eng	No one shall ever say.
5095242	eng	No serious news, I hope?
5095259	eng	I will never follow thee.
5095266	eng	There's need of a fight.
5095297	eng	Thou remindest me of sorrows.
5095310	eng	Toil to toil brings toil.
5095383	eng	Things will come of themselves.
5095395	eng	He had nothing to tell.
5095414	eng	I am about to suffer.
5095572	eng	The Germans began the battle.
5095968	eng	The wayward son has returned.
5095985	eng	Why do you have diarrhea?
5096024	eng	"Are you coming?" "Of course."
5096201	eng	I never ceased pitying ourselves.
5096224	eng	A light breakfast was served.
5096225	eng	A little competition is good.
5096226	eng	Can stress actually kill you?
5096227	eng	Can't this problem be solved?
5096228	eng	Everybody has worked so hard.
5096229	eng	Everybody knows what Tom did.
5096230	eng	Everybody still has a chance.
5096231	eng	Everything is still the same.
5096232	eng	Everything was taken from us.
5096233	eng	Everything will be just fine.
5096234	eng	Everything you want is there.
5096235	eng	How many people are involved?
5096236	eng	Is competition good for kids?
5096237	eng	Is that not possible anymore?
5096238	eng	Is there reason for optimism?
5096239	eng	Is there some other solution?
5096240	eng	Isn't that a little juvenile?
5096241	eng	Isn't that against the rules?
5096242	eng	Isn't there anything in here?
5096243	eng	Isn't this against the rules?
5096244	eng	It was a learning experience.
5096245	eng	It was a little disorienting.
5096246	eng	It was a positive experience.
5096247	eng	It was an extraordinary year.
5096248	eng	It was an unfortunate choice.
5096249	eng	It won't necessarily be easy.
5096250	eng	It'll be an interesting game.
5096251	eng	It'll be different, for sure.
5096252	eng	It's a very complex question.
5096253	eng	It's all that really matters.
5096254	eng	It's hard being a politician.
5096255	eng	It's just basic common sense.
5096256	eng	It's more than a coincidence.
5096307	eng	He broke down every one.
5096338	eng	I teach Spanish very well.
5096339	eng	We teach Spanish very well.
5096380	eng	I think Esperanto is difficult.
5096446	eng	Tom's dog can swim well.
5096506	eng	That is bad for you.
5096508	eng	You'll be expelled from school.
5096534	eng	Frogs are such marvelous creatures.
5096541	eng	I think French is difficult.
5096555	eng	Everything flows and nothing remains.
5096574	eng	That's what we've always wanted.
5096576	eng	Tom is Mary's former boyfriend.
5096579	eng	Tom always worries about money.
5096586	eng	Tom is John's younger brother.
5096587	eng	Tom and Mary studied together.
5096588	eng	This isn't really Tom's fault.
5096589	eng	That's what we're waiting for.
5096590	eng	So what is everyone's problem?
5096591	eng	Please don't open this window.
5096592	eng	Oh, it's quite simple, really.
5096593	eng	It's unlikely Tom will return.
5096594	eng	Can anyone really replace Tom?
5096595	eng	Why is everyone so surprised?
5096598	eng	What's the problem with that?
5096599	eng	What makes a good journalist?
5096600	eng	Well, what's wrong with that?
5096601	eng	We're very satisfied with it.
5096602	eng	We're better off without Tom.
5096603	eng	We must respect their wishes.
5096604	eng	Tom's family is in Australia.
5096605	eng	Tom's body has been cremated.

5096613	eng	Tom has three adult children.
5096614	eng	This may not be coincidental.
5096615	eng	This is the hardest question.
5096616	eng	This is an indisputable fact.
5096617	eng	This is an incredible result.
5096618	eng	This is an important victory.
5096619	eng	They're a good baseball team.
5096620	eng	They really loved each other.
5096621	eng	There's not a big difference.
5096622	eng	There's just not enough time.
5096623	eng	There's a lot of competition.
5096624	eng	There won't be anything left.
5096625	eng	There won't be any surprises.
5096626	eng	There were plenty of choices.
5096627	eng	There were no prior warnings.
5096628	eng	There were no other injuries.
5096629	eng	There were no more questions.
5096630	eng	There was no point remaining.
5096631	eng	There was no plan whatsoever.
5096632	eng	There has been progress made.
5096633	eng	The situation there is tense.
5096634	eng	The situation is still tense.
5096635	eng	The reason is pretty obvious.
5096636	eng	We know where he is.
5096640	eng	My house needs considerable repairs.
5096651	eng	We cannot do those things.
5096683	eng	The farmers are planting rice.
5096684	eng	The farmers are planting barley.
5096864	eng	This test suite is unstable.
5097095	eng	That's what we did next.
5097706	eng	Maybe some examples will help?
5097814	eng	I have a fatigue problem.
5097941	eng	This is an amazing result.
5098019	eng	Here's a message for you.
5098026	eng	Do all that is necessary.

5098193	eng	That's what we're waiting on.
5098194	eng	That's what we're aiming for.
5098195	eng	That's what we always wanted.
5098196	eng	That's the reason we're here.
5098197	eng	That wasn't a tough decision.
5098198	eng	That was the only difference.
5098199	eng	That was our biggest problem.
5098200	eng	That was a huge breakthrough.
5098201	eng	That might've been a mistake.
5098202	eng	That certainly won't be easy.
5098203	eng	Tell us what you're thinking.
5098204	eng	Tell us something about that.
5098205	eng	So what are the implications?
5098206	eng	People want to be understood.
5098207	eng	People thought we were crazy.
5098208	eng	People need to remember that.
5098209	eng	People may not remember that.
5098236	eng	That was a tough decision.
5098554	eng	Praised be the sun god!
5098603	eng	I will forever be immortal.
5098608	eng	They had to elope somehow.
5099013	eng	Tom accused Mary of theft.
5099135	eng	It is a cherry-picking concept.
5099232	eng	I'm not one to judge.
5099252	eng	Our choices are very limited.
5099253	eng	Nothing seemed to be working.
5099255	eng	Nothing is being thrown away.
5099256	eng	Not everything you try works.
5099257	eng	Not everyone is so confident.
5099258	eng	Nobody will ever replace you.
5099259	eng	No one was seriously injured.
5099260	eng	Monday's game was rained out.

5124911	eng	Doors open when you're friendly.
5124918	eng	I didn't like that game.
5125036	eng	You still haven't learned yet.
5125414	eng	I'm going to my sister's.
5125421	eng	The false alarm caused panic.
5125477	eng	Can I hold your baby?
5125492	eng	He spent a sleepless night.
5125496	eng	I passed a sleepless night.
5125795	eng	I graduated three years ago.
5125798	eng	Mary isn't Tom's biological daughter.
5125966	eng	"Whose glasses are those?" "Hers."
5126113	eng	I am living in Japan.
5126118	eng	What is in your hands?
5126122	eng	Is this a new photo?
5126186	eng	Let's make Tatoeba great again!
5126189	eng	Let's make Tatoeba great again.
5126315	eng	You must rewrite this text.
5126418	eng	Alexander ruled for thirteen years.
5126493	eng	I'm a very careful person.
5126494	eng	I'll probably get hammered drunk.
5126498	eng	We close at 7 p.m.
5126499	eng	You have a fine beard.
5126500	eng	I was stuck in traffic.
5126528	eng	Children played around the tree.
5126542	eng	They're not interested in politics.
5126543	eng	You don't need to lie.
5126559	eng	I'm interested in buying it.
5126568	eng	The pain wouldn't go away.
5126572	eng	Tom has an interesting background.
5126624	eng	Be kind to all animals.
5126625	eng	The letter has just arrived.
5127325	eng	He's forcing me to decide.
5127334	eng	She should take my advice.
5127361	eng	I want a clear answer.
5127367	eng	He worked for the council.
5127427	eng	Tom has co-authored three textbooks.
5127430	eng	Tom is planning a trip.
5127431	eng	Tom is quite the conversationalist.
5127432	eng	Tom isn't a professional musician.
5127434	eng	Tom murdered his own father.
5128124	eng	We're closing around 7 p.m.
5128366	eng	I let the opportunity pass.
5128370	eng	She doesn't seem very modest.
5128375	eng	Do you want a refill?
5128384	eng	The winter schedule has arrived.
5128400	eng	Bugs are attracted to light.
5128411	eng	He's known to appear sluggish.
5128416	eng	She slammed on the brakes.
5129405	eng	Don't you know her name?
5129465	eng	Confinement can drive you insane.
5129476	eng	The women paraded around seminude.
5129547	eng	Plants can't grow without water.
5129549	eng	Plants can't grow without air.
5129555	eng	No one loves you, Tom.
5129556	eng	No one loves you, Mary.
5129609	eng	We ran to the fire.
5129715	eng	Could you please fix this?
5129914	eng	Tom's explanation was very confusing.
5129915	eng	I couldn't understand Tom's explanation.
5130111	eng	Tom's children speak French perfectly.
5130115	eng	Tom's passport has been confiscated.
5130123	eng	Tom's prediction was almost right.
5130124	eng	Tom's background is in accounting.
5130125	eng	Tom was arrested Monday afternoon.
5130126	eng	Tom remains in critical condition.
5130128	eng	Tom's license has been revoked.
5130130	eng	Tom has suggested another option.
5130131	eng	Tom's wife Mary predeceased him.
5130132	eng	Tom's family lives in Australia.
5130137	eng	Tom's troubles aren't over yet.
5130138	eng	Tom wears very thick glasses.
5130139	eng	Nobody wanted to believe Tom.
5130141	eng	I should tell Tom everything.
5130144	eng	Doesn't Tom have any friends?
5130145	eng	Where could Tom possibly be?
5130151	eng	Tom was an exchange student.
5130152	eng	Tom was a perfect gentleman.
5130154	eng	Tom tried to defend himself.
5130158	eng	Tom thought nobody was home.
5130159	eng	Tom thought Mary was guilty.
5130160	eng	Tom thanked Mary for coming.
5130161	eng	Tom taught Mary many things.
5130162	eng	Tom shouldn't be here today.
5130163	eng	Tom seemed a little stunned.
5130172	eng	Tom is really stressed out.
5130176	eng	Tom is a potential witness.
5130177	eng	That was what Tom wanted.
5130261	eng	Could you fix this, please?
5130710	eng	I'm not defending that idiot.
5130723	eng	Tom picked flowers for Mary.
5130751	eng	You are a beautiful couple.
5130752	eng	That doesn't fly with me.
5130783	eng	We don't take any prisoners.
5130815	eng	Get ready and let’s go!
5130843	eng	The king is the best.
5130854	eng	We're going to the bar.
5130855	eng	We're going to the discotheque.
5130883	eng	Support me on this one.
5130898	eng	You really liked that woman.
5130899	eng	What you said didn't happen.
5130998	eng	You son of a bitch!
5131208	eng	She has a handsome boyfriend.
5131325	eng	Tom's opinions are generally conservative.
5131326	eng	That's something you'll never understand.
5131327	eng	That's a pretty straightforward question.
5131332	eng	That's a really dangerous intersection.
5131403	eng	You gotta win that debate!
5131406	eng	He has stolen from us.
5131407	eng	She has stolen from us.
5131411	eng	You are doing something inappropriate.
5131417	eng	It has left me speechless.
5131427	eng	I'll do it right away!
5131438	eng	He's a very good friend.
5131467	eng	I'm in a shitty mood.
5131530	eng	There's nothing more to add.
5131945	eng	The sum was rounded up.
5131957	eng	I know her by sight.
5131966	eng	When you're older, you'll understand.
5131967	eng	We're taking ourselves too seriously.
5131968	eng	That's something that isn't possible.
5131969	eng	That's something people wonder about.
5131970	eng	That's basically what they're saying.
5131971	eng	That's a really interesting question.
5131972	eng	Can long distance relationships work?
5131974	eng	You'll understand when you're older.
5131975	eng	What you're proposing is ridiculous.
5131976	eng	We're approximately the same weight.
5131977	eng	We're approximately the same height.
5131979	eng	That's something we're looking into.
5131980	eng	Everyone has been really supportive.
5131982	eng	What's the world's biggest problem?
5131983	eng	We're still looking for volunteers.
5132003	eng	She acts like a child.
5132023	eng	He stepped on the brake.
5132104	eng	This tree will never blossom.
5132105	eng	These trees will never blossom.
5132106	eng	When will the trees blossom?
5132132	eng	The wind is blowing violently.
5132138	eng	A little breeze is blowing.
5132148	eng	What did Socrates write about?
5132159	eng	What did Tom write about?
5132162	eng	That's probably just a coincidence.
5132166	eng	Something's really wrong, isn't it?
5132170	eng	Have you actually learned anything?
5132171	eng	Everyone is welcome to participate.
5132173	eng	Everybody knows where Australia is.
5132174	eng	That's what we're working towards.
5132175	eng	That's what they're worried about.
5132176	eng	That's something we'll improve on.
5132177	eng	That's a truly revolutionary idea.
5132181	eng	Everyone looked relaxed and happy.
5132182	eng	What's your least favorite class?
5132183	eng	We've missed a great opportunity.
5132184	eng	We're approximately the same age.
5132185	eng	We're all best friends, actually.
5132186	eng	That's something we've never had.
5132187	eng	That's probably what they'll say.
5132188	eng	That's especially true right now.
5132189	eng	That's a very difficult question.
5132190	eng	That's a pretty strong statement.
5132191	eng	Isn't that how competition works?
5132192	eng	What's your least favorite food?
5132193	eng	We're stocking up on everything.
5132194	eng	We're pretty proud of ourselves.
5132195	eng	We're not afraid of competition.
5132196	eng	That's what we're worried about.
5132197	eng	That's what we're talking about.
5132198	eng	That's what they're looking for.
5132199	eng	That's the most important thing.
5132200	eng	That's something to think about.
5132201	eng	That's quite an impressive list.
5132203	eng	That's pretty common these days.
5132204	eng	That's a whole different matter.
5132205	eng	That's a very specific question.
5132207	eng	What's your opinion about that?
5132208	eng	What's your favorite junk food?
5132209	eng	What's the worst case scenario?
5132210	eng	What exactly is the difference?
5132211	eng	We're pretty pleased with that.
5132212	eng	We're not looking for sympathy.
5132215	eng	That's the number one priority.
5132216	eng	That's the most important part.
5132217	eng	That's our number one priority.
5132651	eng	I'll do it right away.
5132652	eng	That's exactly what it's about.
5132653	eng	That's a whole different story.
5132654	eng	That's a very compelling story.
5132655	eng	That opportunity has been lost.
5132656	eng	It didn't make much difference.
5132657	eng	Isn't that what really matters?
5132658	eng	Isn't that obvious to everyone?
5132659	eng	Is French your native language?
5132660	eng	How dangerous is the situation?
5132661	eng	Everyone needs to stay focused.
5132662	eng	Everyone needs to quit whining.
5132663	eng	Everyone has something to lose.
5132664	eng	Can that really be coincidence?
5132665	eng	You'd probably really like it.
5132666	eng	Will that make any difference?
5132667	eng	Why was everyone so surprised?
5132668	eng	Why is insurance so important?
5132845	eng	He was born in Greece.
5133106	eng	Your father is a gorilla.
5133737	eng	I have to go pee.
5133784	eng	We're very serious about this.
5133785	eng	We're very nervous about that.
5133786	eng	We're running out of patience.
5133787	eng	We're running a little behind.
5133788	eng	We're looking forward to that.
5133789	eng	We're here to play basketball.
5133790	eng	We're having a wonderful year.
5133791	eng	We're having a wonderful time.
5133792	eng	We're faster than anyone else.
5133943	eng	Why can't an ostrich fly?
5134100	eng	Put it in the closet.
5134101	eng	Put that in the cupboard.
5134113	eng	"Anything else?" "No, that's it."
5134165	eng	Daddy, where will we go?
5134168	eng	They have nowhere to go.
5134170	eng	Where will we go afterwards?
5134235	eng	She seemed anything but remorseful.
5134237	eng	They heard a violent thunderclap.
5134248	eng	He's sitting in his workshop.
5134249	eng	We'll sneak into bed now.
5134260	eng	She had to kill herself.
5134314	eng	This house is my grandfather's.
5134316	eng	This house is my mother's.
5134381	eng	This article is badly written.
5134382	eng	They're obviously a good team.
5134383	eng	There's no running water here.
5134384	eng	There's no reasoning with you.
5134385	eng	There really is no difference.
5134386	eng	The plan is working perfectly.
5134387	eng	That's why people are worried.
5134388	eng	That's what we've always used.
5134389	eng	That's what we're looking for.
5134390	eng	That's what we always thought.
5134391	eng	That's what it's really worth.
5134392	eng	That's plain enough, isn't it?
5134393	eng	That's not the important part.
5134394	eng	That's just good common sense.
5134395	eng	That's basically what we want.
5134396	eng	That's apparently not a crime.
5134397	eng	That's a very simple question.
5134398	eng	That's a very optimistic view.
5134399	eng	That's a very different thing.
5134400	eng	That's a good point, actually.
5134401	eng	That's a common attitude here.
5134402	eng	That wasn't a good experience.
5134403	eng	That was certainly a surprise.
5134404	eng	That was an excellent article.
5134405	eng	That was actually pretty cool.
5134406	eng	That may be an understatement.
5134407	eng	That made no sense whatsoever.
5134408	eng	Thanks for keeping us updated.
5134409	eng	Thanks for keeping me updated.
5134410	eng	Surely there was some mistake.
5134411	eng	Sorry, it's not your decision.
5134445	eng	Something smells good in here.
5134446	eng	Some people are still worried.
5134447	eng	Some people are pretty scared.
5134448	eng	People thought that was crazy.
5134450	eng	People are always saying that.
5134451	eng	One man was seriously injured.
5134452	eng	Now, let's see some enthusiasm.
5134453	eng	Many things will be different.
5134454	eng	Many people have been injured.
5134455	eng	Many people are still missing.
5134456	eng	It's not a permanent solution.
5134457	eng	It's not a difficult question.
5134458	eng	It's a very important message.
5134459	eng	It's a very chaotic situation.
5134460	eng	It'll only make matters worse.
5134461	eng	It'll be interesting for sure.
5134462	eng	It'll be a difficult decision.
5134463	eng	It was an unfortunate mistake.
5134812	eng	Is French your first language?
5134813	eng	Has anyone thought about this?
5134814	eng	Has anyone thought about that?
5134815	eng	Everything's been easy for us.
5134816	eng	Everyone was talking about it.
5134817	eng	Both crew members were killed.
5134818	eng	Are they really any different?
5134821	eng	Team sports are very popular.
5134822	eng	Perhaps it's not that simple.
5134823	eng	Interest rates are still low.
5134824	eng	What surprised you the most?
5134825	eng	We're about the same weight.
5134833	eng	Do you know sign language?
5134837	eng	It's hard to ignore Tom.
5135003	eng	Everybody knows that it worked.
5135004	eng	Everybody knows about that now.
5135005	eng	Competition is a healthy thing.
5135006	eng	Bullying is a learned behavior.
5135007	eng	Breakfast is an important meal.
5135008	eng	We thought we were invincible.
5135011	eng	We need to prioritize things.
5135014	eng	Free snacks will be provided.
5135023	eng	It's really hard to choose.
5135024	eng	I have absolutely no money.
5135030	eng	It's very, very hot here.
5135031	eng	It's still a great story.
5135032	eng	It's quite a simple idea.
5135033	eng	Tom watches too much TV.
5135454	eng	All the proposals are tentative.
5135455	eng	All equipment must be sanitized.
5135456	eng	Actually, the problem isn't new.
5135457	eng	You'll probably need some help.
5135458	eng	We've had a difficult schedule.
5135459	eng	Tom understood what was needed.
5135460	eng	Tom knew something was missing.
5135462	eng	This isn't really anything new.
5135463	eng	They're a good basketball team.
5135464	eng	They say nothing is impossible.
5135465	eng	They aren't ready for anything.
5135466	eng	There were no serious injuries.
5135467	eng	That was Tom's biggest mistake.
5135468	eng	That may be a misunderstanding.
5135469	eng	That makes no sense whatsoever.
5135470	eng	Thanks for keeping us informed.
5135471	eng	Maybe there isn't a difference.
5135472	eng	Keep your thoughts to yourself.
5135473	eng	It's really hard to comprehend.
5135474	eng	It's makes absolutely no sense.
5135475	eng	It's important to have courage.
5135476	eng	It was an unfortunate incident.
5135477	eng	Free parking will be available.
5135478	eng	Everything is in place already.
5135479	eng	Everybody leaves Tom alone now.
5135480	eng	Everybody knows their own name.
5135808	eng	It definitely was a possibility.
5135809	eng	It was an incredible experience.
5135810	eng	It's a very difficult situation.
5135811	eng	It's important to keep learning.
5135812	eng	It's no different anywhere else.
5135813	eng	It's not really that surprising.
5135814	eng	Maybe we'll be working together.
5135815	eng	Not everyone was that impressed.
5135816	eng	Someone isn't telling the truth.
5135817	eng	Something isn't right with this.
5135818	eng	Sometimes kids make bad choices.
5135819	eng	There simply isn't enough money.
5135820	eng	There were people with injuries.
5135821	eng	There will be many restrictions.
5135822	eng	There will be tough competition.
5135823	eng	These problems are all solvable.
5135824	eng	Those two things aren't related.
5135826	eng	You'd better try something else.
5135827	eng	You're a very interesting woman.
5135828	eng	You're making a serious mistake.
5135829	eng	You're obviously in great shape.
5135830	eng	You're only making things worse.
5135831	eng	You've made quite an impression.
5136079	eng	It isn't really particularly healthy.
5136097	eng	I'm heading towards Stockholm now.
5136111	eng	Keep yourself alive during winter.
5136139	eng	Who's really good in German?
5136155	eng	The paperback version is cheaper.
5136391	eng	I know, your busy too.
5136396	eng	She cried all bloody night.
5136433	eng	It won't budge one bit.
5136453	eng	There is no persuading him.
5136464	eng	Tom's got a sore throat.
5136498	eng	I will come tomorrow morning.
5136536	eng	Do you have a mother?
5136537	eng	Does he have a mother?
5136538	eng	Does she have a mother?
5136539	eng	Is his mother still living?
5136540	eng	Is her mother still living?
5136543	eng	She gave me a pencil.
5136561	eng	Do only what I did!
5136838	eng	Is your mother still living?
5136839	eng	Are your parents still living?
5136897	eng	You've missed the point entirely.
5136898	eng	You're really looking much better.
5136899	eng	You're not taking this seriously.
5136900	eng	You're making absolutely no sense.
5136902	eng	Unfortunately, it's not that easy.
5136905	eng	This is an unfortunate situation.
5136906	eng	This all sounds extremely familiar.
5136907	eng	They're not your friends anymore.
5136908	eng	They're not offering us anything.
5136909	eng	They thought they were invincible.
5136910	eng	They only worry about themselves.
5136911	eng	They all looked somewhat stunned.
5136913	eng	There's something that isn't right.
5136914	eng	There's nothing wrong with renting.
5136917	eng	Something's not right about this.
5136918	eng	Something's not quite right here.
5136919	eng	Something obviously has upset you.
5136920	eng	Something isn't right about this.
5136922	eng	Something here isn't quite right.
5136923	eng	Something here isn't making sense.
5136924	eng	Please be prepared for emergencies.
5136925	eng	Maybe we'll play some basketball.
5136926	eng	It's only a minor misunderstanding.
5136927	eng	It's not anybody else's business.
5136928	eng	It's important to understand why.
5136929	eng	It's important that you understand.

5466974	eng	Tom is unable to read.
5466977	eng	You shouldn't drive so fast.
5467362	eng	Come back here right now.
5467363	eng	Tom knew he was wrong.
5467366	eng	People often ask me that.
5467376	eng	You shouldn't have run away.
5467377	eng	I was talking with Tom.
5467378	eng	Don't leave me like this.
5467661	eng	Tom may well be right.
5467664	eng	Would you like to start?
5467667	eng	Tom may win this time.
5467672	eng	Nobody came to work today.
5467675	eng	I'd like to forget Tom.
5468437	eng	I want an answer now.
5468439	eng	Are you also from Boston?
5468447	eng	Nothing comes easy for us.
5468453	eng	I've had a good time.
5468685	eng	Are you from Boston, too?
5468688	eng	I'm going out with Tom.
5468693	eng	Our team has good players.

5468701	eng	Can I borrow an umbrella?

5469034	eng	Be more careful next time.
5469039	eng	Tom slipped me a note.
5469044	eng	I can't go home again.
5469045	eng	Tom smells like a dog.
5469048	eng	You speak French really well.
5469215	eng	Pretend you didn't see me.
5469218	eng	Tom thinks I love him.
5469221	eng	I think we'll be fine.
5469223	eng	Don't you know the truth?
5469225	eng	You're an artist, aren't you?
5469231	eng	Put this in your backpack.
5469673	eng	Papiamento is a creole language.
5469746	eng	Tom took pity on Mary.
5469747	eng	I think you look sexy.
5469753	eng	Get down from that ladder.
5469757	eng	Quit before it's too late.
5469758	eng	Tom tried to trick us.
5469760	eng	That boy's name is Tom.
5469763	eng	I was aching all over.
5469926	eng	These shoes cost too much.
5469947	eng	You clearly aren't very happy.
5469949	eng	Give me that book, please.
5469951	eng	It's not you I hate.
5469953	eng	Running a farm isn't easy.
5469956	eng	Tom walks with a limp.
5469959	eng	I don't know this road.
5469963	eng	You could've been really hurt.
5471296	eng	Tom was an honest man.
5471297	eng	Some people can't do that.
5471301	eng	This is a bad deal.
5471305	eng	May I borrow an umbrella?
5471308	eng	Tom was my role model.
5471309	eng	Keep all the doors locked.
5471311	eng	It smells bad in here.
5471360	eng	Some people can't do this.
5471363	eng	I must apologize to Tom.
5471364	eng	This is a hard job.
5471367	eng	Tom went home by taxi.
5471370	eng	You haven't seen anything yet.
5471373	eng	Tom went home on foot.
5471374	eng	It'll be a long night.
5471379	eng	Tom will come at 2:30.
5471570	eng	Where are the other guys?
5471572	eng	You love Christmas, don't you?
5471579	eng	I hope Tom will come.
5471580	eng	We can at least try.
5471583	eng	Tom also has a brother.
5471584	eng	I liked everyone I met.
5471680	eng	Why didn't you slow down?
5471682	eng	You understand why, don't you?
5471684	eng	Driving a truck isn't easy.
5471689	eng	Tom barely said a word.
5471691	eng	I'm feeling sad for Tom.
5471695	eng	Tom began to eat lunch.
5471696	eng	Why didn't you take that?
5471762	eng	Don't you have any more?
5471923	eng	Everything seemed to be OK.
5471924	eng	Tom can swim very fast.
5471927	eng	Somebody came to our house.
5471933	eng	I see you're all awake.

5474191	eng	Are you looking for these?
5474194	eng	Their son's name is Tom.
5474197	eng	It's so hard to decide.
5474205	eng	Tom has gone back home.
5474206	eng	I wonder who drew this.
5474210	eng	You delivered the wrong package.
5474211	eng	Tom has the right idea.
5474286	eng	It'll be very, very hot.
5474288	eng	Only three people were hurt.
5474289	eng	Tom hasn't paid us yet.
5474294	eng	I'll fix it right away.
5474296	eng	Are you the hotel manager?

5475005	eng	We just did our job.
5475009	eng	I can't move any faster.
5475010	eng	Tom isn't a clever boy.
5476224	eng	You are a strange man.
5476226	eng	Because you are an idiot!
5478186	eng	Don't you like that smell?
5478194	eng	Running a farm is difficult.

5479686	eng	Does Tom run every day?
5479691	eng	I just need some advice.

5499259	eng	I understand what they're saying.
5499271	eng	That puppy is so adorable.

5502544	eng	That happened to us, too.
5502545	eng	Tom came home after dark.
5502548	eng	That isn't a good reason.
5502549	eng	Tom is always very aggressive.
5502551	eng	Tom came home dead tired.
5502552	eng	That was a great comment.
5502554	eng	I'm only telling the truth.

5503055	eng	And are you happy now?
5503702	eng	My mother tongue is Hungarian.
5503970	eng	Hungarian is my mother tongue.
5504003	eng	I'll kick your head off.
5504532	eng	That's not Tom. That's John.
5504533	eng	Tom should've asked for help.
5504537	eng	Tom should've gone weeks ago.
5504538	eng	We hope that you're ready.
5504541	eng	Tom should've won last night.
5504544	eng	We made too many mistakes.
5504545	eng	We've made too many mistakes.

5506465	eng	I love going to concerts.

5506612	eng	I look better than her.
5506617	eng	I don't understand you sometimes.
5506624	eng	May I have a napkin?
5506966	eng	Why are you following us?
5506968	eng	Why should anyone be mad?
5506970	eng	Do you think this'll work?
5506976	eng	We must do this ourselves.
5506978	eng	We probably won't do that.
5507186	eng	We'll never do that again.
